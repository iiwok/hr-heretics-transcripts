So, the meeting's supposed to be at 2:30
in the afternoon, whatever. I join and
 
in the afternoon, whatever. I join and
I'm sitting there. Normally at like four
 
I'm sitting there. Normally at like four
minutes in, I send an email. This time I
 
minutes in, I send an email. This time I
waited until five and I was like, "Are
 
waited until five and I was like, "Are
we still meeting? He still wasn't
 
we still meeting? He still wasn't
there." He goes, "Yes, just wrapping up
 
there." He goes, "Yes, just wrapping up
a demo." And still, this is a minute
 
a demo." And still, this is a minute
later. I was at 2:36 and I'm like, "All

situation." And so my response back was
no heads up or apology doesn't sit well.
 
no heads up or apology doesn't sit well.
I'm going to protect my time and
 
I'm going to protect my time and
politely
 
politely
decline. And so I left the meeting. So
 
decline. And so I left the meeting. So
anyways, I posted this on LinkedIn and I
 
anyways, I posted this on LinkedIn and I
said, I want your feedback. Like was I
 
said, I want your feedback. Like was I
too harsh or do we need more community
 
too harsh or do we need more community
regulation when people break social
 
regulation when people break social
etiquette? What's your take on this,
 
etiquette? What's your take on this,
Kelly? Well, I read it. I think the
 
Kelly? Well, I read it. I think the
first thing I thought of was something
 
first thing I thought of was something
going on with you that day. Because I'll
 
going on with you that day. Because I'll
speak for myself, if I'm stressed or if
 
speak for myself, if I'm stressed or if
I have 10 meetings in a day with no
 
I have 10 meetings in a day with no
buffer, no nothing, and someone pulls
 
buffer, no nothing, and someone pulls
that, I'm annoyed. That's exactly what
 
that, I'm annoyed. That's exactly what
was going on. Okay. So, I figured
 
was going on. Okay. So, I figured
perhaps the reaction might have been
 
perhaps the reaction might have been
different if it was only your third
 
different if it was only your third
meeting of the day and you had an hour
 
meeting of the day and you had an hour
and a half free before. Like, you
 
and a half free before. Like, you
probably would have reacted differently.
 
probably would have reacted differently.
True. But but but to that point, I think
 
True. But but but to that point, I think
we should assume that everyone's really
 
we should assume that everyone's really
busy, right? So anyway, but that just
 
busy, right? So anyway, but that just
knowing you and that's how how I work.
 
knowing you and that's how how I work.
If I'm like insane and someone does
 
If I'm like insane and someone does
that, I have less I have less less leash
 
that, I have less I have less less leash
for them that I would I wasn't stressed.
 
for them that I would I wasn't stressed.
But in this work, in this world, you got
 
But in this work, in this world, you got
to assume that people are stretched and
 
to assume that people are stretched and
busy and doing a bunch of different
 
busy and doing a bunch of different
things. Every everyone who knows me, I
 
things. Every everyone who knows me, I
have a big issue with being tardy and
 
have a big issue with being tardy and
late. I think it's a sign of disrespect
 
late. I think it's a sign of disrespect
and selfishness. So, I mean, you know
 
and selfishness. So, I mean, you know
this, Nolan, we've worked together now
 
this, Nolan, we've worked together now
for two years. I always text. I always
 
for two years. I always text. I always
ping. Hey, I'm going to be three minutes
 
ping. Hey, I'm going to be three minutes
late. Blah blah blah. I think it's
 
late. Blah blah blah. I think it's
really important to do that and it's a
 
really important to do that and it's a
sign of frankly collaboration and time
 
sign of frankly collaboration and time
management. So, I do accent more on
 
management. So, I do accent more on
that.
 
that.
I will say though, I don't tend to get
 
I will say though, I don't tend to get
annoyed if it's like one time.
 
annoyed if it's like one time.
So, to be honest with you, if it was
 
So, to be honest with you, if it was
this situation, because I didn't know if
 
this situation, because I didn't know if
this was someone you were working with
 
this was someone you were working with
all the time, if you know, you knew this
 
all the time, if you know, you knew this
person, like maybe give them a little
 
person, like maybe give them a little
more grace if they're trying to build a
 
more grace if they're trying to build a
company and they've got demos and all
 
company and they've got demos and all
these
 
these
things. But if it's the only time, I
 
things. But if it's the only time, I
probably would have hung on. I would
 
probably would have hung on. I would
have taken the six minutes and thanked
 
have taken the six minutes and thanked
my lucky stars for a few minutes of
 
my lucky stars for a few minutes of
breathing room. Nailed a few emails, but
 
breathing room. Nailed a few emails, but
when they got on, I would have been
 
when they got on, I would have been
like, "It's fine. You're late. I got
 
like, "It's fine. You're late. I got
some stuff done. We You have like
 
some stuff done. We You have like
literally 20 minutes." Yeah, you nailed
 
literally 20 minutes." Yeah, you nailed
it with the like what was going on. Cuz
 
it with the like what was going on. Cuz
normally like I am like I have a longer
 
normally like I am like I have a longer
leash on those things. But two things at
 
leash on those things. But two things at
that moment really stood out to me. So
 
that moment really stood out to me. So
one was Colin Zema who was on the show.
 
one was Colin Zema who was on the show.
He's the CEO of Omni. He was at Looker
 
He's the CEO of Omni. He was at Looker
uh when it was acquired by Google. And
 
uh when it was acquired by Google. And
you remember that story he told Kelly of
 
you remember that story he told Kelly of
like the Googler the Googler culture is
 
like the Googler the Googler culture is
if you know if you're three to five
 
if you know if you're three to five
minutes late you're on time. And the
 
minutes late you're on time. And the
looker culture was on time is on time.
 
looker culture was on time is on time.
And so the looker people would get there
 
And so the looker people would get there
first and essentially just be talking
 
first and essentially just be talking
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about all of the Googlers and the
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about all of the Googlers and the
Google c culture about like why these
 
Google c culture about like why these
people can't manage their days or let
 
people can't manage their days or let
people know when they're running late or
 
people know when they're running late or
just be like, you know, generally, you
 
just be like, you know, generally, you
know, courteous as a human being. Yes.
 
know, courteous as a human being. Yes.
Right. That was the first thing. The
 
Right. That was the first thing. The
second thing was it's actually my Andrew
 
second thing was it's actually my Andrew
Monday, who I reported to at Door Dash,
 
Monday, who I reported to at Door Dash,
was like the most ruthless person I've
 
was like the most ruthless person I've
ever seen as it related to his calendar.
 
ever seen as it related to his calendar.
He was the guy who like multiple times
 
He was the guy who like multiple times
seven to 10 minutes into an interview
 
seven to 10 minutes into an interview
who knew it wasn't a fit would stand up
 
who knew it wasn't a fit would stand up
and say this isn't a fit. I'm going to
 
and say this isn't a fit. I'm going to
have Nolan come in and walk you out.
 
have Nolan come in and walk you out.
Which made me like so uncomfortable for
 
Which made me like so uncomfortable for
a long time. And then I kind of got like
 
a long time. And then I kind of got like
used to it and I was like actually like
 
used to it and I was like actually like
I respect that he's trying to save
 
I respect that he's trying to save
everybody's time here. Like maybe we can
 
everybody's time here. Like maybe we can
make it a little bit nicer but just
 
make it a little bit nicer but just
going through the motions to go through
 
going through the motions to go through
the motions I don't actually think makes
 
the motions I don't actually think makes
sense. The big piece for me as I kind of
 
sense. The big piece for me as I kind of
like went through this decision-making
 
like went through this decision-making
framework was like, look, if it's you
 
framework was like, look, if it's you
and I have a relationship, if it's a
 
and I have a relationship, if it's a
client, like dude, like you're paying
 
client, like dude, like you're paying

for my time, I'm just going to sit there
wait for you. Of course, I'm going to do
 
wait for you. Of course, I'm going to do
that. But like when someone's asking me
 
that. But like when someone's asking me

that I'm really not tight with at all to
come jam with them when I have a, you
 
come jam with them when I have a, you
know, pack and again that's like on my
 
know, pack and again that's like on my
own thing. You're totally right about
 
own thing. You're totally right about
that. It's like I just I don't think
 
that. It's like I just I don't think
it's okay. And I would have actually
 
it's okay. And I would have actually
stayed if in that email he was like, I
 
stayed if in that email he was like, I
am so sorry. Right. just getting off a
 
am so sorry. Right. just getting off a
demo because like that was a lot of the

comments on LinkedIn was like Nolan it's
 
comments on LinkedIn was like Nolan it's
a founder you know demos are their
 
a founder you know demos are their
lifeblood like guys you don't think I
 
lifeblood like guys you don't think I
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know
 
that I I think I think I mean you got
 
that I I think I think I mean you got
all sorts of comments on there and I
 
all sorts of comments on there and I
think some of them were a little a
 
think some of them were a little a
little harsh I mean what the reality is
 
little harsh I mean what the reality is
we talk this all the time clarity of
 
we talk this all the time clarity of
identity like don't bash Nolan I mean I
 
identity like don't bash Nolan I mean I
do a lot believe me no you can bash me
 
do a lot believe me no you can bash me
it doesn't bother me. It's just like
 
it doesn't bother me. It's just like
virtue signaling is what I'm like, come

on. No, I mean, you do a lot of things
 
on. No, I mean, you do a lot of things
that are, you know, we talk about it,
 
that are, you know, we talk about it,
but clarity of identity. You have a
 
but clarity of identity. You have a
right to expect what you
 
right to expect what you
expect. Like, you do. And there's
 
expect. Like, you do. And there's
nothing wrong with that. And I guarantee
 
nothing wrong with that. And I guarantee
you that folks that read that or this
 
you that folks that read that or this
person read it, they'll never do it
 
person read it, they'll never do it
again. And the point that I'm making is
 
again. And the point that I'm making is
no matter if I would have done it or
 
no matter if I would have done it or
not, you have a right to do that. It is
 
not, you have a right to do that. It is
important to you and it's clarity of

were stressed. Maybe you got a little
more annoyed than you usually would.
 
more annoyed than you usually would.

that that's kind of true. If you're
Elon, if you're Todd from Pendo, if you
 
Elon, if you're Todd from Pendo, if you
