# Is It Ever Okay to be Late to Meetings?

What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics. All
right, Kelly, I lit LinkedIn on fire. I
saw it and I was like, maybe they do
read this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean, gee, maybe they
do. Okay, this one for me is a topic
that just continues to come up and I
feel like it's about
timeliness. So, let me set the context
for you, which I don't think I did a
very good job of on LinkedIn, but the
high level is a local founder ping me.
We have no relationship other than he
peding me a couple years ago. I took him
to launch, whatever. No other
relationship other than we know of each
other. He will never be a client. I will
never work for him. Right? There's none
of those things. He's early stage is
where I'll leave it. I don't want to
like, you know, out this person. So, he
asked me for time to talk about like
product market fit and like where he's
at in the journey and all this stuff.
And I'm like, sure, like, let's do it.
You're doing him a favor. I think so.
Right. I don't want to like, you know,
get on my high horse, but I think so.
So, the meeting's supposed to be at 2:30
in the afternoon, whatever. I join and
I'm sitting there. Normally at like four
minutes in, I send an email. This time I
waited until five and I was like, "Are
we still meeting? He still wasn't
there." He goes, "Yes, just wrapping up
a demo." And still, this is a minute
later. I was at 2:36 and I'm like, "All
right, I'm like a little peeved on this
situation." And so my response back was
no heads up or apology doesn't sit well.
I'm going to protect my time and
politely
decline. And so I left the meeting. So
anyways, I posted this on LinkedIn and I
said, I want your feedback. Like was I
too harsh or do we need more community
regulation when people break social
etiquette? What's your take on this,
Kelly? Well, I read it. I think the
first thing I thought of was something
going on with you that day. Because I'll
speak for myself, if I'm stressed or if
I have 10 meetings in a day with no
buffer, no nothing, and someone pulls
that, I'm annoyed. That's exactly what
was going on. Okay. So, I figured
perhaps the reaction might have been
different if it was only your third
meeting of the day and you had an hour
and a half free before. Like, you
probably would have reacted differently.
True. But but but to that point, I think
we should assume that everyone's really
busy, right? So anyway, but that just
knowing you and that's how how I work.
If I'm like insane and someone does
that, I have less I have less less leash
for them that I would I wasn't stressed.
But in this work, in this world, you got
to assume that people are stretched and
busy and doing a bunch of different
things. Every everyone who knows me, I
have a big issue with being tardy and
late. I think it's a sign of disrespect
and selfishness. So, I mean, you know
this, Nolan, we've worked together now
for two years. I always text. I always
ping. Hey, I'm going to be three minutes
late. Blah blah blah. I think it's
really important to do that and it's a
sign of frankly collaboration and time
management. So, I do accent more on
that.
I will say though, I don't tend to get
annoyed if it's like one time.
So, to be honest with you, if it was
this situation, because I didn't know if
this was someone you were working with
all the time, if you know, you knew this
person, like maybe give them a little
more grace if they're trying to build a
company and they've got demos and all
these
things. But if it's the only time, I
probably would have hung on. I would
have taken the six minutes and thanked
my lucky stars for a few minutes of
breathing room. Nailed a few emails, but
when they got on, I would have been
like, "It's fine. You're late. I got
some stuff done. We You have like
literally 20 minutes." Yeah, you nailed
it with the like what was going on. Cuz
normally like I am like I have a longer
leash on those things. But two things at
that moment really stood out to me. So
one was Colin Zema who was on the show.
He's the CEO of Omni. He was at Looker
uh when it was acquired by Google. And
you remember that story he told Kelly of
like the Googler the Googler culture is
if you know if you're three to five
minutes late you're on time. And the
looker culture was on time is on time.
And so the looker people would get there
first and essentially just be talking
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about all of the Googlers and the
Google c culture about like why these
people can't manage their days or let
people know when they're running late or
just be like, you know, generally, you
know, courteous as a human being. Yes.
Right. That was the first thing. The
second thing was it's actually my Andrew
Monday, who I reported to at Door Dash,
was like the most ruthless person I've
ever seen as it related to his calendar.
He was the guy who like multiple times
seven to 10 minutes into an interview
who knew it wasn't a fit would stand up
and say this isn't a fit. I'm going to
have Nolan come in and walk you out.
Which made me like so uncomfortable for
a long time. And then I kind of got like
used to it and I was like actually like
I respect that he's trying to save
everybody's time here. Like maybe we can
make it a little bit nicer but just
going through the motions to go through
the motions I don't actually think makes
sense. The big piece for me as I kind of
like went through this decision-making
framework was like, look, if it's you
and I have a relationship, if it's a
client, like dude, like you're paying
for my time, I'm just going to sit there
wait for you. Of course, I'm going to do
that. But like when someone's asking me
that I'm really not tight with at all to
come jam with them when I have a, you
know, pack and again that's like on my
own thing. You're totally right about
that. It's like I just I don't think
it's okay. And I would have actually
stayed if in that email he was like, I
am so sorry. Right. just getting off a
demo because like that was a lot of the
comments on LinkedIn was like Nolan it's
a founder you know demos are their
lifeblood like guys you don't think I
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know
 
that I I think I think I mean you got
all sorts of comments on there and I
think some of them were a little a
little harsh I mean what the reality is
we talk this all the time clarity of
identity like don't bash Nolan I mean I
do a lot believe me no you can bash me
it doesn't bother me. It's just like
virtue signaling is what I'm like, come
on. No, I mean, you do a lot of things
that are, you know, we talk about it,
but clarity of identity. You have a
right to expect what you
expect. Like, you do. And there's
nothing wrong with that. And I guarantee
you that folks that read that or this
person read it, they'll never do it
again. And the point that I'm making is
no matter if I would have done it or
not, you have a right to do that. It is
important to you and it's clarity of
identity. Now again, I I suspected you
were stressed. Maybe you got a little
more annoyed than you usually would.
Yeah, true. When I do that, I tend to
think about it as helpful for me,
especially when I don't need to meet
with them. I either stay on and text or
do some work and enjoy the seven minutes
and tell them they had 10 minutes or I'm
like, "Listen, I was on for seven
minutes. If you want to reschedule, go
ahead. I'm
off." And usually then they'll come back
extremely
apologetic. Hey everyone, we'll be right

I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Dosha who leads talent at Signal Fire
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick." Metave is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver. Because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
MeteView covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metav. Head over to
metave.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metab's product experts. Tell them that
me and Kelly sent you. Or you could just
go to their website and get started for
free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in minutes.
You know, I gotta go back to like my
childhood right now because I feel like
this is the other piece. I know it was
something and that's fine. Yeah, but
it's Kelly like when we work with other
people, right, and we're at fault and we
just expect them to deal with our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
without taking any sort of
accountability or apologizing or
acknowledging. It's like I really
struggle with that. Like my mother would
never take that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me. Did did
did he acknowledge after? So this is the
Yeah. Thank you for asking. So
essentially what he said was like you're
right. I'm so sorry. If you know you
have a few minutes while you're in the
car, call me. Let's kind of still like
ask you. So it was like I thought it was
like an okay like fine response. I swear
to God I am not making this up. I put
this on I did not put this on LinkedIn.
I put this on my like my private
Instagram to tell my friends about what
happened because I was so stunned by the
the next move. He didn't use my
calendarly again. He just moved the
call, which was on Thursday, to the same
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time on Friday on my calendar.
Just moved it. Oh no. And I was like,
what world are we living in? Like what
is going like already I'm like social
etiquette fauxpaw. Like not cool. Who
raised you is like what's in my head.
Then the second piece of just like,
yeah, I'm just going to like just move
this thing over to, by the way, that was
four o'clock on Friday was the next one.
And I was like, what is happening here?
Like, and here's here's kind of like I
actually think you'll resonate with this
thought because I did have this thought,
which
was it seems that if you have founder in
your title, you no longer are subject to
the rules of the road of the rest of the
population. And look, I actually think
that that's kind of true. If you're
Elon, if you're Todd from Pendo, if you
matter, like if you matter, I'm I'm
like, dude, I'll wait for you. You know,
like you're a big deal. I'll wait for
you. If no one's ever heard of you, like
I'm sorry, you don't get the special
carpool. I love it. You're judging
whether someone matters or not by their
founder. So maybe he went to founder
mode, dude, and he just That's I think
this is part of that. I I I I said only
this is where I like probably went way
overboard, but it's like there's a
little societal rot here like that's
going down and it's kind of like one of
those things to where like you're
watching something and it's wrong,
right? There's an unwritten rule.
There's all of these things in society
that we have unwritten rules about. In
baseball, there's a ton of them, right?
It's like if you throw at our best
hitter, we're going to throw at your
best hitter. That's how baseball is. And
a lot of that stuff is just governed
amongst the players. And I feel like we
have a lot of that stuff in society,
too. A lot of it's just governed with
how we interact with each other. And
Kelly, I think this is actually
especially true the higher you get into
an organization, right? None of this
stuff is codified. It's just expected.
It's an unwritten rule. And I do feel
like a lot of this stuff in society is
like sliding. Like we're just like it's
and it feels like a very slippery slope
of what we're on. It's like I'm kind of
tired of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And maybe it's like
a get off my lawn sort of
situation. It kind of feels like that as
I'm saying it right now. But don't we
need to stand up for more things? Don't
we need to have higher expectations of
people? I hear what you say about
societal rot. I think look I think to be
honest I think you're all overreacting
to this. It's little little little
silly. I was like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going
on? But the story after made me chuckle
like the no calendar the move like I bet
my left ankle. this this company doesn't
make it. Let's put it that way. So, but
I I think it's a little s like I I tend
to just how do I make the best of this?
Like fine, you want to reschedule, but
you have a personal this is really
important to you and that and that is my
comment to everyone on LinkedIn. Who
cares if I think it's a little silly and
no one got a little wound too tight?
It's important to him. And I'll tell
you, I have one too and Hillary always
laughs at me. I can't stand when people
text me or email me without
pleasantries.
You gotta have a hi. How's it going? How
are you doing? It's just how I like to
do business. I don't like blah blah blah
blah blah. I'm like, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm
reading my writing attitude.
Interesting. I love a good pleasantry.
Those of you who know me, I rarely write
anything unless it's like, "Hey, how's
it going? What's going on?" Yeah. You
always hit off with Hey PayPal every
time. It's really helpful and I do
believe it helps get things business
done better. That's a good one, Kelly. I
like that. That's the thing for me.
Okay, we all have them. Everyone needs
to just relax. Yeah. I actually think
this this will start a good kind of like
what's what's your unwritten rule? Yeah.
Right. And and in times of pressure, how
does that amp up? Because I read it, I
was like, "Oh man." Like I could see
Nolan being like, "No heads up, but no
apology." I'm like, "Oh, his feelings
are hurt. He must be having like a day."
God. But I do think the environment
around us ramps up our our wick and how
long it is for these things. Yeah, it it
does. All right. Let us know what your
favorite unwritten rule is. Let us know
your take on societal rot. Yeah. And
always using all talent or I have to
hear about it. Yeah. Appreciate you
