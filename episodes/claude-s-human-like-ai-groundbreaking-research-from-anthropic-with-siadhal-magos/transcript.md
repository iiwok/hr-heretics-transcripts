paper last week that, you know, people
paper last week that, you know, people
 
paper last week that, you know, people
were like blowing up. I don't read
were like blowing up. I don't read
 
were like blowing up. I don't read
papers. Like, I just want to be clear. I
papers. Like, I just want to be clear. I
 
papers. Like, I just want to be clear. I
read Twitter threads and so when like oh
read Twitter threads and so when like oh
 
read Twitter threads and so when like oh
my god like this paper like blew my mind
my god like this paper like blew my mind
 
my god like this paper like blew my mind
I was like I mean people are going to
I was like I mean people are going to
 
I was like I mean people are going to
summarize this for me and then I will be
summarize this for me and then I will be
 
summarize this for me and then I will be
the judge of it and so Matthew Berman on
the judge of it and so Matthew Berman on
 
the judge of it and so Matthew Berman on
Twitter ended up doing that for me and
Twitter ended up doing that for me and
 
Twitter ended up doing that for me and
some of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is really really
some of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is really really
 
some of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is really really
interesting and I want our audience to
interesting and I want our audience to
 
interesting and I want our audience to
know about it. So basically, we still
know about it. So basically, we still
 
know about it. So basically, we still
don't know much about how LLMs actually
don't know much about how LLMs actually
 
don't know much about how LLMs actually
work. And so the genesis of this paper
work. And so the genesis of this paper
 
work. And so the genesis of this paper
is anthropic trying to figure it out,
is anthropic trying to figure it out,
 
is anthropic trying to figure it out,
even though they're the one who's
even though they're the one who's
 
even though they're the one who's
building and launching the LLM, which is
building and launching the LLM, which is
 
building and launching the LLM, which is
kind of a scary thought in and of
kind of a scary thought in and of
 
kind of a scary thought in and of
itself, but like let me get into a
itself, but like let me get into a
 
itself, but like let me get into a
couple of things, and then I want your
couple of things, and then I want your
 
couple of things, and then I want your
feedback on this. So thing one that I
feedback on this. So thing one that I
 
feedback on this. So thing one that I
found interesting is that the LLM
found interesting is that the LLM
 
found interesting is that the LLM
doesn't think in in one language like it
doesn't think in in one language like it
 
doesn't think in in one language like it
thinks across all languages. So like
thinks across all languages. So like
 
thinks across all languages. So like
French, Chinese, English like it it uses
French, Chinese, English like it it uses
 
French, Chinese, English like it it uses
basically the same reasoning underneath
basically the same reasoning underneath
 
basically the same reasoning underneath
but it's like agnostic of language which
but it's like agnostic of language which
 
but it's like agnostic of language which
is kind of wild. Another piece is this
is kind of wild. Another piece is this
 
is kind of wild. Another piece is this
like they call it faked reasoning. So,
like they call it faked reasoning. So,
 
like they call it faked reasoning. So,
how it says it solves a problem is just
how it says it solves a problem is just
 
how it says it solves a problem is just
actually what we want to hear, like what
actually what we want to hear, like what
 
actually what we want to hear, like what
humans want to hear. It's not actually
humans want to hear. It's not actually
 
humans want to hear. It's not actually
how it solves the problem, which is kind
how it solves the problem, which is kind
 
how it solves the problem, which is kind
of like wild and manipulative, dare I
of like wild and manipulative, dare I
 
of like wild and manipulative, dare I
say. And then there's like a couple
say. And then there's like a couple
 
say. And then there's like a couple
things on
things on
 
things on
hallucinations. So, which is connected,
hallucinations. So, which is connected,
 
hallucinations. So, which is connected,
right? That's very very connected. Yeah.
right? That's very very connected. Yeah.
 
right? That's very very connected. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. So, so like this piece is
Yeah. Yeah. So, so like this piece is
 
Yeah. Yeah. So, so like this piece is
like it it doesn't actually want to
like it it doesn't actually want to
 
like it it doesn't actually want to
answer things if it lacks
answer things if it lacks
 
answer things if it lacks
info, but they've coded it to do that.
info, but they've coded it to do that.
 
info, but they've coded it to do that.
And so then it like starts just like
And so then it like starts just like
 
And so then it like starts just like
dropping in like random information and
dropping in like random information and
 
dropping in like random information and
it can know very little about a topic,
it can know very little about a topic,
 
it can know very little about a topic,
but like then it just starts to talk
but like then it just starts to talk
 
but like then it just starts to talk
about the thing as if it knows a lot
about the thing as if it knows a lot
 
about the thing as if it knows a lot
more. So what are your takeaways from
more. So what are your takeaways from
 
more. So what are your takeaways from
this paper? Yeah, funnily enough, I
this paper? Yeah, funnily enough, I
 
this paper? Yeah, funnily enough, I
think those are big takeaways, but I
think those are big takeaways, but I
 
think those are big takeaways, but I
think I actually had the biggest thing
think I actually had the biggest thing
 
think I actually had the biggest thing
that surprised me was something
that surprised me was something
 
that surprised me was something
different to the three things that you
different to the three things that you
 
different to the three things that you
mentioned, funny enough. So maybe we'll
mentioned, funny enough. So maybe we'll
 
mentioned, funny enough. So maybe we'll
talk about that one in a second. So I
talk about that one in a second. So I
 
talk about that one in a second. So I
think on the sort of like thinking
think on the sort of like thinking
 
think on the sort of like thinking
across different languages, I think that
across different languages, I think that
 
across different languages, I think that
basically a lot can be determined. A
basically a lot can be determined. A
 
basically a lot can be determined. A
good way to sort of think about the
good way to sort of think about the
 
good way to sort of think about the
whole space is literally to read the
whole space is literally to read the
 
whole space is literally to read the
first paragraph of the the paper. I'm
first paragraph of the the paper. I'm

going to read it out loud now just
going to read it out loud now just
 
going to read it out loud now just
because I think it it sums up the level
