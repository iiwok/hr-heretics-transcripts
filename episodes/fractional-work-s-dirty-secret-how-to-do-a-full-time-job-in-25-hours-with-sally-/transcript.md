&gt;&gt; Thank you. It's a joy.
 
&gt;&gt; Thank you. It's a joy.
&gt;&gt; All right. So Sally like the way I pitch
 
&gt;&gt; All right. So Sally like the way I pitch
forche is you guys are doing interim
 
forche is you guys are doing interim
placements and executive placements. Is
 
placements and executive placements. Is
that right?
 
that right?
&gt;&gt; It is we make great teams executive
 
&gt;&gt; It is we make great teams executive
search we do interim and then we make
 
search we do interim and then we make
teams great. So that's kind of that team
 
teams great. So that's kind of that team
performance side. I mean it sounds
 
performance side. I mean it sounds
holistic and like airy fairy but it's
 
holistic and like airy fairy but it's
actually like how you do great teams is
 
actually like how you do great teams is
you have to think about the whole team.
 
you have to think about the whole team.
&gt;&gt; What I found building continuum is that
 
&gt;&gt; What I found building continuum is that
every executive wants access to
 
every executive wants access to
fractional opportunities. Yes.
 
fractional opportunities. Yes.
&gt;&gt; And yet there is I would say still
 
&gt;&gt; And yet there is I would say still
significant resistance from the demand
 
significant resistance from the demand
side. So from companies and what we
 
side. So from companies and what we
found with the demand side is
 
found with the demand side is
there's like a big trust barrier to
 
there's like a big trust barrier to
overcome if it's coming like if the
 
overcome if it's coming like if the
person's coming from a marketplace and
 
person's coming from a marketplace and
not from a trusted intermediary.
 
not from a trusted intermediary.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And that feels like a very antiquated
 
&gt;&gt; And that feels like a very antiquated
view like what have you guys learned
 
view like what have you guys learned
about fractional and how is it working?
 
about fractional and how is it working?
&gt;&gt; So relational is the what matters most?
 
&gt;&gt; So relational is the what matters most?
we are the VC without I mean VC money,
 
we are the VC without I mean VC money,
right? So, we're we're giving them the
 
right? So, we're we're giving them the
trusted source. And so, when we give a
 
trusted source. And so, when we give a
client a slate of talents, I'll say,
 
client a slate of talents, I'll say,
"Here's Kelly, here's John, here's, you
 
"Here's Kelly, here's John, here's, you
know, Jane, and here's the strengths of
 
know, Jane, and here's the strengths of
each, and this is how we know them." The
 
each, and this is how we know them." The
reason I think we've stayed in business
 
reason I think we've stayed in business
this long through three recessions
 
this long through three recessions
is because we can give them more than
 
is because we can give them more than
one choice. So, we're kind of a mix
 
one choice. So, we're kind of a mix
between a marketplace where you were
 
between a marketplace where you were
given a lot of choice and just like if
 
given a lot of choice and just like if
the VC doesn't love that one person
 
the VC doesn't love that one person
that's like not a great search
 
that's like not a great search
experience where it's like do you like
 
experience where it's like do you like
them or not? It's too binary. So, we're
 
them or not? It's too binary. So, we're
kind of that middle place. So, I think
 
kind of that middle place. So, I think
your point is right around relational
 
your point is right around relational
and why we've survived you know three
 
and why we've survived you know three
downturns in terms of mindset of the
 
downturns in terms of mindset of the
buyer. So companies want all in when
 
buyer. So companies want all in when
things were really hot postco
 
things were really hot postco
they would take anything anything with a
 
they would take anything anything with a
heartbeat right was like in. So then I
 
heartbeat right was like in. So then I
think the market flooded with fractional
 
think the market flooded with fractional
people they were like I can name my
 
people they were like I can name my
price I can live my best life. So the
 
price I can live my best life. So the
demand and the supply for sure have been
 
demand and the supply for sure have been
out of equilibrium
 
out of equilibrium
and and the supply is is demanding like
 
and and the supply is is demanding like
people are exhausted. They think
 
people are exhausted. They think
fractional is the answer, but but
 
fractional is the answer, but but
clients are still like, "Oh, I only want
 
clients are still like, "Oh, I only want
people who are not exhausted, so
 
people who are not exhausted, so
therefore I want the all-in."
 
therefore I want the all-in."
&gt;&gt; I think what I learned is that the TAM
 
&gt;&gt; I think what I learned is that the TAM
is a lot smaller than I expected.
 
is a lot smaller than I expected.
Because for me, it just makes sense to
 
Because for me, it just makes sense to
be able to like, okay, Sally is world
 
be able to like, okay, Sally is world
class at this thing. I can't hire her
 
class at this thing. I can't hire her
full-time. I should tap into her for
 
full-time. I should tap into her for
this thing on a fractional basis. But
 
this thing on a fractional basis. But
companies don't think in that way. At
 
companies don't think in that way. At
least venturebacked tech companies don't
 
least venturebacked tech companies don't
think in that way. And my question is
 
think in that way. And my question is
like why? I think the TAM is actually
 
like why? I think the TAM is actually
high. What happens is like once that
 
high. What happens is like once that
company has relationships with people,
 
company has relationships with people,
they don't need you anymore. They
 
they don't need you anymore. They
literally have their Rolodex and it
 
literally have their Rolodex and it
becomes a micro network.
 
becomes a micro network.
So, I think the demand is high for
 
So, I think the demand is high for
people who have lived it successfully.
 
people who have lived it successfully.
And there's also a lot of like, let's be
 
And there's also a lot of like, let's be
honest, there's a lot of people out
 
honest, there's a lot of people out
there that are like, I'm fractional, and
 
there that are like, I'm fractional, and
they're just not they're not great. And
 
they're just not they're not great. And
people get burned and then fractional
 
people get burned and then fractional
becomes branded, not the person.
 
becomes branded, not the person.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Yep. that VC hiring market falls out
 
Yep. that VC hiring market falls out
basically in April of 22 is like when we
 
basically in April of 22 is like when we
saw like a really big hit in our
 
saw like a really big hit in our
business and then everyone started
 
business and then everyone started
getting laid off and everyone who got
 
getting laid off and everyone who got
laid off did this thing where they went
 
laid off did this thing where they went
on their LinkedIn and said now I'm
 
on their LinkedIn and said now I'm
fractional
 
fractional
and what ended up happening was
 
and what ended up happening was
fractional went from this like very
 
fractional went from this like very
elite thing that only like you know call
 
elite thing that only like you know call
it like the top five to 10% of people
 
it like the top five to 10% of people
had access to
 
had access to
&gt;&gt; right
 
&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt; to now now it's actually an adverse
 
&gt;&gt; to now now it's actually an adverse
selection problem Like if you say you're
 
selection problem Like if you say you're
fractional on LinkedIn, I now think you
 
fractional on LinkedIn, I now think you
suck.
 
suck.
&gt;&gt; Do you want to know what I think the
 
&gt;&gt; Do you want to know what I think the
dirty secret of fractional is? And I'm
 
dirty secret of fractional is? And I'm
going to be really honest here. Like
 
going to be really honest here. Like
honestly, you guys, there's really no
 
honestly, you guys, there's really no
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] such thing as fractional. Like
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] such thing as fractional. Like
if you come in and just say, "Well, I'm
 
if you come in and just say, "Well, I'm
 
meeting or no, I'm not going to do
 
meeting or no, I'm not going to do
that." You're kind of out. Like the
 
that." You're kind of out. Like the
secret of fractional is to try to build
 
secret of fractional is to try to build
so much trust and influence and
 
so much trust and influence and
understand this business and what needs
 
understand this business and what needs
to be done so well that you can do a
 
to be done so well that you can do a
full-time job in 25 hours. And I think
 
full-time job in 25 hours. And I think
that's where a lot of fractional people
 
that's where a lot of fractional people
fail is because they've kind of done it
 
fail is because they've kind of done it
once or they got laid off or fired null
 
once or they got laid off or fired null
and they weren't that good. They try to
 
and they weren't that good. They try to
come in and do this with boundaries that
 
come in and do this with boundaries that
just backfire in their face.
 
just backfire in their face.
&gt;&gt; I totally agree. When it's interim, we
 
&gt;&gt; I totally agree. When it's interim, we
interview differently. We're like, "How
 
interview differently. We're like, "How
quickly can you build trust?" Like, tell
 
quickly can you build trust?" Like, tell
me examples of how quickly you can get
 
me examples of how quickly you can get
in, get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done. How do you manage
 
in, get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done. How do you manage
boundaries? How do you manage
 
boundaries? How do you manage
expectations? And boundaries isn't like,
 
expectations? And boundaries isn't like,
"I can't do dot dot dot." Boundaries is
 
"I can't do dot dot dot." Boundaries is
is this a priority? Let's are the
 
is this a priority? Let's are the
priorities shifting? How do we negotiate
 
priorities shifting? How do we negotiate
that? Well, what are your skills around
 
that? Well, what are your skills around
influence and negotiation? Like that
 
influence and negotiation? Like that
matters so much more. I got people from

HR. And one of my favorite conversations
 
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
 
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
 
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
 
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
 
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
 
trust, and workplaces where folks

&gt;&gt; Who's primarily like the buyer that
 
&gt;&gt; Who's primarily like the buyer that
you're working with?
 
you're working with?
&gt;&gt; So certainly if it's a smaller company,

So, like I don't really care what the
title is. I just care, do you have a
 
title is. I just care, do you have a
budget? Do you have a problem that we
 
budget? Do you have a problem that we
can quickly solve? And are you not an
 
can quickly solve? And are you not an

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
&gt;&gt; With early stage companies, they say
 
&gt;&gt; With early stage companies, they say
like because they can't hire well. So,
 
like because they can't hire well. So,
that's why they think about fractional,
 
that's why they think about fractional,
right? They don't have access to the
 
right? They don't have access to the
talent pool. They're like, "Okay, like
 
talent pool. They're like, "Okay, like
Kelly's only working 10 hours a week. I
 
Kelly's only working 10 hours a week. I
actually need 40. So, I'm just going to
 
actually need 40. So, I'm just going to
try and squeeze 40 into 10 and like ruin
 
try and squeeze 40 into 10 and like ruin
Kelly's life. Then for the later stage
 
Kelly's life. Then for the later stage
companies, there's kind of like this
 
companies, there's kind of like this
issue with ego. So, how do you overcome
 
issue with ego. So, how do you overcome
like those sorts of object objections
 
like those sorts of object objections
and issues?
 
and issues?
&gt;&gt; It's actually one of the reasons we've
 
&gt;&gt; It's actually one of the reasons we've
loved working with finance the last
 
loved working with finance the last
year. We don't have to explain how much
 
year. We don't have to explain how much
money we we are saving to a CFO and with
 
money we we are saving to a CFO and with
the chief people officer. We have to be
 
the chief people officer. We have to be
like, remember that benefits load and
 
like, remember that benefits load and
remember bonuses and stock like you're
 
remember bonuses and stock like you're
not paying any of that. Finance people
 
not paying any of that. Finance people
are better clients to be honest.
 
are better clients to be honest.
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about the hourly rate
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about the hourly rate
for a second. So, how do people price
 
for a second. So, how do people price
themselves and what do you find as
 
themselves and what do you find as
effective strategies?
 
effective strategies?
&gt;&gt; So, we have a transparent pay structure
 
&gt;&gt; So, we have a transparent pay structure
between our clients and our talent. It's
 
between our clients and our talent. It's
 
reversed. So, we're paying taxes. We're
 
reversed. So, we're paying taxes. We're
paying all the insuranceances. So, our
 
paying all the insuranceances. So, our
actual like so gross margin of 35 is not
 
actual like so gross margin of 35 is not
much, right? It's like the app store
 
much, right? It's like the app store
because we're an employer. So, our net
 
because we're an employer. So, our net
margin is not very much.
 
margin is not very much.
We don't go below a hundred bucks bill
 
We don't go below a hundred bucks bill
rate. So if they haven't done the work
 
rate. So if they haven't done the work
at all, I I mean it depends on their
 
at all, I I mean it depends on their
level. So if they're director level,
 
level. So if they're director level,
I'll you know, usually a $100 net. So
 
I'll you know, usually a $100 net. So
right, so they're making $100 an hour,
 
right, so they're making $100 an hour,
but again, we're paying our side of the
 
but again, we're paying our side of the
taxes. That's still a $200,000 job where
 
taxes. That's still a $200,000 job where
they have the flexibility, the benefits,
 
they have the flexibility, the benefits,
etc. Most directors will be okay in
 
etc. Most directors will be okay in
that. Some people want 150.
 
that. Some people want 150.
CPOS will want, you know, up to 300. We
 
CPOS will want, you know, up to 300. We
have some who can get as much as 400,
 
have some who can get as much as 400,
but then they're not working very many
 
but then they're not working very many
hours. It's more advisory. So, it goes
 
hours. It's more advisory. So, it goes
back to like are you advising or are you
 
back to like are you advising or are you
rolling up your sleeves and doing a lot
 
rolling up your sleeves and doing a lot
of the work and that's where a lot of
 
of the work and that's where a lot of
the tradeoff happens and rates. I just
 
the tradeoff happens and rates. I just
want to be clear because I'm used to
 
want to be clear because I'm used to
like not getting benefits. Do you know
 
like not getting benefits. Do you know
what I mean? Not being W2. So, it's just
 
what I mean? Not being W2. So, it's just
a really important distinction I want to
 
a really important distinction I want to
put on there. Like you all are offering
 
put on there. Like you all are offering
those items which are expensive, better
 
those items which are expensive, better
tax treatment. The other thing we
 
tax treatment. The other thing we
noticed is there's like a honeymoon
 
noticed is there's like a honeymoon
phase for these engagements and so you
 
phase for these engagements and so you
know like first couple weeks like oh
 
know like first couple weeks like oh
like especially if you're smart
 
like especially if you're smart
executive and you get a quick win right
 
executive and you get a quick win right
like you build trust early like that
 
like you build trust early like that
shit's great and then typically what
 
shit's great and then typically what
happens is the company tries to like
 
happens is the company tries to like
extract more out of the executive. How
 
extract more out of the executive. How
do you guys handle those things? So this
 
do you guys handle those things? So this
goes to us screening to make sure that
 
goes to us screening to make sure that
the consultants are really consultants
 
the consultants are really consultants
and they can manage that. Most of the
 
and they can manage that. Most of the
time Nolan, we have people who are more
 
time Nolan, we have people who are more
like the Kelly's who are I know how to
 
like the Kelly's who are I know how to
handle this. We're looking for people
 
handle this. We're looking for people
who know how to consult versus who are
 
who know how to consult versus who are
employees and are just using to grind.
 
employees and are just using to grind.
Like there's some middle ground of like
 
Like there's some middle ground of like
we can coach them a little bit, but if
 
we can coach them a little bit, but if
they require a lot of coaching and
 
they require a lot of coaching and
they're going to just be a re a
 
they're going to just be a re a
recipient of grind, then they're not
 
recipient of grind, then they're not
great for this role. This is where I
 
great for this role. This is where I
think it really has to come on that
 
think it really has to come on that
exec. I don't care if you're making 300,
 
exec. I don't care if you're making 300,
 
it up a little bit. Like, you got to
 
it up a little bit. Like, you got to
give away some free stuff to get out
 
give away some free stuff to get out
there and build trust and build
 
there and build trust and build
commitment. That goodwill is really
 
commitment. That goodwill is really
important. Whether you're an entry-
 
important. Whether you're an entry-
level employee, a big powerful
 
level employee, a big powerful
executive, a consultant, like you got to
 
executive, a consultant, like you got to
sometimes put down the ego and grind and
 
sometimes put down the ego and grind and
be a part of the team and earn that no
 
be a part of the team and earn that no
matter what you're doing. But I think
 
matter what you're doing. But I think
most of the time what we've been talking
 
most of the time what we've been talking
about is if there's an open role and
 
about is if there's an open role and
they're asking you to fill an open role,
 
they're asking you to fill an open role,
then they're asking you to be
 
then they're asking you to be
essentially the equivalent of an FTE,
 
essentially the equivalent of an FTE,
right? But that's not all the roles.
 
right? But that's not all the roles.
There's a lot of roles where it's like
 
There's a lot of roles where it's like
we might have an open role and we need
 
we might have an open role and we need
something for that. But it might be that
 
something for that. But it might be that
like they're in scaling mode. That tends
 
like they're in scaling mode. That tends
to be more where we get called and they
 
to be more where we get called and they
need like a person and a half. And so
 
need like a person and a half. And so
they might have a person in RO and they
 
they might have a person in RO and they
need that extra half, right? or they
 
need that extra half, right? or they
might have a person to roll and they
 
might have a person to roll and they
need another whole person because
 
need another whole person because
they're scaling so quickly. So there's a
 
they're scaling so quickly. So there's a
lot of ways to think about fractional
 
lot of ways to think about fractional
that is about growth, not just about are
 
that is about growth, not just about are
we trying to not hire an FTE and
 
we trying to not hire an FTE and
therefore squeeze them and treat them
 
therefore squeeze them and treat them
like an FTE, right? That and that's why
 
like an FTE, right? That and that's why
CFOs and CEOs tend to be better at like
 
CFOs and CEOs tend to be better at like
thinking about the more modular way
 
thinking about the more modular way
versus just like I'm not sure who to
 
versus just like I'm not sure who to
hire from an FTE perspective, so I'm
 
hire from an FTE perspective, so I'm
going to hire this fractional person and
 
going to hire this fractional person and
treat them like an FTE. That's when it
 
treat them like an FTE. That's when it
gets tricky.
 
gets tricky.
&gt;&gt; Sally, how do you assess
 
&gt;&gt; Sally, how do you assess
the executives on your platform? And how
 
the executives on your platform? And how
do you tell companies to assess them?
 
do you tell companies to assess them?
&gt;&gt; So, how do we assess the candidates?
 
&gt;&gt; So, how do we assess the candidates?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I mean, it's behavioral
 
&gt;&gt; Oh, I mean, it's behavioral
interviewing.
 
interviewing.
It's like behavioral interviewing with
 
It's like behavioral interviewing with
that extra layer of can you consult? If
 
that extra layer of can you consult? If
it's the fractional side, we look for
 
it's the fractional side, we look for
influencing skills, ability to be more
 
influencing skills, ability to be more
like a project-based thinker versus just
 
like a project-based thinker versus just
just a grinder. Like we're looking for a
 
just a grinder. Like we're looking for a
metacognition person, someone who thinks
 
metacognition person, someone who thinks
about how they think, right? Who can
 
about how they think, right? Who can
prioritize and push back, who
 
prioritize and push back, who
understands the business because if they
 
understands the business because if they
don't understand the business, they
 
don't understand the business, they
can't push back with good data and is
 
can't push back with good data and is
really good at EQ because they have to
 
really good at EQ because they have to
have that ability to build trust quickly
 
have that ability to build trust quickly
and then also read how to be effective.
 
and then also read how to be effective.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then how do you tell the
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then how do you tell the
company to assess those candidates?
 
company to assess those candidates?
&gt;&gt; I don't find a fractionable size. I do
 
&gt;&gt; I don't find a fractionable size. I do
have one difference. I say don't look
 
have one difference. I say don't look
for 100%. an executive search, they're
 
for 100%. an executive search, they're
always looking for 100%. And with
 
always looking for 100%. And with
interim, I'm like, if they're at like
 
interim, I'm like, if they're at like
 
progress over perfection.
 
progress over perfection.
&gt;&gt; That feels very counterintuitive to me.
 
&gt;&gt; That feels very counterintuitive to me.
What you're essentially saying is lower
 
What you're essentially saying is lower
the bar for fractional.
 
the bar for fractional.
&gt;&gt; So different. So if they didn't have
 
&gt;&gt; So different. So if they didn't have
skills like the key skills of like
 
skills like the key skills of like
influencing, good communication, 100%.
 
influencing, good communication, 100%.
That's just like I think that is
 
That's just like I think that is
hygiene. We're talking about the nice to
 
hygiene. We're talking about the nice to
have stuff like the if you have a job
 
have stuff like the if you have a job
description, they're like I want them to
 
description, they're like I want them to
have this kind of industry experience. I
 
have this kind of industry experience. I
want them to have these three things.
 
want them to have these three things.
They must have stayed there for 5 years
 
They must have stayed there for 5 years
each. Like all the things in executive
 
each. Like all the things in executive
search that are ridiculous. We're like,
 
search that are ridiculous. We're like,
all you need are key skills of this, get
 
all you need are key skills of this, get
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done, you know, easy to work with.
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done, you know, easy to work with.
Go. Like it's much more about progress
 
Go. Like it's much more about progress
than it is like I need this person needs
 
than it is like I need this person needs
to be loyal to me and stay for three
 
to be loyal to me and stay for three
years and you know, all that stuff. It's
 
years and you know, all that stuff. It's
like no. You've been doing this since
 
like no. You've been doing this since
 
of fractional people? So how do you tell
 
of fractional people? So how do you tell
good versus not? So we used to call it
 
good versus not? So we used to call it
interim because it didn't back to your
 
interim because it didn't back to your
point of like is it a fraction or is it
 
point of like is it a fraction or is it
a whole right because the fraction could
 
a whole right because the fraction could
be 1.2x of their time.
 
be 1.2x of their time.
&gt;&gt; They mean different things inter
 
&gt;&gt; They mean different things inter
&gt;&gt; right right so we think more interim.
 
&gt;&gt; right right so we think more interim.
The way that we used to think about it
 
The way that we used to think about it
before was like it was to Nolan's point
 
before was like it was to Nolan's point
kind of like someone's not there so
 
kind of like someone's not there so
maternity backfill or someone quickly
 
maternity backfill or someone quickly
resigned or had a health issue and we
 
resigned or had a health issue and we
would plug someone in. The market has
 
would plug someone in. The market has
gotten better. I don't have to lecture
 
gotten better. I don't have to lecture
them which I'm sure no one loved but I
 
them which I'm sure no one loved but I
think the modular consulting starts is
 
think the modular consulting starts is
going to remain true and important in
 
going to remain true and important in
the future of work. Meaning what problem
 
the future of work. Meaning what problem
are we solving? Nolan what skills might
 
are we solving? Nolan what skills might
we need? Maybe it's 40 hours a week of
 
we need? Maybe it's 40 hours a week of
this person. Maybe it's 30 hours a week
 
this person. Maybe it's 30 hours a week
of this skill set. and just thinking
 
of this skill set. and just thinking
more like that modular and experiments.
 
more like that modular and experiments.
That's kind of more of the direction
 
That's kind of more of the direction
that we advise both candidates and
 
that we advise both candidates and
clients.
 
clients.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. When somebody comes to you and
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. When somebody comes to you and
they're like, "Hey, I really want to do
 
they're like, "Hey, I really want to do
fractional work." What do you tell those
 
fractional work." What do you tell those
people? What's your advice to them?
 
people? What's your advice to them?
&gt;&gt; I basically say until I have a real gig
 
&gt;&gt; I basically say until I have a real gig
to talk to you about, like, let's just
 
to talk to you about, like, let's just
put a pin in this. When I have a client
 
put a pin in this. When I have a client
need that fits something that matters to
 
need that fits something that matters to
you. So, what I ask them is what are the
 
you. So, what I ask them is what are the
things that matter to you? Is it the
 
things that matter to you? Is it the
CEO? Is it the culture? Is it your
 
CEO? Is it the culture? Is it your
commute? Is it the number of hours? like
 
commute? Is it the number of hours? like
is it your pay? It can't be all of it.
 
is it your pay? It can't be all of it.
Like real estate. If we see a project
 
Like real estate. If we see a project
that meets several of these, we'll give
 
that meets several of these, we'll give
you a call and then we'll diagnose
 
you a call and then we'll diagnose
quickly as to whether this person is
 
quickly as to whether this person is
going to work in this scenario because
 
going to work in this scenario because
there's too many scenarios.
 
there's too many scenarios.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Here's a real question. I hear
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Here's a real question. I hear
everyone bitching all the time. I sent
 
everyone bitching all the time. I sent
my stuff in. I had a great chat with
 
my stuff in. I had a great chat with
Nolan or Sally or Third Bridge or
 
Nolan or Sally or Third Bridge or
whoever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. I didn't hear from
 
whoever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. I didn't hear from
him again. What the hell is happening
 
him again. What the hell is happening
here? Does it really go into a black
 
here? Does it really go into a black
hole or are they just not great? Like
 
hole or are they just not great? Like
what happens? No, there's just more.
 
what happens? No, there's just more.
Back to Nolan's point, there's more
 
Back to Nolan's point, there's more
supply than demand.
 
supply than demand.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Your your eye is definitely on them.
 
&gt;&gt; Your your eye is definitely on them.
It's just
 
It's just
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, they're in the database.
 
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, they're in the database.
Is my eye on We have 10,000 people in
 
Is my eye on We have 10,000 people in
the database. No, mine.
 
the database. No, mine.
&gt;&gt; Exactly, Sally. Like, people don't get
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly, Sally. Like, people don't get
that. Like, Kelly, this is actually the
 
that. Like, Kelly, this is actually the
problem with this model. It's a huge
 
problem with this model. It's a huge
problem for us, which is executives are
 
problem for us, which is executives are
used to this white glove executive
 
used to this white glove executive
search experience.
 
search experience.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But in the business that Sally is
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But in the business that Sally is
in, it's like you're a number. For
 
in, it's like you're a number. For
people who don't have experience, you're
 
people who don't have experience, you're
probably never going to call them
 
probably never going to call them
because your list is so goddamn long of
 
because your list is so goddamn long of
people who you've already worked with
 
people who you've already worked with
who have done great work. And so only if
 
who have done great work. And so only if
they're solving a very specific niche
 
they're solving a very specific niche
problem will you pick up the phone and
 
problem will you pick up the phone and
call them. Isn't that the honest to god
 
call them. Isn't that the honest to god
truth?
 
truth?
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And to Nolan's point, anyone
 
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And to Nolan's point, anyone
who's already worked with us is always
 
who's already worked with us is always
the first call. if they're busy or not
 
the first call. if they're busy or not
the right fit, we go to the second rung.
 
the right fit, we go to the second rung.
So, it's like anything else, right? Like
 
So, it's like anything else, right? Like
it's you go with your trusted people
 
it's you go with your trusted people
first and the people who come in, we
 
first and the people who come in, we
need them because some of those other
 
need them because some of those other
people have retired, they've made their
 
people have retired, they've made their
FU money, you know, like it's a constant
 
FU money, you know, like it's a constant
like we care about getting new talent
 
like we care about getting new talent
for sure, but we just can't meet with
 
for sure, but we just can't meet with
them all until we have a live project.
 
them all until we have a live project.
This is brilliant because I didn't ask
 
This is brilliant because I didn't ask
the question to tee this up because I am
 
the question to tee this up because I am
just not that smart today. But this is
 
just not that smart today. But this is
perfect because it does tee up the exact
 
perfect because it does tee up the exact
point I want to make which we've talked
 
point I want to make which we've talked
about so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] times Nolan is you
 
about so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] times Nolan is you
cannot rely on other people or companies
 
cannot rely on other people or companies
or platforms to get you stuff and
 
or platforms to get you stuff and
network for you and get like like we've
 
network for you and get like like we've
had lunch. I can help you because of the
 
had lunch. I can help you because of the
leg work I did myself to network and
 
leg work I did myself to network and
then that has other great effects and
 
then that has other great effects and
this and that. Side note, if you want to
 
this and that. Side note, if you want to
get time with Sally, buy her lunch.
 
get time with Sally, buy her lunch.
maybe a martini one, but that nothing
 
maybe a martini one, but that nothing
replaces that. And so when I have
 
replaces that. And so when I have
friends that call and complain about
 
friends that call and complain about
this black holeness,
 
this black holeness,
it's like you can sit around and
 
it's like you can sit around and
complain about this or you can actually
 
complain about this or you can actually
do some leg work. And you know what I
 
do some leg work. And you know what I
mean?
 
mean?
&gt;&gt; Oh my god, Kelly. Like highlight that
 
&gt;&gt; Oh my god, Kelly. Like highlight that
bullet double underscore bold it like
 
bullet double underscore bold it like
that. It's so interesting
 
that. It's so interesting
continuum which is kind of like the feed
 
continuum which is kind of like the feed
empty feedback. I would describe it as
 
empty feedback. I would describe it as
empty feet cuz we didn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
empty feet cuz we didn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
which is like, oh, like they never
 
which is like, oh, like they never
called back. And it's like, well, like I
 
called back. And it's like, well, like I
haven't seen you get a job recently, so
 
haven't seen you get a job recently, so
is that my fault, too?
 
is that my fault, too?
&gt;&gt; I mean, to be honest, it's a gift to
 
&gt;&gt; I mean, to be honest, it's a gift to
them. Like, why would I call you if I
 
them. Like, why would I call you if I
have nothing to say? Like, until there's
 
have nothing to say? Like, until there's
a market need that they could address,
 
a market need that they could address,
it's just, you know, like friendship,
 
it's just, you know, like friendship,
which I have wonderful friends. But
 
which I have wonderful friends. But
yeah, I just think I just view these
 
yeah, I just think I just view these
things as working in tandem with great
 
things as working in tandem with great
people and companies like you both have
 
people and companies like you both have
and had versus you all working for me.
 
and had versus you all working for me.
It's a big mindset difference that I
 
It's a big mindset difference that I
think
 
think
is really important.
 
is really important.
&gt;&gt; Well, and to be honest, anyone who's
 
&gt;&gt; Well, and to be honest, anyone who's
kind of a complainer like aren't our
 
kind of a complainer like aren't our
people anyway? So,
 
people anyway? So,
&gt;&gt; well, to be honest, there's not a
 
&gt;&gt; well, to be honest, there's not a
business there.
 
business there.
&gt;&gt; You have to have some resilience. Like
 
&gt;&gt; You have to have some resilience. Like
this business, Andrea on my team, she
 
this business, Andrea on my team, she
she's hilarious. She always talks about
 
she's hilarious. She always talks about
like people's gota like really be able
 
like people's gota like really be able
to roll with it. I can't remember what
 
to roll with it. I can't remember what
the term she uses, but like they have to
 
the term she uses, but like they have to
have some spine. They have to have some
 
have some spine. They have to have some
resilience. And if they're like, "What
 
resilience. And if they're like, "What
have you done for me lately?" Like
 
have you done for me lately?" Like
swipe. Yeah. Speaking of resilience, my
 
swipe. Yeah. Speaking of resilience, my
last question for you, Sally, is how
 
last question for you, Sally, is how
have you kept this up? Like this
 
have you kept this up? Like this
treadmill of this work you've been doing
 
treadmill of this work you've been doing
is almost 15 years and it's been through
 
is almost 15 years and it's been through
all of it. And you said yourself you
 
all of it. And you said yourself you
were kind of in front of it at some
 
were kind of in front of it at some
points getting tomatoes thrown at you at
 
points getting tomatoes thrown at you at
TED talks. Like what's changed? Like how
 
TED talks. Like what's changed? Like how
have you evolved this over the years?
 
have you evolved this over the years?
How do you keep up the relationships?
 
How do you keep up the relationships?
Like what are some of the secrets?
 
Like what are some of the secrets?
&gt;&gt; Running experiments like you know never
 
&gt;&gt; Running experiments like you know never
being too tied into one thing. So I've
 
being too tied into one thing. So I've
done really cool work called work lab
 
done really cool work called work lab
where we design thinking that made works
 
where we design thinking that made works
better. I'm now doing some work with
 
better. I'm now doing some work with
Leslie Pllo at HBS around how do people
 
Leslie Pllo at HBS around how do people
have the most fulfilling lives. Like for
 
have the most fulfilling lives. Like for
me it's about like following my
 
me it's about like following my
northstar which is curiosity.
 
northstar which is curiosity.
Incredibly smart people who are also
 
Incredibly smart people who are also
kind and generous. And if I'm in the
 
kind and generous. And if I'm in the
learning space with the right people,
 
learning space with the right people,
like whatever emerges, we will find the
 
like whatever emerges, we will find the
bottom line. And so far, that's
 
bottom line. And so far, that's
happened.
 
happened.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
 
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; I love that, Sally. This was a blast.
 
&gt;&gt; I love that, Sally. This was a blast.
Thanks so much for educating us. And
 
Thanks so much for educating us. And
also our audience, I think this is like
 
also our audience, I think this is like
one of those honest conversations that
 
one of those honest conversations that
people haven't heard that they need to
 
people haven't heard that they need to
hear. And so, I hope if you're listening
 
hear. And so, I hope if you're listening
to this, like your biggest takeaway is
 
to this, like your biggest takeaway is
is like nobody's managing your career
 
is like nobody's managing your career
except for you. Sally's here to help and
 
except for you. Sally's here to help and
can serve as a little bit of like
 
can serve as a little bit of like
auxiliary, but like she's not your agent
 
auxiliary, but like she's not your agent
and agents for executives don't yet
 
and agents for executives don't yet
exist.
 
exist.
&gt;&gt; It'll be really interesting to see where
 
&gt;&gt; It'll be really interesting to see where
all this fractional stuff goes or ends
 
all this fractional stuff goes or ends
or grows. I just don't know. So, thank
 
or grows. I just don't know. So, thank
you so much, Sally. It was a joy.
 
you so much, Sally. It was a joy.
Anytime we can laugh together, I'm in.
 
Anytime we can laugh together, I'm in.
