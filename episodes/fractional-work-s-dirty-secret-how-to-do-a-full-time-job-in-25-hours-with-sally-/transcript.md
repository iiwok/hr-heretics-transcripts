For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, Kelly and Nolan talked to Sally
Thornton, CEO and founder of Forche, who
offers a candid examination of
fractional executive work, exploring
trust barriers, adverse selection
problems, pricing models, and why
consulting acumen matters more than
traditional executive experience. All
right. Hey everybody, how are you doing?
Welcome to another session here of HR
Heretics. Sally Thornton is joining us
today who's been a friend of mine for a
long time. Sally's been in the game for
gez what 26 27 years in total and has
kind of done it all. tons of HR
leadership roles, advisory roles, board
work, and has owned her own firm for
almost 14 years. Fractional work, all
sorts of exec search, org development,
team building, kind of all of it. And
we're stoked to have you today to talk
about the ups and downs. So, welcome.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. It's a joy.
&gt;&gt; All right. So Sally like the way I pitch
forche is you guys are doing interim
placements and executive placements. Is
that right?
&gt;&gt; It is we make great teams executive
search we do interim and then we make
teams great. So that's kind of that team
performance side. I mean it sounds
holistic and like airy fairy but it's
actually like how you do great teams is
you have to think about the whole team.
&gt;&gt; What I found building continuum is that
every executive wants access to
fractional opportunities. Yes.
&gt;&gt; And yet there is I would say still
significant resistance from the demand
side. So from companies and what we
found with the demand side is
there's like a big trust barrier to
overcome if it's coming like if the
person's coming from a marketplace and
not from a trusted intermediary.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And that feels like a very antiquated
view like what have you guys learned
about fractional and how is it working?
&gt;&gt; So relational is the what matters most?
we are the VC without I mean VC money,
right? So, we're we're giving them the
trusted source. And so, when we give a
client a slate of talents, I'll say,
"Here's Kelly, here's John, here's, you
know, Jane, and here's the strengths of
each, and this is how we know them." The
reason I think we've stayed in business
this long through three recessions
is because we can give them more than
one choice. So, we're kind of a mix
between a marketplace where you were
given a lot of choice and just like if
the VC doesn't love that one person
that's like not a great search
experience where it's like do you like
them or not? It's too binary. So, we're
kind of that middle place. So, I think
your point is right around relational
and why we've survived you know three
downturns in terms of mindset of the
buyer. So companies want all in when
things were really hot postco
they would take anything anything with a
heartbeat right was like in. So then I
think the market flooded with fractional
people they were like I can name my
price I can live my best life. So the
demand and the supply for sure have been
out of equilibrium
and and the supply is is demanding like
people are exhausted. They think
fractional is the answer, but but
clients are still like, "Oh, I only want
people who are not exhausted, so
therefore I want the all-in."
&gt;&gt; I think what I learned is that the TAM
is a lot smaller than I expected.
Because for me, it just makes sense to
be able to like, okay, Sally is world
class at this thing. I can't hire her
full-time. I should tap into her for
this thing on a fractional basis. But
companies don't think in that way. At
least venturebacked tech companies don't
think in that way. And my question is
like why? I think the TAM is actually
high. What happens is like once that
company has relationships with people,
they don't need you anymore. They
literally have their Rolodex and it
becomes a micro network.
So, I think the demand is high for
people who have lived it successfully.
And there's also a lot of like, let's be
honest, there's a lot of people out
there that are like, I'm fractional, and
they're just not they're not great. And
people get burned and then fractional
becomes branded, not the person.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Yep. that VC hiring market falls out
basically in April of 22 is like when we
saw like a really big hit in our
business and then everyone started
getting laid off and everyone who got
laid off did this thing where they went
on their LinkedIn and said now I'm
fractional
and what ended up happening was
fractional went from this like very
elite thing that only like you know call
it like the top five to 10% of people
had access to
&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt; to now now it's actually an adverse
selection problem Like if you say you're
fractional on LinkedIn, I now think you
suck.
&gt;&gt; Do you want to know what I think the
dirty secret of fractional is? And I'm
going to be really honest here. Like
honestly, you guys, there's really no
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] such thing as fractional. Like
if you come in and just say, "Well, I'm
 
meeting or no, I'm not going to do
that." You're kind of out. Like the
secret of fractional is to try to build
so much trust and influence and
understand this business and what needs
to be done so well that you can do a
full-time job in 25 hours. And I think
that's where a lot of fractional people
fail is because they've kind of done it
once or they got laid off or fired null
and they weren't that good. They try to
come in and do this with boundaries that
just backfire in their face.
&gt;&gt; I totally agree. When it's interim, we
interview differently. We're like, "How
quickly can you build trust?" Like, tell
me examples of how quickly you can get
in, get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done. How do you manage
boundaries? How do you manage
expectations? And boundaries isn't like,
"I can't do dot dot dot." Boundaries is
is this a priority? Let's are the
priorities shifting? How do we negotiate
that? Well, what are your skills around
influence and negotiation? Like that
matters so much more. I got people from
Deote, Accenture, people who know how to
scope a project, who can who know what
they can deliver on a certain time
frame. You know, how to bring others
along. Not everyone has that.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it.
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
which uh let's just put it out there.
That sounds pretty boring if you think
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
prevention training, not very exciting,
right? We are very lucky in that we are
in the HR tech space. That's required,
right? Harassment prevention training is
not really optional. You need it. The
question is, who are you going to use
for it?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You're doing this training
whether you want to or not. But here's
what she told us about the impact.
&gt;&gt; The amount of impact that I've been able
to have from the HR perspective has been
just huge. It's phenomenal. We're doing
all these amazing things that quite
frankly too many companies don't do
because they don't understand the power
of their HR team.
&gt;&gt; Instead of boring check the box training
that everyone hates, Athena delivers
content that's modern and impactful.
We're talking 200 plus courses in 100
plus languages with a 93% learner
positivity rating to back it up. They
take on all the tough topics, harassment
prevention, workplace violence
prevention, code of conduct, and make
them actually engaging. And for HR, it's
effortless. Training runs on autopilot
with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
Done right? Like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

&gt;&gt; Who's primarily like the buyer that
you're working with?
&gt;&gt; So certainly if it's a smaller company,
it's the CEO. If it's a mid-size
company, it can be the head of HR,
whatever we call them. We also work with
CFOs. We work with CMOs.
So, like I don't really care what the
title is. I just care, do you have a
budget? Do you have a problem that we
can quickly solve? And are you not an
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
&gt;&gt; With early stage companies, they say
like because they can't hire well. So,
that's why they think about fractional,
right? They don't have access to the
talent pool. They're like, "Okay, like
Kelly's only working 10 hours a week. I
actually need 40. So, I'm just going to
try and squeeze 40 into 10 and like ruin
Kelly's life. Then for the later stage
companies, there's kind of like this
issue with ego. So, how do you overcome
like those sorts of object objections
and issues?
&gt;&gt; It's actually one of the reasons we've
loved working with finance the last
year. We don't have to explain how much
money we we are saving to a CFO and with
the chief people officer. We have to be
like, remember that benefits load and
remember bonuses and stock like you're
not paying any of that. Finance people
are better clients to be honest.
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about the hourly rate
for a second. So, how do people price
themselves and what do you find as
effective strategies?
&gt;&gt; So, we have a transparent pay structure
between our clients and our talent. It's
 
reversed. So, we're paying taxes. We're
paying all the insuranceances. So, our
actual like so gross margin of 35 is not
much, right? It's like the app store
because we're an employer. So, our net
margin is not very much.
We don't go below a hundred bucks bill
rate. So if they haven't done the work
at all, I I mean it depends on their
level. So if they're director level,
I'll you know, usually a $100 net. So
right, so they're making $100 an hour,
but again, we're paying our side of the
taxes. That's still a $200,000 job where
they have the flexibility, the benefits,
etc. Most directors will be okay in
that. Some people want 150.
CPOS will want, you know, up to 300. We
have some who can get as much as 400,
but then they're not working very many
hours. It's more advisory. So, it goes
back to like are you advising or are you
rolling up your sleeves and doing a lot
of the work and that's where a lot of
the tradeoff happens and rates. I just
want to be clear because I'm used to
like not getting benefits. Do you know
what I mean? Not being W2. So, it's just
a really important distinction I want to
put on there. Like you all are offering
those items which are expensive, better
tax treatment. The other thing we
noticed is there's like a honeymoon
phase for these engagements and so you
know like first couple weeks like oh
like especially if you're smart
executive and you get a quick win right
like you build trust early like that
shit's great and then typically what
happens is the company tries to like
extract more out of the executive. How
do you guys handle those things? So this
goes to us screening to make sure that
the consultants are really consultants
and they can manage that. Most of the
time Nolan, we have people who are more
like the Kelly's who are I know how to
handle this. We're looking for people
who know how to consult versus who are
employees and are just using to grind.
Like there's some middle ground of like
we can coach them a little bit, but if
they require a lot of coaching and
they're going to just be a re a
recipient of grind, then they're not
great for this role. This is where I
think it really has to come on that
exec. I don't care if you're making 300,
 
it up a little bit. Like, you got to
give away some free stuff to get out
there and build trust and build
commitment. That goodwill is really
important. Whether you're an entry-
level employee, a big powerful
executive, a consultant, like you got to
sometimes put down the ego and grind and
be a part of the team and earn that no
matter what you're doing. But I think
most of the time what we've been talking
about is if there's an open role and
they're asking you to fill an open role,
then they're asking you to be
essentially the equivalent of an FTE,
right? But that's not all the roles.
There's a lot of roles where it's like
we might have an open role and we need
something for that. But it might be that
like they're in scaling mode. That tends
to be more where we get called and they
need like a person and a half. And so
they might have a person in RO and they
need that extra half, right? or they
might have a person to roll and they
need another whole person because
they're scaling so quickly. So there's a
lot of ways to think about fractional
that is about growth, not just about are
we trying to not hire an FTE and
therefore squeeze them and treat them
like an FTE, right? That and that's why
CFOs and CEOs tend to be better at like
thinking about the more modular way
versus just like I'm not sure who to
hire from an FTE perspective, so I'm
going to hire this fractional person and
treat them like an FTE. That's when it
gets tricky.
&gt;&gt; Sally, how do you assess
the executives on your platform? And how
do you tell companies to assess them?
&gt;&gt; So, how do we assess the candidates?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I mean, it's behavioral
interviewing.
It's like behavioral interviewing with
that extra layer of can you consult? If
it's the fractional side, we look for
influencing skills, ability to be more
like a project-based thinker versus just
just a grinder. Like we're looking for a
metacognition person, someone who thinks
about how they think, right? Who can
prioritize and push back, who
understands the business because if they
don't understand the business, they
can't push back with good data and is
really good at EQ because they have to
have that ability to build trust quickly
and then also read how to be effective.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then how do you tell the
company to assess those candidates?
&gt;&gt; I don't find a fractionable size. I do
have one difference. I say don't look
for 100%. an executive search, they're
always looking for 100%. And with
interim, I'm like, if they're at like
 
progress over perfection.
&gt;&gt; That feels very counterintuitive to me.
What you're essentially saying is lower
the bar for fractional.
&gt;&gt; So different. So if they didn't have
skills like the key skills of like
influencing, good communication, 100%.
That's just like I think that is
hygiene. We're talking about the nice to
have stuff like the if you have a job
description, they're like I want them to
have this kind of industry experience. I
want them to have these three things.
They must have stayed there for 5 years
each. Like all the things in executive
search that are ridiculous. We're like,
all you need are key skills of this, get
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done, you know, easy to work with.
Go. Like it's much more about progress
than it is like I need this person needs
to be loyal to me and stay for three
years and you know, all that stuff. It's
like no. You've been doing this since
 
of fractional people? So how do you tell
good versus not? So we used to call it
interim because it didn't back to your
point of like is it a fraction or is it
a whole right because the fraction could
be 1.2x of their time.
&gt;&gt; They mean different things inter
&gt;&gt; right right so we think more interim.
The way that we used to think about it
before was like it was to Nolan's point
kind of like someone's not there so
maternity backfill or someone quickly
resigned or had a health issue and we
would plug someone in. The market has
gotten better. I don't have to lecture
them which I'm sure no one loved but I
think the modular consulting starts is
going to remain true and important in
the future of work. Meaning what problem
are we solving? Nolan what skills might
we need? Maybe it's 40 hours a week of
this person. Maybe it's 30 hours a week
of this skill set. and just thinking
more like that modular and experiments.
That's kind of more of the direction
that we advise both candidates and
clients.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. When somebody comes to you and
they're like, "Hey, I really want to do
fractional work." What do you tell those
people? What's your advice to them?
&gt;&gt; I basically say until I have a real gig
to talk to you about, like, let's just
put a pin in this. When I have a client
need that fits something that matters to
you. So, what I ask them is what are the
things that matter to you? Is it the
CEO? Is it the culture? Is it your
commute? Is it the number of hours? like
is it your pay? It can't be all of it.
Like real estate. If we see a project
that meets several of these, we'll give
you a call and then we'll diagnose
quickly as to whether this person is
going to work in this scenario because
there's too many scenarios.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Here's a real question. I hear
everyone bitching all the time. I sent
my stuff in. I had a great chat with
Nolan or Sally or Third Bridge or
whoever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. I didn't hear from
him again. What the hell is happening
here? Does it really go into a black
hole or are they just not great? Like
what happens? No, there's just more.
Back to Nolan's point, there's more
supply than demand.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Your your eye is definitely on them.
It's just
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, they're in the database.
Is my eye on We have 10,000 people in
the database. No, mine.
&gt;&gt; Exactly, Sally. Like, people don't get
that. Like, Kelly, this is actually the
problem with this model. It's a huge
problem for us, which is executives are
used to this white glove executive
search experience.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But in the business that Sally is
in, it's like you're a number. For
people who don't have experience, you're
probably never going to call them
because your list is so goddamn long of
people who you've already worked with
who have done great work. And so only if
they're solving a very specific niche
problem will you pick up the phone and
call them. Isn't that the honest to god
truth?
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And to Nolan's point, anyone
who's already worked with us is always
the first call. if they're busy or not
the right fit, we go to the second rung.
So, it's like anything else, right? Like
it's you go with your trusted people
first and the people who come in, we
need them because some of those other
people have retired, they've made their
FU money, you know, like it's a constant
like we care about getting new talent
for sure, but we just can't meet with
them all until we have a live project.
This is brilliant because I didn't ask
the question to tee this up because I am
just not that smart today. But this is
perfect because it does tee up the exact
point I want to make which we've talked
about so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] times Nolan is you
cannot rely on other people or companies
or platforms to get you stuff and
network for you and get like like we've
had lunch. I can help you because of the
leg work I did myself to network and
then that has other great effects and
this and that. Side note, if you want to
get time with Sally, buy her lunch.
maybe a martini one, but that nothing
replaces that. And so when I have
friends that call and complain about
this black holeness,
it's like you can sit around and
complain about this or you can actually
do some leg work. And you know what I
mean?
&gt;&gt; Oh my god, Kelly. Like highlight that
bullet double underscore bold it like
that. It's so interesting
continuum which is kind of like the feed
empty feedback. I would describe it as
empty feet cuz we didn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
which is like, oh, like they never
called back. And it's like, well, like I
haven't seen you get a job recently, so
is that my fault, too?
&gt;&gt; I mean, to be honest, it's a gift to
them. Like, why would I call you if I
have nothing to say? Like, until there's
a market need that they could address,
it's just, you know, like friendship,
which I have wonderful friends. But
yeah, I just think I just view these
things as working in tandem with great
people and companies like you both have
and had versus you all working for me.
It's a big mindset difference that I
think
is really important.
&gt;&gt; Well, and to be honest, anyone who's
kind of a complainer like aren't our
people anyway? So,
&gt;&gt; well, to be honest, there's not a
business there.
&gt;&gt; You have to have some resilience. Like
this business, Andrea on my team, she
she's hilarious. She always talks about
like people's gota like really be able
to roll with it. I can't remember what
the term she uses, but like they have to
have some spine. They have to have some
resilience. And if they're like, "What
have you done for me lately?" Like
swipe. Yeah. Speaking of resilience, my
last question for you, Sally, is how
have you kept this up? Like this
treadmill of this work you've been doing
is almost 15 years and it's been through
all of it. And you said yourself you
were kind of in front of it at some
points getting tomatoes thrown at you at
TED talks. Like what's changed? Like how
have you evolved this over the years?
How do you keep up the relationships?
Like what are some of the secrets?
&gt;&gt; Running experiments like you know never
being too tied into one thing. So I've
done really cool work called work lab
where we design thinking that made works
better. I'm now doing some work with
Leslie Pllo at HBS around how do people
have the most fulfilling lives. Like for
me it's about like following my
northstar which is curiosity.
Incredibly smart people who are also
kind and generous. And if I'm in the
learning space with the right people,
like whatever emerges, we will find the
bottom line. And so far, that's
happened.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; I love that, Sally. This was a blast.
Thanks so much for educating us. And
also our audience, I think this is like
one of those honest conversations that
people haven't heard that they need to
hear. And so, I hope if you're listening
to this, like your biggest takeaway is
is like nobody's managing your career
except for you. Sally's here to help and
can serve as a little bit of like
auxiliary, but like she's not your agent
and agents for executives don't yet
exist.
&gt;&gt; It'll be really interesting to see where
all this fractional stuff goes or ends
or grows. I just don't know. So, thank
you so much, Sally. It was a joy.
Anytime we can laugh together, I'm in.
&gt;&gt; Same. Same. Thanks, Ally.
