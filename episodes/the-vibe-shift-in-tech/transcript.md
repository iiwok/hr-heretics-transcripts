what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment this one's
going to be on the vibe shift in Tech so
I'm gonna have our producer Nat play a
video for you all of Tik Tok Nat take it
away
whatever happened to those Day in the
Life working in Tech Vlogs it's because
we all got laid off honey I worked at
Spotify in 2019 it was my first job out
of college I was so so so excited like
it was my dream to move to New York City
and just like live that like Carrie
Bradshaw lifestyle and we got so many
amazing perks when I worked at Spotify
we got free food um free breakfast lunch
and sometimes we would get dinner too we
would get free concerts we would get
free international trips to Sweden there
were just so many perks and now all
those perks have completely disappeared
not to mention I also got laid off from
my job but that's a story for another
day and that wasn't the only layoff I
had I also worked at Uber right after
Spotify as a marketing manager and I got
laid off from that job too as someone
who studied Engineering in college like
I went to like one of the best schools
for engineering like I was the only
woman women who graduated in my class
like I expected more out of my life like
I thought I would be like you know
making 300K at this point and a
full-time job with like a lot of
benefits but for a lot of my friends
this is not the case anymore you do not
want to work in Tech actually because
you are probably going to have your job
replaced by AI or replaced by something
down the line because now all they want
to do is just cut on cost but yeah the
tech industry is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and I just don't think anyone should
join Tech right now all right Kelly so
you know summarizing the video uh a few
years ago we had all these Tik toks of
free lunches and
sunbathing uh you know at lunchtime and
getting massages while you're at work
and now in
Tech all of those things have changed
right we've gone through this huge
playoff wave this huge cus cotting wave
what's your thoughts yeah I mean can we
just PA sunbathing during lunch what is
this there was that video of the product
managers at meta who were working by the
pool okay sorry yes yes I forgot no
one's younger than me he watches videos
all tell I wasn't aware of this
interesting interesting uh yeah look I
mean I I don't what do you think I've
heard I I've heard more in the last two
years the phrase I hate te but I have
have in like the last 10 years from
friends and colleagues in
Tech uh and I just what what is this
because I do think something's shifting
out there um I don't know if it's if
it's burnout if it's this but folks are
kind of kind of crapping over the
industry more recently it's funny
because it's correlated with kind of
this macro shift and I guess in my mind
it's correlated when things got hard
right and it wasn't it wasn't kind of
fun in games anymore and it became
frankly Less Fun and so when things
become harder and less
fun and you don't like them you tend
right now to do them or not like them
less right it kind of shows who really
loves it and and who was kind of doing
it for you know the reasons that make
sense the the financials the exits the
this and that that's all shifted so yeah
I the video was interesting and I've
seen it a lot look I think it's a
classic case of expectation
setting and look if you looked if you
were on the outside looking in at Tech
in
 
Internship movie right I was at Google
when that movie came out and it was an
accurate reflection of what was
happening every day and I it's so funny
we did not talk about this before this
but I was just thinking about that movie
in my mind we were just mind meling it
was reflection right it happened yes
those things happened like the reason
why they're funny is because they were
true hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors

playful. comom Heretics and so you you
have this generation especially that's
coming up and you know maybe they're a
couple of years out of school and this
has been the thing that has been fed
into their brain of how it actually is
and and then the other thing is we tend
to look at the the grid
riness with this rosec colored lens so
when we say apple was founded in a
garage and Google was founded in a
garage you know we we're not thinking
like it's poorly lit there's like rats
in the corner it's kind of like oh
there's this really cool Vibe going on
and we're going to build a billion
dollar
company and I just think what we're
going back to now is silicon Valley's
roots and Tech's Roots like it is a
gritty place these are gritty people the
thing with tech that is true is that if
you look at many successful
entrepreneurs they tend to be
immigrants they they tend to be Grinders
who are putting in tons of time to bring
their re their their Vision into
reality and I I think this is
unfortunately a case to where our
society and where media has is laid out
a picture that is untrue that you know
Tech is this cushy job that pays super
well and increasingly well as time goes
on just because they've invented money
printers when what's actually happening
now is that reality is setting in it's
hard to build business especially in a
capitalist environment to where
competition will come for your profits
and so not only do you have this macro
change you have real competition
from all over the place and now
companies are getting serious about
building lasting businesses and so a lot
of these
perks that were you know frankly I think
widely heralded are going away and the
real real time is
back yeah and I mean there's been you
know there's a lot of young people in
Tech right earlier Generations first job
second job and
because of the the long chain of great
times and Tech you know largely those
movies they were true for
them right this is this is arguably the
the first time in many folks' careers in
Tech where it's been not fun right it it
has not been easy for kind of the first
time and you saw that video almost like
an entitl it or expectation that I'm
going to be safe fat happy make a bunch
of money maybe not have to work super
hard and this this truth is hitting for
the first time for a lot of
people um and I think that you know I
empathize because it's like what what
just happened here right that it's not
easy it's not a fun thing they got rug
pulled very much rug pool so I'm not
coming down because it's hard I do
empathize but I think everyone a lot of
people are going through the transition
and I feel like if you actually don't
like it if it's it's not something that
you get energy from and that you wake up
and want to do it you're not going to
want to do it when it's not fun fat
happy and easy so I I do think it's it's
accelerating a lot of these people
actually out of
tech um which I don't necessarily think
is a bad
thing
right it's a good question I think it's
a it's a really good point that
 
if you could survive this
period Then you really want to be
here and you really want to be part of
building the
future yeah yeah and other guests have
said it right this this will create
better leaders I had colleagues that
were my house last week and we were
talking about this this this will create
more responsible individual contributors
this will create yeah you know humans a
talent it doesn't matter what level or
what role I think the mindset going to
be
better coming out of this uh and maybe
the pool of folks is less because a lot
of folks will exit Tech and whatnot
which is fine but I think what I'm
saying is I think the next chapter will
have a more
reasonable kind of of mindset than I
guess the last 10 years yeah my my High
School baseball coach used to say
adversity breeds
character and I think that's the moment
we're in right now is that we are
dealing with a lot of adversity it's
been brutal for the last almost three
years now in Tech yes and if you're
still here and if you are still
surviving and if you're still in the
game this will make you better this time
period will make you a better leader it
will make you a better IC you will
understand how to deal with hard times
it's just we're living in this moment
right now and we've we've Ben rug pulled
like especially this younger generation
the expectations have shifted
dramatically underneath their feet and
as much as I empathize with them you
know as as uh Jensen hang said who's the
CEO of
Nvidia when he said I wish you pain and
suffering what he was really getting at
is that that pain and suffering will
ultimately lead you to be a better
version of yourself it will you will be
able to deal with a lot more than you
currently think that you can and a lot
of these PR IES these perks that big
Tech had I think made us a little bit
soft and removing that softness is a bit
painful but on the other side of it is
going to be much better yeah people and
that's what I'm most excited about yeah
I think I think there will be better
better teams out of this better
execution better focus better
perspective right and and not taking
things for
granted um and and running running again
more responsible businesses uh I think
it got a little a little little unwieldy
out there for for a while uh yep yeah so
the vibe shift is on yeah uh but we'll
see I think we're towards this I think
we're about to reach stasis it does feel
like stasis is starting to to get
reached and the new expectations I think
appear pretty clear to everybody who's
currently in the game so let us know
what you guys think um so grateful for
your listeners ship Kelly it's almost
been a year can you believe that that's
crazy I can't believe
that so I can't believe it's it's been a
year yeah hasn't fired us yet really
thanks Eric for keeping us around thanks
but but most importantly thank you all

haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
