what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment today Kelly
and I are joined by a special guest and
friend of the Pod Colleen mccre it looks
like Kelly and Colleen are together in
some undisclosed location would you guys
like to opine and give us some uh some
insight into where you are we can't
disclose no no uh Colleen will let you
know I will tell you we had no idea we
were going to be here together until
about a week ago and I was like oh my
gosh this is incredible and I haven't
been here in years and years so tell the
audience where we're where are you we
are in Beverly Hills WooHoo for for
those of us old enough to remember or
watch you know Hulu or Netflix the home
of 902 and0 we are
at uh we are at the L
conference um which is a conference for
chief people
officers uh and it it it's it's pretty
awesome it's great we're sharing some
stories about a 100 people and I sent
coling a GI me of Beverly Hills 902 and0
last week so let's kick off yeah let's
all right I love I love that and just a
quick note is that that was my mom's
favorite show so um all right so let's
jump into this so Colleen sent Kelly and
I a text like a day or two ago and was
like oh my God have you guys seen this
Mr Beast document and so just some
context for the audience so there was a
a document leaked from Mr Beast
Productions Mr Beast is maybe the
biggest YouTuber in the world and the
document is titled how to succeed in Mr
Beast production so let me just describe
what it is it's 36 pages of what I would
describe as expectations of employees he
requires every single person to read it
it mentions many of his top employees
and their behaviors and he gives this to
people uh when they join the company and
everyone has to just go through this
process and read this long long document
so I'm going to read a couple lines from
this um one is around a players and this
is a direct quote you're either an a
player B player or C player there's only
room in this company for a players b
players are new people that need to be
trained into a players and C C players
are just average employees C players are
poisonous and should be transitioned to
a different company immediately and
immediately is in all caps and then he
goes it's okay we give everyone
Severance they'll be fine there's
another section called own your mistakes
where he says I hate excuses and I
despise with my entire soul when people
just try to save face instead of learn
from how they messed up mistakes were
okay genuinely they are and I expect you
to make a lot it's perfectly fine every
veteran here has C me a million dollars
at one point or another and you can go
ask them yourself if I ever held it over
their heads the reason I'm okay with
fuckups is because I know that's how you
learn I see it as me investing in you
and your brain um he goes on to talk
about many other topics including
ruthlessly prioritizing not taking no
for an answer so pushing through no
specifically like in CES process or
getting people to do things as videos
working on multiple videos
simultaneously
being honest so he expect employees to
be honest instead of being nice and then
every employee should be prepared to
pull all nighters pretty frequently so
the critics of this document are saying
he's pushing people too hard he's
playing favorites by naming uh his
favorite employees in the document and
that overall he comes off as an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
so Colleen mccre let's start with you
what is your take on this document I
actually loved this stuck I thought it
was great I mean first of all if we want
to go softer BR Brown who I do adore
who's the opposite of this in many ways
she has a famous statement that says
clear as kind I don't think you could
get any more clear about what it is like
to work at Mr Beast Productions outside
of this 36 pages I mean he is
exceptionally clear about what it takes
to work there what it takes to get
promoted what it takes to be successful
how to make a great video I mean he he
sort of lays it all out there so now and
by the way if you were choosing to work
at Mr Beast Productions you should
already know all of this because any of
his videos anything about working there
all of this is out I mean I have an
 
many of these things I have seen all
this so
demographically you should you should
all already be well aware of signing up
for this sort of world
but I actually think it's great I mean I
I I love people who are very clear about
what it's like to work at their company
I think it's phenomenal yeah my son's
also watch Mr Beast they're 13 so I'm
well
aware you know some reactions I had and
I love both of your takes is one you
know this reminded me of the base camp
document Nolan when you and I talked to
dhh and it was very very detailed and I
I appreciated that because I think this
went to a different level of detail it
was very simple and a lot of the
documents they can be very kind of you
know interesting words hard to
understand the way this is written I
could understand it as a 15-year-old you
know like in high school I can
understand it and I think that's how
some of these companies kind of scale in
a weird way because the game of
telephone gets really rough and not
everyone's kind of understanding
together and so it was written in a way
where it was very easy to understand
which I thought was really helpful you
know and it kind of pulls out the
excuses there's no black or white this
is it Etc the thing that I also thought
and I'd love your reactions the calling
out of names in the document to to
favoritism Etc I don't think I agree
with that I feel like if there are
examples or people that you might want
to talk to get guidance from get
mentorship from that have been
successful in this environment Go Seek
them out and so I think for me that's
acceleration of onboarding maybe that
changes over time who those names are
but how is the bar raiser program
different yeah how how are Awards
programs or we talk about star or the
when you tell stories on stage of some
and so was the Green Beret who saved the
day I don't understand how that's any
different everyone wants a bar raiser
program where it's the top 10 5% 10% and
everyone knows their names and they they
have a lot of say a lot of power they're
on a pedestal for a reason and didn't
see this as very as much different so I
had that reaction I drew those things
together yep look I mean I think the
critics are coming from a place to where
they're projecting what they would
prefer in working conditions onto
everyone else and I I see this all the
time on LinkedIn this is like the
prevailing LinkedIn culture is this is
the way work should be and it turns out
that every company is different every
company has its own Norms has its own
behaviors has its own expectations of
what greatness looks like and you know
I'm with you guys like what we love
about this is It's hyper clear Kelly to
your point around the language he uses
this is how he talks so many of these
documents ends up in this like corporate
mumbo jumbo that ran through like 10
layers of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legal and comms and
then you get this Dock and the founder
looks like at and they so worn down from
getting beat up by these people about
what they put they're like ah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they
just send it whatever and it's actually
not representative of what working at
the company is like and I think he's
he's completely nailed it for him and
that's what we keep talking about on the
show is as long as you are hyper clear
about what it's actually like thank you
like you have done the world a service
because now I'm going to use my favorite
line it's going to serve serve as a
magnet for the people we want to attract
or a repellent for the people we want to
avoid and I honestly can't expect
anything else I can't project my wants
my desires my sorts of working
conditions onto him all I can do is try
and figure that out through an interview
process which at most places is
absolutely terrible it's so performative
I don't know really what the hell is
going on in there and then I show up and
I'm like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I didn't realize like
this is what was actually going on
underneath the surface so our takeaway
for everyone listening is you may not
agree with everything in there and
that's great that's awesome at least you
know

Heretics Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting teams
efficiency and quality use metav view
metav view is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at highper pering
organizations like brex hellofresh and
Flora and check out medavie head over to
metav vi. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
metav View's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled in minutes well and my my
hunch on this is that he hired a bunch
of people and then someone really burned
him and my Su my suspicion it was
somebody from like Netflix or YouTube or
or some traditional production company
because there's this whole paragraph of
like I really don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what
happened at whatever X
company that does not matter none of
that what you've done before will matter
here in terms of success on terms of how
we make videos and what we do here like
it really reminded me of like he had hit
a level of like I am just going to sit
down and I going to write out everything
it takes to be successful here because
I'm so tired of having people come in
here and thinking they know better and
it's just going to be easier if I just
you know am this clear with you and I'm
gonna sit down and write it all out
which is frankly not that different than
like Claire Hughes Johnson in her book
about leading teams where she talks
about she has a guide to working with
Claire where that she gives out to
everybody like you know I'm sure hers is
written in beautifully I mean she's such
a wonderful human but I'm sure it's like
well are articulated and beautifully
written and probably you know the
grammar is much better and it's you know
well formatted and it's probably if
you're my direct report versus if you
are my manager versus if you are two
layers down or whatever but like this
was probably very much like some Friday
night where he was just like I'm done
this is where I'm at and I'm gonna write
it all there and this is it but it would
serve a lot of us well like I worked
with this guy at my last at the you know
investment firm I was at and I called
him a Tootsie Roll pop because he was so
crunchy and so hard to deal with but
actually once you finally got to know
him he was like soft and gooey on the
inside and I actually just dropped off a
bag of Tootsie Roll pops to him and I I
just said like dude just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] write a
document for everybody with all your
rules and little things that irk you and
bother you and then we'd all know better
and then everyone would then you'd be
happier and we'd be happier and then no
one has this like ew I don't want to
work with him anymore like actually does
everybody a service if you write this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
down why is this so bad I don't
understand why people are having such a
huge reaction the other I will say the
other thing I did have reaction to was
if I was an HR person at Mr Beast
Productions which I would never do but
if I were he makes a bunch of promises
in there that I have learned from past
experiences that you should probably
never do about making money and how much
money you could make and you could be so
successful and blah blah blah blah blah
might coach somebody to not make those
kinds of promises but in theory he's
probably right he does probably want to
he aspires to do these things for people
so good on him kick ass I want to give
it all away I wanna I want to make you
all awesome to your point about being
burned and then writing this one night
in response Nolan before we started
recording I I that was my biggest
question for this this segment was how
did why did this happen now because Mr
Beast is not new no he's running all
he's running four companies right now he
thinks he's GNA be running eight soon
blah blah blah blah blah yes so so how
did this come about and why don't all
companies do this yeah right and and my
assumption was that something happened
we talked about this the other day with
policies right they're usually reactive
to something so what what was the
impetus on this and why don't more
companies do it it's a very hard
exercise I mean 36 pages to dissect what
you're about it's not something you'd
probably enjoy doing maybe maybe you
would but that was my biggest question
was what what what inspired this and
should we all be doing it so yeah so
just to to Colleen's Point around you
know he probably got burned and then
like you know in the the heat of the
night just like opened his laptop and
started typing I've done that you know
who else has done that Abraham Lincoln
did that he wrote letters J
M Jerry McGuire did it yeah yeah Lincoln
didn't send his usually um but look I
mean I I always say this I I had a
manager at Google who was absolutely
terrible and then I've had a string of
just incredible managers and I learn
more from that terrible manager than I
learned from the good ones because it's
just this is what I don't want and
Clarity on sometimes on what you don't
want is actually better than what you do
want you know it's it's sometimes it's
easier for you to articulate so I'll say
that on that point and then the other
one you know and this is I think a trend
that's been happening now for maybe the
last 24 to to 36 months but the the the
underlying thing in this document the
best part about it is it's authentic
it's super real and it's rough around
it's Jimmy it's Mr Beast like when I
read this document I hear him talking to
me and I think authenticity at this sort
of a level in this sort of like I'm
going to just bear my soul to my
team is coming back in a big way and I
think is going to be a big part of the
future if you do want to win the best
talent you got to build deep
relationships with people and this whole
like facade [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I put on my suit
and I change personalities when I walk
out of the door kind of like like what
happened in a generation or two ago
those days are over for the best talent
the best talent wants real relationships
especially with their CEO and they want
to know who they're working for and they
want to know what they're going to war
for every day and I love that about this
yeah I was going to say they want they
definitely want to know who they are and
if they believe them or not it's a huge
differentiator I mean that this document
is not something you can write with AI
as an example we were just in a session
about AI this is not an AI written
document in fact it's kind of a good
reminder I'd like to sit down piece of
white paper and just go I'm not sure I
ever did that to that level of detail
I'm sure it's more difficult than we
might imagine yeah I think it's I mean
it's interesting because um I'm starting
a new job with a new team and I wrote
down like here are sort of my
philosophies or here are some of my
things and and it's helpful to you know
be a writer in general like I like to
write a lot but it was really helpful
because someone that used to work for me
had written them all down and had given
them to me as a gift like here Colleen
isms
and I was like oh was so nice to have
those now to be like oh these are the
things that I preach on a regular basis
that they've heard and I was like oh
these are so good like oh these are
really really good I'm so glad I have
them but I also also have that habit
already because I can be mean and I I
want people to not think I'm so mean and
so I already had that habit of like hey
this is the like Claire this is the
introduction to me like this is how I
work best this is how I operate best
these are the this is the ins and outs
of working with me and even in this new
job you're Tootsie Roll too I'm a bit of
a tits roll too this is why I recognize
those people titsy Roll Pop Pop um but I
think it's just such a good practice but
to that note of authenticity I started a
new job and the comms team had like
written this thing for me to send and I
was like hi you let me introduce myself
I have two rules I won't lie and I have
to write my own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and so I like have
now Rewritten I've been there a week
I've already Rewritten like three things
like sorry oh my God I love that I love
that so much wonderful I can't I I just
won't and actually the CEO was like
thank you he just it it it turns out
that like it gets rewarded and kind and
look it's it's you know like I said
earlier about um you know it serves as a
magnet for the people that we want and a
repellent for the people people that we
want to you know to to not get near us I
I just I think authenticity is in short
supply in today's world we all have this
like facade on us I mean Kelly and I did
a segment the other day where I talked
about I got feedback about being a robot
from a direct report and he was totally
right I had this like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] facade on
and I think that's what we learn in
school that's what we're we're
projecting of like what is what's the
corporate world actually like it's like
oh I like you know I just I come out of
my door I come is like the business
person it's like no you be who you are
and as we look forward and as we look
into the future I I truly believe this
is the behavior that's going to be
rewarded now I still I still not want to
work for Mr Beast Productions let's be
clear correct like I still and I don't
you know I don't think LinkedIn does a
great job of creating space for lots of
different workplaces I think you are
 
let's just be Who We Are
and let the world decide yeah I mean the
point of this show isn't to take posture
you know what I mean I don't think I
agree with everything in Mr Beast
document that's not the point though the
point is to talk about all the Angles
and the clarity of what this is and what
it serves for everyone to have that in
their consideration set that's the whole
point of these shows is not to take
position yeah it's it's a really it's a
really fine point Kelly because you're
totally right that you you know we're
not talk what we haven't opined on is
actually like how do I think about that
thing and like does that like I don't
care I just love Clarity like I and I
think that that's what we owe employees
if you are a business owner founder CEO
or an executive your job is to bring
Clarity that's one of your primary jobs
and I think the thing that drives me
absolutely crazy is when we rug pull
people or we sell a bill of goods that
isn't true
like that violates moral principles I
think in all of us as humans and so
whether or not you agree with him you do
have to applaud him for being very
clear amen so this was a blast team I
love you guys have fun in Beverly Hills
hopefully you guys don't end up on some
like Candy Camera today and uh thanks so
much for making this happen yeah awesome
