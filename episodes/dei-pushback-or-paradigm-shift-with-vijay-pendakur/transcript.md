# DEI: Pushback or Paradigm Shift? With Vijay Pendakur

## Transcript

all right everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we have V pendor on the
show now v a mutual friend introduced us
on a comment thread on LinkedIn tell us
about how you ended up in in the Dei
space and some of the you've done sure
that's just such a 2024 you know intro
right like we we met on a comment thread
on
LinkedIn at some point in time we have
we have to meet in 3D in order to fix
this so little bit about me background
I've been in I started in Dei work in
 
career I started in this work in higher
education and worked at five
universities ending my time as Adena
students and presidential adviser for
diversity at Cornell and then I moved
into corporate work and held senior HR
roles focused on talent and culture at
um Zinga and VMware and Dropbox and
Salesforce and then I moved into my own
solopreneurship consultancy fractional
work around kind of core issues in
employee experience and I focus on
keynote speaking and team Effectiveness
coaching High performing teams work
mostly these days and so today is August
 
middle of a very interesting moment for
the Dei space there's there's
significant push back that we're feeling
on all ends of the spectrum from
political leaders to Tech leaders to I
mean you know you go on Twitter which is
one of the most toxic places on Earth
and some of these comment threads there
I think are significantly worse than the
one that un are on in LinkedIn now it
seems that after a decade of significant
investment billions of dollars in annual
investment tech tech teams are now
cutting Dei colleges are abandoning
abandoning D mission statements and
we're seeing just this push back
everywhere including in DC we also
recently saw that Sherm which is one of
the the biggest HR professional groups
in the space recently removed the term
Equity from Dei what's your take on all
of this well let's start with the light
stuff huh so you know I I love this
question and I think for me there's
there's so much bundled into this
question Kelly Nolan that one of the
things I think is helpful here is really
go to go micro to macro and I want to
clean up some of the signal versus the
noise right because part of the
challenge in having a coherent
discussion on anything that touches Dei
in this moment in time is that the the
signal Fidelity is terrible right so
let's look at where there's signal and
where there's noise I think that the the
framing of billions of dollars and and a
decade of investment could be more
accurately tightened up to wavering
investment depending on sector maybe
going back 10 years right so some
organizations if you think about 2013
leanin comes out you know CH samberg's
book and particularly in Silicon Valley
there was a moment right and when you
look at the adoption and and the
organizations that leaned in to be
tongue and cheek about it we're we're
really talking about very disperate
levels right of of who cared frankly
this moment and then you see this
inflection point in 2020 I think in
terms of spend I haven't seen the
receipts on the billions but I I do
think a lot of money has been spent
particularly in Tech and so I think a
tighter signal is in two and a half
years between 2020 and halfway maybe
close to 2023 Tech got really interested
in spending money in Dei before pulling
back heavily on Dei and and so and I
think it's important to frame the time
commitment because what it does is it
sort of focuses the conversation on how
much time does it take to address
systemic
unfairness when corporations are really
Downstream of the thing they're trying
to intervene in right so Dei we talk
about it in terms of workplace mechanics
but really it's it's it's a complex set
of variables and corporations who are
trying to look at hiring employee
experience social impact they're
Downstream of a bunch of social forces
that took hundreds of years to create
and perpetuate and maintain and so when
we say like hey look corporations spent
two and a half years and hundreds of
millions of dollars you know what do you
think about that I'm like great we're
just getting started is one way of
framing this and I know that that's
dissonant with where the popular
conversation is now but you I think it's
really important to ground this
historically if we're talking about
intervening in systemic unfairness then
how many years is reasonable I think is
a is a fair question to ask you also
mentioned that this is sort of a multis
sector configuration we're in right now
when people talk about colleges or
higher education pulling back on Dei
this is near and dear to my heart as you
know somebody who worked as a social
scientist and a higher education
administrator for almost 20 years I
think also s clean signal here colleges
and universities in Republican dominated
states that have passed anti-de
legislation are complying with the laws
in those States and therefore ending
certain kinds of Dei programs similarly
colleges and universities are complying
with um an affirmative action ruling
from the Supreme Court but I think the
framing of the question is hey look
there's this big higher red roll back on
Dei misses the fact that there's an
exogenous Force here creating the the
shift in Dei commitment the the trend
line for 15 20 years in higher education
has been steady investment in Dei
because demographics are Destiny they
they University that and colleges that
decide that they want to step back from
this are just facing a relevance crisis
because the future pipeline of who's
going into higher education is
increasingly female lowincome first gen
International like you name it right
veteran adult learner non-traditional
and so continuing to index on a certain
type of student from the 20th century is
just a bad it's bad business in higher
education and so I think again like
noting that there's external forces
really driving a lot of this and I've
and I've been burning through the back
catalog of HR you know Heretics and I
love this podcast but I do think a lot
of times the Dei conversation has been
happening in a bit of a vacuum and what
I want to do is try and expand our
aperture to include the fact that and
the Sherm mess is such a great example
of this right that and because you asked
about it right what is sherm actually
responding to here how could one of the
most canonical organizations in HR pull
away from equity and and a lot of what's
happening is sherm as a federal
contractor Sherm is trying to uh
anticipate what might happen in the
bigger sort of political milu they're
stepping back in in an attempt to
respond to an active campaign you know
led by really well-funded think tanks
the Heritage Foundation folks on Twitter
which I agree is a dumpster fire most of
the time but if you look at Chris rufo
or Steven Miller or any of these guys
threads on Twitter they're very
transparent about what they're doing
here which is let's take anything
connected to Dei and load the signal
with so much noise that no one can have
a coherent conversation about this
anymore and so that you know you're at
your neighborhood barbecue you bring up
something like inclusion and people say
is that that Reverse Racism thing or you
bring up ESG and somebody's like is that
woke capitalism and you're like where is
all this coming from it's a pretty
concerted effort to make it really hard
to get into some Nuance get into some
context and be tactical with with what
is really really hard work to Edge
organizations towards being meritocratic
I mean mean Sherm's abandonment of of
equity is is bananas to me because
Equity is simply the process of moving
towards meritocracy without Equity you
can't have meritocracy and you all have
done a great job of kind of wrestling
with this over the the last six eight
weeks particularly since Alex's post but
you know I think that Sherm really let
the HR Community down in deciding to
back away from courageous leadership
there was a chance here to double down
and say let's just get clarity on what
Equity is it's a data driven
process-based way to advance meritocracy
in complex organizations and that's an
easily defensible definition but they
didn't do that hey everyone we'll be

Heretics here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vio zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive
accessible and mobile First Tool people
actually like using it which is why why
companies like ryion a Dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shoutouts and live streams among
other features help Elevate the employee
experience like never before the result
dramatically better retention
productivity and most importantly
connectedness a greater sense of the
belonging we all crave at work whether
we sit at a desk or drive a truck
make work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics
 
say I I I I do I mean the way that you
just described it I I do believe is an
easily defensible position I think the
the challenge is it started with
equality and then it moved into equity
and the definition of equity as you
describe it is not widely shared amongst
the community and so my understanding as
the broad definition of equity is we all
start from different places and so what
we need to do is we need to look back at
where we started and try and lift people
up who started at a place that was
lower and the mean mechanics of doing
that I think what we're starting to see
with with businesses with Sherm even
specifically I do think a lot of it is
is monetary motivated to be very clear
but I don't know how you actually take
those mechanics and operationalize them
if you're a tech company for example I
don't know how you operationalize it
without hampering other folks apparently
potentially from a different gender or
race and put an a weight on their ankle
and I think I think that's where the
discussion is today and so when I hear
you say you know the removal of equity
as
bananas what I what I hear on my side is
like well it's actually very hard to
operationalize and didn't we start with
equality and shouldn't equality be the
thing that we're focused on I I mean I
think that we so there's some semantics
here right and and that's that's fine I
think that let me clarify what I mean by
Equity right so when I think about
Equitable process in the HR space right
if we look at segments of the employee
life cycle and you when you're looking
at unfair or asymmetric friction that
certain groups face Equity a datadriven
equity approach is to look at whether an
organization has asym asymmetric
headwinds that face certain groups
inside that organization and then to use
data and practice to address those
headwinds so it's a there's a Nuance
difference here because what you talked
about was adding Tailwinds right how do
we put our finger on the scale and help
certain groups I think that that's
become extremely litigious and risky for
for
for-profit companies right now but
there's actually an immense amount of
work to do and this is actually in the
comments thread that right that brought
us together Nolan on on LinkedIn there's
so much work you can do with Equity
overlays in your employee life cycle
just to understand promotion velocity
exit rates for women at director plus
Equity overlays on your funnel mechanics
right this you're an expert ta we know
that passive rates and funnels are often
reflective of bias and noise in our
practice right and that an equity
process is for an early stage
organization to move from unstructured
interviewing to structured interviewing
very basic right that's an equity
investment because what it does is it
removes unfair headwinds for from people
who are negatively affected by
unstructured interviewing right and the
ways in which Affinity bias and you know
social netw Recreation creep into the
funnel if you don't have structured
interviewing right so like I think some
of this is just around semantics there's
a ton of good work to do in
organizations that's perfectly legally
defensible that is actually about
fairness Equity as a driver of fairness
because right now life isn't actually
Fair no matter what people want to say
it's not fair in organizations right
there are still tons of points where we
inside you know the War Room Kelly
you've been CPO many many times when
you're looking at employee data you know
that there are trends that seem to
signal that there's some unfair
treatment happening here or that on our
on our sales teams there are a certain
amount of sales teams where it's not
great to be a woman above L4 you know or
whatever it might be addressing those
asymmetric frictions is equity look I
think yeah look Dei there's I think it's
very easy to get confused right
generalize what these things mean and
actually apply them wrongly right I mean
you can kind of understand it think
you're doing things that are causing
equity and it's not really accurate
right so if we look at Equity providing
the same resources and opportunities to
everyone right if I look at in a
positive light if I if I look at it from
the offensive not making sure we're not
doing something but making sure we're
doing the same thing for everybody
doesn't matter what like I just I go
back to like very simple lenses it's
very easy to again generalize
misunderstand confuse these terms and
I've seen HR people actually do things
the organizations that are making it
worse or not not making sure that
everyone independent of you know gen has
the same resources opportunities from an
equity perspective so I think if we keep
this simple to your pointal I don't
think it should ankle weight anyone it
should remove weights from everyone you
know and so I don't know I just I just I
don't know why they would remove this I
mean sh was a you know the bottom of the
list in my mind anyway and this just
made it worse but it's it's again this
this misunderstanding of what these
things are and we muck it all up in my
opinion so so I I hear I hear it sounds
like in this group we have alignment and
and that doesn't surprise me but what
I'm not hearing is the other side
represented which I I tried to represent
which is you know V you use the term
semantics I actually would use the term
details and this is when we start to get
into the details and
so you know what what I am increasingly
hearing is not about a uh Fair
meritocratic standard process that
everyone goes through regardless of race
gender religious belief political
affiliation whatever it is that's not
what I'm hearing what I'm hearing is is
there's a group of people specifically
around race and gender that have started
at a much more difficult place than
another group of people from a specific
race and gender and we need to do more
for them in order to help them that is
what is increasing in the conversation
today and so correct me if I'm wrong but
that's what I'm hearing a lot more of
yeah I think you know I think that in
when I was getting my thoughts together
for our conversation today I think one
of the things that I'm wrestling with
right so you know just to name like that
I'm still working through the mechanics
of this myself is there's a there's a
corporate tactical conversation that is
that should be very much around you know
bodies of practice evidence-based you
know Investments what's legal obviously
always right and then there's a broader
conversation about what are we going to
put our finger on the scale of in our
society right and I think where the the
data streams get mixed is if we want to
have a social justice conversation I'll
give you a different definition of
equity because when it's about repairing
restoring and responding to structured
exclusion that we could spend the next
week talking about right which is which
is inextricable from the fabric of
American History yeah at some point in
time you've got to figure out are we
going to Edge towards a fully inclusive
Multicultural democracy or not that's a
bigger
social conversation right corporations
are way Downstream of that conversation
and I think what happened in 2020 not in
 
and I'd love I mean you know you all are
both very in the valley right this is it
happened in Tech probably in a more
hyperbolic way than anywhere else is a
confusion as to whether we're talking
about like Dei for our society like the
promise of of an inclusive Democracy in
America what which does take a form of
equity that is about saying well what
are we going to do with the fact that
we're playing a game of Monopoly and
half the country didn't get to play for
the first 20 roles and then and then
people got feathered in in different
rates you know after that and you're
going to pretend like everybody can land
on Parkplace and buy it and it's not
true and so that's a social conversation
but in 2020 in in the in the kind of
Technicolor moment in the valley
especially I was a chief diversity
officer of a publicly held company on
its run to A1 billion market cap it was
a very exciting time and what I felt
inside the room facing the the comp
Committee of the board facing the SE
Suite was a sudden expansion of the
aperture around what the purpose of
corporate Dei was and half of our
conversations were actually about are we
doing enough good for society half the
conversations were about business Dei
right like build the road map you know
making sure that we've got the right
kpis in place what do we need to modify
in the text act to like you know scale
and automate some of the stuff what is
the right ERG playbook for our business
you know things like that product
inclusion that's but in 2020 and I would
say into 2021 there was still this
really vibrant discussion the board I
would i' would be sitting with the board
and they would be going how can this
company do more for society how much
money do we need to spend to expand the
total address Market of future talent
that we we we might not even hire these
folks right like and so I using a
significant amount of capital we built a
scholarship program in a university
without it's not like we eared that
Talent right that was simply a service
was a social impact program that was
considered part of the Dei playbook in
 
numerous headwinds macroeconomic
headwinds Supply shocks geopolitical but
also litigation headwinds dried up the
altruism side of De Dei and what was
left was sort of the business rationale
and I think Nolan we're humans don't do
well with Paradigm shifts right Thomas
kean's original research on this talks
about how when paradigms shift we
actually exist in the old Paradigm for a
long time even before you know like
behaviorally we just not good at change
we're in a new paradigm right now where
the social purpose form of Dei really is
quickly being scrubbed out of business
of profit businesses particularly
publicly held ones but the the discourse
hasn't adjusted yet and the Whiplash
that I don't feel is acknowledged on HR
Heretics enough is if you were an
operator in 2020 it feels like I'm on
Mars right now because of the types of
things we were talking about in 2020 in
a publicly held corporation which is is
it our duty to fix social ills you know
you've got remember Dustin moskovitz and
conscious capitalism Brian chesky's you
know what was it sh as shareholder you
know capitalism and there was so many
different sort of variants on this right
that conversation blipped out real quick
and I think that we're we let go of one
trapes bar we haven't grabbed the next
one yet in terms of where the discourse
is settling and I I know you've been
exploring
that hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
Real Talk most Talent leaders haven't
yet cracked how to leverage AI for
Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistance for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a time
saer because perfect notes means perfect
data for every candidate in every
pipeline hiring teams can make confident
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
pora and check out metaview head over to
metav view. a/h Heretics to talk to one
of metav VI's product experts or get
started for free you'll be up running an
AI enabled in
minutes and VJ I mean and recently I
totally agree with you so the societal
piece has been scrubbed out and now it
seems at least from the headlines that
the business piece is also being
scrubbed out with the cutting of all
these teams
so I i' love both of your take on
something that I've been trying to
reconcile and it's like I remember four
or five years ago right Dei leaders CEOs
of companies were saying and I still
believe this this work will never end
this work is systematic this work even
if 20 years make progress we have to go
deeper and there's new EV like it it
will never end and everyone was like we
will always do this this is important
and now it's like couple companies cut
it everyone's cutting it like please
reconcile that for me
because you know what I mean yeah you're
you're totally right Kelly and I I have
noticed that hilarious like if you just
look at it like a 5-year-old it's
it's it's it's disheartening to me that
everyone said such things with such
fierceness like we're committed forever
this andever and then boom can I offer
the spicy take on this that's that's why
we're here that's why we're here for
that's why we're here right so look and
I I don't have a I don't have a
conclusion here but where I am going
with this internally because yeah when
you look at it like a 5-year-old you're
sort of like wait but so were you lying
for years ago what does that mean I
actually don't think as individuals
people were necessarily lying I had some
very intensely visceral closed door
conversations with numerous seite
Executives of Fortune 500 companies that
were going through a transformation of
heart and mind around purpose around
understanding the weight of exclusion in
ways that they just hadn't felt before
the switch flipping off so quickly I
think calls to question whether
corporations are the right mechanism to
drive social restoration this is a scope
of care dialogue and actually this has
come up in some of your podcasts in the
last I'd say two months right what is in
scope for corporations to be dealing
with when it comes to employee
experience let alone Dei right because
if you're talking to a comp and Ben
person right now they're they're also
living in a bit of whiplash two three
years ago comp and Ben was rapidly
expanding right like to deal with almost
any part of your life especially in Tech
that you were upset with it's like hey
we've got a vendor we can add in more
resources we can keep Feathering in more
stuff and I think sometimes the cfo's
office was like this is so weird because
for 40 years we kept the benefits stack
really leaning and suddenly we're just
yes yes yes yes yes and the scope of
care of what a corporation was expected
to do during covid and I think covid was
a real calist here that we cannot
underrate right like we're talking about
social activism and Dei but covid
actually created perforations in some of
the walls around duty of care to your
employees that then also see into Dei
right what parts of the what parts of
the human experience are we going to own
and when Wall Street checked Tech
legitimacy a year and a half ago and
said look if you're if you're a SAS
company and you're nowhere near the rule
of 40 we're gonna start finally holding
you accountable to some business
fundamentals right then all of a sudden
it was like oh oh gosh okay well we've
got to drive margin and our top Line's
not growing and so we're just going to
compress sopex and what what died on The
Cutting Room floor in that calculus
between Top Line and bottom line is Oh
yeah that's that duty of care that's
that momentarily expanded just to talk
about like altruism and humanity and the
whole person and taking care you know
we're we're family we're not a workplace
and it's like I don't know I think we're
actually in a much more real moment
around what corporations exist to do
they are phenomenal mechanisms for
generating wealth our Society has to
find a way to get involved in
fixing these kinds of you know really
deeply entrenched social inequalities
and I think it trying to turn to the
private sector to address them it I
think what the last four years have
shown me is that it's too ephemeral the
commitment is is can disappear overnight
based on the market so we actually need
to lean on things that are more
longstanding I I I love that the J the
scope of care Nolan I I've never really
talked about it like that I've never
even in my 24 years in this in Dei and
companies we've never I've never really
had that explicit discussion you know
what what is our scope of care what are
our boundaries and this goes back to
what we've talked about a lot in Nolan
is is Clarity on who you are and what
you stand for and maybe the scope of
care is very wide for an organization
you know but J but I I think a lot of
times companies created their scope of
care based on what's going on outside
side of their walls versus being very
clear around who they are inside and how
that's going to look and I think that's
muddied the waters a lot and created a
lot of confusion and you know and I
think this we've seen this bounce back
and forth so I agree with with both of
you but I want to make sure that we have
empathy for the rest of the business as
well and one of my goals with this show
is is actually like we hear this all the
time Kelly from Chief people officers
like I want a seat at the table and I
think a big reason why we often don't
feel that way is because we make
challenges as they are from the HR team
bigger than the challenges of the rest
of the business so we've been talking
about this pendulum shift and this
Paradigm Shift well I mean if I said
this you know in today's show that
launched is think about the rest of the
business I mean they're dealing with
they're also dealing with the Wall
Street changes they're dealing with
budget cuts they're dealing with AI
they're dealing with layoffs too so I
think we do ourselves a disservice in HR
when we only Naval Gaye and we don't
include the other areas of the business
and we act like it's harder on us than
it is on them so I'll start there the
next thing I'll say is we have data can
I can I opine on what you just said and
point out because I you've done a good
job of being really consistent about
this right about saying like hey HR like
obviously this show comes from a place
of love you're both HR practitioners and
you're trying to do a good Jobing like
where is the whining not acceptable and
and I love that that's that's that's an
important accountability razor in
Balance I'll offer an example of what I
think is actually pretty singular and
exceptional and and please counter if
you if you disagree when when I've
watched organizations that I've been on
on the inside of get excited about Ai
and they've hired some sort of an AI Zar
or a machine learning or blockchains are
or anything web 3s are anything in the
last four or five years that was like
very zey very in the
that Zar was given wide birth to go to
all of the elements of the business and
go if we're going to crack blockchain we
need to change this this this and this
and people were told yeah okay I gotta
got to do
this the number of Chief diversity
officers you can bring on to your show
where the organization made did not fill
the soil at all to get ready for Dei
overnight was like oh we're gonna do
this let's go out and hire a person or
some people let's create some liquidity
a budget line and then the Dei person
came in and everyone including the chief
people officer was like so are you gonna
make this
work it don't work like that right so
then you go okay well fine I I need to
have a plan to address everything from
hiring you go to the head of ta hey we
need to make these kinds of changes and
slow down here until we get
compositional mix and top of funnel on
these kinds of key searches blah blah
and the head of ta goes
no I I'm with you I'm with with you but
that's a shared responsibility V right
that's a shared respons you it it
absolutely is a shared responsibility to
where if that person is interviewing and
they like CU here I I what I would
describe the way I would describe what
you're saying is a rug pull and if a rug
pull happens I'm fully with you but what
I think is more happening is these
professionals are coming in the job
sounds great but they haven't done their
diligence they haven't gotten to the
lowest level of detail in the interview
Tech to actually scenario play well when
this thing happens well what about when
the business pulls back what are we
going to do and again maybe there are
situations where that has been the case
I I don't believe that is what's
happening at a broad-based level the
other thing I would say and where I was
going is every aspect of the business
especially in today's world but just
historically is always under a
microscope for Roi and we look at data
you've been mentioning data a bunch in
this conversation I think that's very
healthy
that there has been investment there
have been people put on this problem and
then what ends up happening is is the
data doesn't move things don't change at
least that's what businesses are saying
right now and it this is it absolutely
reflected in the rest of the business is
when you bring in a new sales leader and
numbers either don't improve or go down
that person's going to get terminated
and I think that that's more of what's
Happening Here it I do think it's more
of brass facts of like well we haven't
seen change we thought we would make
this investment and things would be
better and that hasn't been the case
okay well let's I mean let's granular
eyesee this notion that things didn't
get better right so let's say rough math
about a third of Fortune 500 companies
publish some form of of transparent
demographic data and if you do a 10-year
look back or a five-year look back
depending on how long that data has been
available the trend line is up and to
the right for C what the kinds of
inclusion that they were going for so if
you look at you all are play heavily in
Tech but if you look at Salesforce you
look at Microsoft the trend line is up
and to the right there's there's major
double- digit gains of women's
representation across the organization
even at director Plus at VP plus
Microsoft you know industry leader in
this so there are examples of
improvement in the space there's you
know so so there's that that side of
things on the flip side though bring
some integrity and some data to this out
of the Fortune 1,000 companies less than
half have any VIs ility into their
demographic data so when people say
things haven't gotten better I'm I'm
interested in in what database they're
using to understand that lack of
progress because we are operating off of
anecdote frequently right if with no
data transparency it's very difficult to
tell whether things are getting better
or not and I do there there's huge
amount of the of of companies that just
don't report right who who's in what
roles and whether they've made progress
or not so this is difficult it's
difficult to get clean signal on this I
think that the question of whether
things got better or not is somewhat
based
on whether companies and so it's
interesting noan because partly what you
did in your last answer is you're like
look I think it's on the Dei leader
fault if the company commitment isn't
there because they didn't diligence the
role enough I'm not sure I think that
that's tough that's a tough sell because
there's the vast majority and this was
big in Tech especially Kelly I'd be
interested in your experience here the
vast majority of companies that pursued
any kind of Dei commitment in the last
let's say five years went heavy on
hiring way less focus on equity and
inclusion equity and inclusion came a
far second in terms of where the dollars
and the calories went and part of the
challenge around progress here is that
many companies had a revolving door
right of bringing people in and those
folks voting with their feet and going
this isn't a good experience I don't
want to be here I don't feel good on my
team or my team leader has no skill to
manage someone different than themselves
you know y y y right and so I think a
huge mistake is is tactical but it
doesn't obviate the philosophical
commitment to Dei like the mistakes and
tactics are found in every discipline
right I mean look at blockchain tons of
mistakes made do people use that to then
say well this whole thing is bunk or the
space race right there's many people do
say that about blockchain I I actually
think that that's absolutely that is
what a lot of people say is like when we
look at this and we look at the data of
how much investment went into blockchain
for example and the ROI on the
investment I think many people say that
for sure and now they're starting to say
it about AI so that's hilarious I agree
I it this this is my point is is it it
comes down to the the investment and the
ROI and and Jay just to to Steelman your
side you're exactly right that the
metrics have have moved in in some of
these larger companies the question is
is the impact on the business that's
very hard to measure that that is very
very hard to measure and so I think
that's the other side of this is like
some of it is unmeasurable now I will
say
anecdotally from an inclusive standpoint
i' I've told the story on the show
before like my mom when I was eight or
nine years old got fired for because I
had chicken box and she had to stay home
and and help me and so like I will say
that's not fully eradicated from society
but we have made significant gains as it
relates to like taking care of your
family carip those sorts of things and I
would also say we've made significant
gains in the way that we interact it is
imperfect humans are imperfect but I
believe we should always be striving for
improvement and especially as it relates
to inclusivity and how we interact with
each other where I get scared is this
overreliance on mutable traits and
metrics associated with IM mutable
traits that that does worry me because
when we're only focused on those things
that's where the scale tipping
conversation comes in and that's where a
lot of the conversation has gone in this
country I want to respond to this melli
I think you were trying to get in so if
you want to jump in and I'll go ahead go
ahead then I'll jump in v j two thoughts
one um I'm sorry to hear about what
happened when you were a kid and it is
glaring it's a it's a real like glaring
sign of how much has changed right
around Family Leave the kinds of Rights
employees have versus what our parents
went through my parents immigrated to
North America in the 1960s and and labor
conditions that my dad describes in the
 
Gestalt right the movement over time
towards increased dignity at work didn't
happen idiosyncratically it didn't
happen spontaneously it happened because
of social forces pushing for work to be
better and to treat people better so
just a PO reminder that nothing gets
better unless we put our finger on the
scale nothing right I mean like
organizations generally Don't Drift
towards Humanity they drift towards
margin so you know we've got to find a
way to put our finger on the scale
you're point about immutable traits I
think that this is this is the tricky
part here right immutable traits are
absolutely a demarcation line of the way
people experience life in our
society so again when you say like look
corporate Dei it's really tough to focus
on immutable
traits it I think we've got to figure
out then like between social restoration
where immutable traits like race or
class like the ZIP code you're born into
which often correlates with race in our
society because of redlining and housing
segregation and a variety of historical
forces that has a huge bearing on your
life Arc right I mean like in in the
wealthiest country in the world when
you're the ZIP code you're born in
overdetermines your outcomes a huge
problem in the society and those the The
Arc of your your experience being so
affected by immutable traits shows up in
the Dei conversation the question then
is I think that you're trying to ask is
what parts of the Dei conversation are
relevant to a for-profit corporation a
tech company I think that there's real
stickiness and firm ground around
inclusion and high performance
teams right so so like Kelly you've
brought this up before right as I
brought into catalog of HR Heretics
right when you're trying to put your
finger on like where where can we find
the business Roi of anything in the Dei
space in tech companies I think that
team Effectiveness the team is the unit
of performance as you scale right if
you're 100 person you know like preed
whatever then you it's a bunch of ic's
but as you as you scale and you've got
thousand 5,000 people or you're big the
team becomes the unit of performance
right and so for me
high performance teams becomes this real
Edge where the whole Behavioral Science
of inclusion you can take something like
belonging talk about it through a Dei
lens or you can talk about it through
the human need we have as Homo sapiens
to belong and you can skill a leader to
lead for belonging and unlock as an
outcome resilience that's a that's a to
me that has a lot of business Roi
associated with yeah I just talked to
someone last week and I got pretty
pretty hot on the topic because this
obsess
with measuring and you said to your
point Nolan it's very hard to measure
the ROI and I just got kind of annoyed
because I've said this so many times I
love a good metric I love data I also
think one of the biggest forces that
impacts a p&amp;l is things that you can't
put a number on it's a Vibe it's an
ethos it's a feeling it is that magic
that happens when great people come
together and support each other and that
that is essentially a lot of the I and
the B and this you get to that through a
lot of the d d and work like it's just
it it makes me it makes me a little
irritable when everything has to be
measured there was an obsession about
that remember v j know like last 10
years an obsession and the the easiest
thing you can measure is immutable
traits and hiring in especially in the
Heyday when people are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hiring
 
out of my own mouth the best way to move
the pie charts is through Mass hiring
and measuring this stuff and everyone
got obsessed with measuring the
representation and again I I told all
CEOs this like the the invisible thing
that will impact your p&amp;l more than any
oh equal or more than a lot of other
things is is the people that are in your
organization how they're feeling how
they're working together how they're
working and that that is the invisible
ible Glacier that can like accelerate
you or or or sink or stall you and
there's not a lot of there's not there's
not enough appreciation for that I I
agree Kelly I strongly agree with you
and and on the point of vibe right I I
think just to Steelman the the side of
the the the companies that have gone
away from this what I have heard
interacting with some of these sea-level
leaders is that it became more divisive
than it was we're all rowing in the same
direction I candidly believe you know
just you know you had you mentioned
Alexander earlier but J so like let's
let's get into that so so scale AI CEO
Alexander Wayne came out with the Mei
policy and that's obviously gone way
bigger than I initially expected because
it didn't it had seem that crazy to me
but I would love to get your take on
this but what I read into that what I
read is is that the the the over focus
on Dei was exactly going
antagonistically to what you're
describing Kelly it wasn't improving the
vibe it was creating camps of people
versus having everybody in it together
to win and so VJ I'm curious to get your
take on that you know it's so
interesting where corporate conversation
reflects the social conversation right
so Nolan the thing you just said has
been part of disc workplace discussions
I've had for over 20 years because if
you work in education
there's this question of you know is
theft of multiculturalism the salad or
the you the melting you know like do you
remember some of the conversations in
there the 90s right and and so as we
allow people to be who they want to be
how do we deal with the need for there
to be a unified whole there's there's
useful academic work on this right
there's a theory called the theory of
act optimal distinction where there's a
parabolic Arc between how how how
differentiated a group is and how
satisfied they are in the group
experience if the group gets too
differentiated satisfaction actually
drops if the group isn't allowed to
differentiate at all satisfaction also
drops and that's where you see like a
true you know bellur parabolic Arc where
there is a sweet spot where there's
enough differentiation that people can
be who they want to be but there's also
enough shared meaning value goal
ethic purpose profit motive you know
whatever it is rsus you know to actually
then give you cohesion cohesion is jet
fuel for the team right cohesion is jet
fuel for the company so as we think
about this dance and and the science of
high performing teams what often is
missing in the sea Suite is is the right
dashboard right so when people say oh
diversity is leading to fragmentation
look homogeneous teams might offer the
illusion
of an easy onramp to cohes and you do
see it you see it in um early stage
startups right 30 40 50 people in a room
there's often they're super homogeneous
right because of you know what OA folks
would call Network right we tend to hire
people exactly like us you all have been
great about naming this on your show
Kelly I know you regularly double click
on this right but when you look at those
organizations they actually get the
benefit of H homogeneous teams which is
they can move really quickly they share
a language they share a form of
intelligence going back to Alex's thing
about we're going to hire for
intelligence which intelligence who's
intelligence there's a lot of different
intelligences out there but when you
have 40 4050 people that are all very
similar you can move super fast you can
communicate in these short hands and if
you've ever been in that kind of
environment it feels like you're on like
the 96 Bulls right but there are so many
fractures and
fissures around the downside of that
homogen right you're you're missing some
of the complexity that can actually help
someone on the team go hey before we
release this next thing we should have
you ever thought that this might
actually land poorly on the audience or
whatever it might be there's there's
some obvious benefits to friction and
the friction that comes from difference
does slow things down it can cause
fracturing the question is are you going
to skill your team leaders to be able to
harness the diversity on the team to be
productive if you don't there's a ton of
research that supports your thesis Nolan
that a poorly managed diverse team
underperforms against a poorly managed
homogeneous team it's easier to lead a
homogeneous team it's harder to lead a
diverse team and so when organizations
committed to diversity hiring to go back
to the foibles here right well we
actually work to rapidly diversify the
workforce and we do not deal with
manager Effectiveness managers end up
doing a really bad job with teams that
are sitting here going well we think and
communicate so differently about this
set of problems based on the fact that
we have very different lived experiences
that we sit in different geographies
that we sit in different time zones and
cultures and so in some ways the promise
of diversity Kelly you said this only
unlocks with Catalyst of inclusion and
and that's still basic and then and then
what happens right that's like running
around with scissors then what happens
is you actually cause more divisiveness
because the frustration seeps in because
you're not bringing them together and
then those folks I'm just playing this
out right they go to their affinity
group meetings they're venting rightly
so and a CA more device so so I I have
one one last question for evj and it's
built on this is I believe that how how
how well this this shows up in an
organization or how how it doesn't right
it causes divisiveness the programs that
are out there make people farther apart
versus together is how
this is set up right not not from the
Dei leader this isn't a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like
sales leader noan this isn't someone who
who can can kind of pull strings and
make money or and get fired because
they're not meeting go this person is a
lot of times at the mercy of the
organization and how much these people
get it because they can't do this work
effectively unless everyone in the
organization is with them and they're
doing it effectively so it's not like
just a a pug and pay sales later that
you can make make money or not make
money this if the organization doesn't
get it this person is toast like they're
not going to be successful but it takes
me to what you said it earlier VJ what
is the next trapas bar right if you had
a magic wand if you had a magic
eightball like what would you either
create or what what do you see because I
do think and I've said this in former
shows we are in we are in the middle of
like the page turning to the next
chapter I just don't think anyone really
knows what that is and I'm just
wondering if you had again a magic
wander and aall what so and just before
you respond but Jay I just want to to
quickly say I don't think my last point
was was wellard which is I don't believe
it's about diversity being the I
actually think there's plenty of data to
support that diverse teams have better
outcomes I completely with you on
everything that you just said I think
it's
programmatically how do we try and
Achieve that that is causing the
divisiveness which goes into Kelly's
question fair fair thanks for for
doubling back on that Nolan it's
important to to get that framed
correctly so you know couple of next
trapeze bars I see where there's there
is a a huge firefight happening around
Dei in our society corporations some
corporations are using this as a full
chance to genicon but actually many
aren't I'm engaged broadly with HR
leaders across and and I know that we're
heavy on Tech in this discussion but I
work in manufacturing consumer goods
Transportation energy and there are many
sectors that are slower and quieter
about their investment in Dei that are
actually now in the face of of you know
all the fracturing that's happening
they're actually investing for a whole
set of different reasons but I do think
that potentially some maturation of the
Dei program can come out of the C that
we're going through right now couple of
examples I think a lot of organizations
are looking at ergs right now and going
huh okay we get that ergs can be an
engine of belonging for specific groups
that find themselves struggling with
being the only on their team right and
so the only the the the loneliness of
onliness is a real thing if you've ever
been the only one on your team it's
difficult to do the best work of your
life and so it's helpful to have one
space you can go to to feel normal
recharge your battery go back to your
team do good work I mean this is the
basic science of why Affinity groups
drive better performance but there are
so many next steps in the ERG road map
that are actually about business Roi so
how do we see ergs as places where we
can actually get advice on product
inclusion and product relevance based on
new demographic markets we're trying to
go after or product inclusion for people
with disabilities when I was at VMware
there was a a strong Synergy between
between the disability awareness ERG
which had a very very strong
representation of people with
disabilities in it and the product
inclusion team that was looking at very
very high-tech products like vsphere and
trying to make sure that there was you
know really strong accessibility Tech
built into vmware's core stack there's
ways to think about ergs in terms of
talent strategy and Nolan you might have
been doing this at door Das right but
when you level up into level two level
three ERG playbooks then your ergs are
helping you with active ations helping
you actually bring a value case to your
future um Talent pipeline around the the
value of working at that company and the
way that ergs can testify about employee
experience is far more powerful for than
for employer brand than marketing can
because it's going to you know
conferences and other kinds of
activations and being able to say look I
have a great experience here as a as a
woman engineer yada y y so there's you
know the the movement towards saying
well in what ways in the for the context
of each business and that's different in
each business can we take something like
ergs and move up the maturity curve
towards business Roi and there's a
forcing function I think driving a long
overdue maturation of that I think in
other areas I think the work on teams I
mean this is I have a book coming out
this fall on high performing teams where
I've taken a lot of the Behavioral
Science that I used to use every day as
a Dei person and deployed it
agnostically as this is how people do
amazing work if you lead in these ways
if you turn up the volume on trust
belonging and connection your team will
be better at navigating endless
disruption right and there's there's a
ton of Behavioral Science evidence to
that and so I get really strong uptick
from HR audiences around like great
thanks for giving us a radically
simplified approach to taking something
like psychological safety refactoring it
as trust deploying it at the team level
in a set of practical skills that are
not being pushed through the lens of
identity but rather being pushed through
the lens of performance so I think that
that's part of the shift yeah and I I
don't know about you both I've seen a
push for de teams to lead to own and or
be a part of organizational
Effectiveness or talent management teams
because of that reason that's right and
that goes back to Kelly the point you've
made previous times right inclusion can
actually be a guarant or a driver not a
guarant but a driver or a catalyst in
the kinds of performance mechanics team
cohesion team resilience Innovation
ideation outcomes and so I think that's
the next step is is that Paradigm Shift
successfully grabbing the next rung on
the Trappin and and learning to
communicate about Dei not from the sense
of social purpose if you're in a
for-profit particularly a publicly held
for a profit but learning to communicate
about this around the individual team
and organizational Roi I agree v j what
would you say to the I think growing
group of people who aspired to and I've
been using even the MLK quote around you
know he has a dream that his four
children will be able to live in a
nation that will not be judged by the
color of their skin but the content of
their character and so I I wonder about
this in business because I I do think it
is it has gotten to this divisive level
and this is the conversation today is
like should should the goal be around
blindness for race religion and politics
is that is is that like is that our
Northstar wow Nolan ending on a ending
on a very light fcil Point actually like
so you know look the King quote the King
quote about color of skin versus content
of character has been brought up for 40
years now around what I would say is a
Mal appropriation of the quote to
justify colorblind social policy that
actually hurts communities of color
that's in the social sphere inside a
corporation so you know again trying to
distinguish here between socially
restorative Dei for public policy and
corporate Dei business strategy inside a
corporation one I think you're legally
required to try and address you know
protected classes and discrimination and
so you should be trying to create an
environment in which people are actually
treated based on their individual
performance and here's the the reason
Alex's Mei framework landed like a
flaming turd on so many people's
sensibilities is because we are so far
from that in human organizations the
level at which bias and
noise infects every aspect of talent
attraction Talent acquisition T Talent
evaluation promotion I mean it's it's
rampant and I think any honest
conversation would have to name that
these are really imperfect systems that
are about the humans and the scaling of
human errors and decision Mak across
human Networks so when you take that
kind of a like a network Theory view on
this then what we know is that we need
some sort of an intervention to actually
make it so that people's immutable
factors are not limiting their ability
to function and so like
Dei if you want to even incrementally
Edge towards King's Vision you then you
can't do it without Dei the the the you
know the the flaw in Alex's reasoning is
that you can abandon in inclusion and
equity and somehow reach meritocracy and
I it just doesn't math out for me here
because our starting place right now is
so topographically uneven completely
agree that and this is where the details
come in so I look VJ this has been an
awesome conversation I do appreciate you
engaging in the conversation in a in a
good faith manner I know that these are
very tough but our commitment to our
audience is is to engage to try and
bring different perspectives into the
conversation so I really appreciate you
coming on the show and getting to this
this level of conversation with us thank
you VJ yeah it's been great being here
I've learned a lot preparing for today
and having the conversation with the two
of you so thank you for having thank you
