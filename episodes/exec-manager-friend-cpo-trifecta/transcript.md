what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR heretic segment today we're
going to talk about context switching so
Kelly this is one of those like hard
lessons I've had to learn and I think
context switching as you grow in your
career especially if like you become a
manager or an Z becomes one of those
essential skills that you have to
develop and so I want to talk to you a
little bit about this of like how do you
think about context switching in your
day how do you think about context
switching with your different hats such
as like cheap people officer hat to
manager to friend how do you think about
all these different modes and roles that
you have to play yeah it's been I've
talked a lot about this with folks
actually cuz it's it's like I feel like
for 25 years I've had 10 meetings a day
that are like D dink dink and and you
know they're randomized you can't
control whe when you're talking to again
I'll have a one-onone with like an S an
icdr and then go into a C team meeting
and then go into an all hands meeting
and then go into an HR team meeting like
it's it's a lot and uh there are nuances
with how you know you frame things for
those different
audiences altitude of which you talk
about
things things you can or can't talk
about things you want to take advantage
of and position things or influence and
there's chronologies to that and so it
is a very like instinctual art form that
I actually spend a lot of time with my
leaders now and people that I coach
talking about it because it can be very
powerful if used well but it can be very
confusing and just all over the map and
you don't know up from down if not that
makes sense yeah there's a lot of nuance
so I'll start with the
context switching between different
roles and you know I think in the cheap
people officer role it's really tough
because you associate with your peers as
exec you associate with your boss who is
the CEO you associate with your team who
directly reports into you then you
associate with like the entire broader
company uh typically in the role of CPO
and so um you know the other thing too
is just like building authentic
relationships like say you're you're out
of work and trying to just like build
relationships with folks I think that's
actually one of the areas where you have
to be most Comfort or most thoughtful
about how you interact so one of the one
of the things that I did that I think
worked really well is I always had um I
always had my guard very low like I
didn't want to be like one of those like
really button UPS like you know I speak
like a robot type of person when I
interact with folks right but what
you'll find is is especially in uh in
settings where people get comfortable
with you is they will start to ask you
probing questions and you need to be
very careful about how you respond and
so one of the things or one of the
tactics that I used is when somebody
would ask me a you know probing question
about something that maybe I shouldn't
get into I would literally in real time
say okay I now have to put my chief
people officer hat on and uh you know be
very clear with you that like this is an
area I can't get into and so I think the
context switching as you grow in your
career even if you're just a manager uh
you may be privy to information that
your direct team either shouldn't know
or can't know and how you interact with
those people you need to be very careful
and do so in a way to where you're still
authentic and still a real person but
you can't cross the line of getting into
uh these difficult conversations which
could compromise your ability to get
things done totally I mean you are
constantly making sure that you're aware
of again the audience their family
reference how they're seeing things what
they know what they're experiencing how
they see you you know what kind of
relationship you're trying to have with
folks and i' I've found that you know
just just being honest and authentic
like that and most importantly
consistent um is is is really important
because you you know you're the CPO of a
thousand person company this happens 20
times let's say in a quarter those 20
people are going to tell you know 10
people each I mean your
reputation gets out there really quickly
and I've seen and heard of a lot of HR
leaders that are just bad behavior
inconsistent kind of in the gossip Mill
just powers for bad type of thing it's
not a good look and that that ability to
context switch quickly while being
honest and being
consistent is is just necessary
you have to learn the skill now the
other one I want to talk about with
Contex switching is getting your work
done and you know this is again one of
those skills that you have to develop as
you scale into your career but you know
one of the things it turns out that even
if you're an executive like you still
have IC work to be done especially in
this day and age to where everybody has
to do more with less but you also have
to be able to manage your team you also
have to be able to show up be very
present in uh in in your meetings with
your peers and then also in like all
hands and so Kelly how do you think
about just like getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done and
managing all of these different balls
that are in the air not only with your
like work life but also your personal
life yeah the ball the balls in the air
everyone loves to say that and everyone
loves to say well you have to make sure
to know which balls are glass and which
B like come on the reality is we got to
have all of them in the air like can't
really drop any of them and in my
experience you know one you have to
build a great team we just talked about
in our last segment that is trustworthy
transparent and that you can literally
pivot them very quickly like you have to
build this team where they are all
ninjas and they're all really good and
they can all just move and I don't think
a lot of folks spend enough time on that
because you know they're pulled into 25
different directions at C team level
then they're pulled into crap at you
know employee issues and they don't
spend a l enough time building the these
these kind of you know these these copy
paste not copy paste but these these
Army of you right that you can you can
move very quickly and get stuff done the
other thing that I I talk a lot about
with folks
is the maximization of meetings in time
like I am a a total freak about ordering
of meetings how we leverage them to get
you know 1 plus 1 equals
 
job was through meetings and like how
how do I use those right like I have my
people leadership team meeting this
afternoon then tomorrow I have a c te
meeting how can I how can I like not
just go to the those meetings and go to
the day and blah blah blah how do I
think about those meetings strategically
and leverage them to get more done in
those three hours than I could otherwise
and I spend so much time talking to my
directs about that because it's amazing
what you can do example we might be like
all right we want to push some RTO work
we we we're we're you know behind or
we're pinched Etc let's leverage this
people leadership team meeting let's
frame it up for C team the next day
let's get two of you in there with me
one for exposure and learning so now
I've got succession planning I've got
people learning how to be a CPO I've got
exposure let's get in there and use that
strategically to move this ball forward
between those two meetings have done
well and architected well you can get
more done in those three hours that
potentially screwing around with
documents and one-on ones and policies
for two weeks
so don't think I don't think folks
leverage these meetings enough because
they are contact switching it's like
great how do I parlay and use these
things maybe we cap cap it all off with
an all hands at the end boom like they
they they are very they can be very
strategic and they can help you
accelerate and it's also very hard
because they come fast lots of context
switching you got to be in front of the
aall and you got to be strategic and
that takes time and takes a lot of
learning hey everyone we'll be right

Heretics Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metaview

interview process their AI records and

intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a time
saer because perfect notes means perfect
data for every candidate in every
pipeline hiring teams can make confident
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
Flora and check out metaview head over

or get started for free you'll be up
running an AI enabled in minutes my take
is Contex switching is not a real thing
like if you want to be a context
switcher you're going to do multiple
things not well and there's a great book
called essentialism uh which like really
changed my life about like you have to
focus on one thing at a time because
that's how the human brain works and so
this whole notion of like you know being
able to jugle things simultaneously and
like you're in a meeting and you're
texting and then you're emailing and
then you're interacting like that
doesn't exist you just show up terrible
in all of those aspects so here's my
priority list number one is me like
first thing is like I have to sleep I
have to work out and I have to eat well
that generates like my energy level and
that helps me show up in the way that I
want to show up number two is my family
like I have to fill up my cup with
spending time with my wife my kids my
parents my sister all of my loved ones
number three is work right we'll get to
that in a second um and then basically I
have a hard line and then there's like
everything else and after that hard line
I will be very honest with our audience
I'm not good because there's just too
much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and like I just I can't do it
that well it's just not going to happen
and I'm okay with that let's talk about
the work piece for a second so I love um
I love your idea of strategically
scheduling meetings um one of the things
that I stole from Jeff Bezos is like I
don't like to do meetings before 11: and
the reason why is because I can get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
done in the morning and I focus on like
the most important thing that requires
like me like if I'm the Blocker on it or
I'm the person who owns the thing that's
my time to like get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done um
another thing is is like I try not to to
live out of email anymore this is still
one of those habits I'm I'm trying to
break but like email and Slack are
amazing because like you know it's such
a great way to communicate with people
the problem is is you end up being very
reactive and other people are dictating
the course of your day and your week
versus you being the one that dictates
the course of your day and week so one
of the things I've done is like I I
don't have
notifications on my phone except for
from My Wife and so like if I want to go
look at Twitter I don't get
notifications for Twitter anymore I
don't get notifications for email I
don't get notifications for slack on my
phone my phone is basically like my wife
can reach me and then nobody else can
because if I get pulled into that I know
I'm going to spend 10 to 15 minutes in
an unproductive fashion the last thing
I'll say that that we've been
experimenting with on my team right now
that's been working amazingly well is I
think a lot of the meetings that we have
at work are status
updates and status update meetings I
think actually are important but we
waste so much time going around the
circle like listening to that person
like talk about their thing so we've
replaced the status meeting with
looms and basically what people do is we
have a wbr a weekly Business Review
every week and we do a loom and so I can
watch that Loom on 2x speed I can pause
and zoom in at certain areas of like
into the presentation I ask questions
directly on the loom and so then when we
walk into the meeting it's not what's
the status the meeting is like let's go
answer these questions so we can start
getting to work right away and those are
the things that I I wish more people
would do especially with me meetings
waste so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time I I love it
is unbelievable I love the loom idea I
think that I've noticed with context
switching and the meetings is ever since
the the pandem like you know more remote
more zooms it wastes a lot of time and
so thing I've done to cut down the
context switching and have more time to
think get stuff done and like set things
up so you
can accelerate work and be strategic is
replace meetings with just phone calls
or my God please yes I've like I swear
the last four years of my career I've
dialed more people than the six years
prior and it's been incredible like you
you can get so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done in a seven
minute chat and a phone call than a 40
minute Zoom with someone and it's it's
what it's done for me at least is
created more of that feeling where you
get the serendipitous see someone in the
hallway type of thing the thing that I
don't like about the written is just
some people just write terribly and
context doesn't get through Nuance is
missing right and it might not even be
poorly written but you're chatting with
someone you get you get the vibe you get
the context you get more information
especially to do with people HR related
stuff it's actually really important
that you get that writing takes time
writing takes and and and honestly for
big decisions it makes sense like I
totally get it for everything else it's
just like man are we really going to put
that time in stuff yeah yeah and the
other thing i' I've started using which
is awesome is the audio text yeah you do
this to me all the time which is kind of
like loom without the video it's
incredible it's like hey yeah I'm
sending this and then I love so I love
it because it's like you know it's
there's two pieces that are really
beneficial is one it takes me less time
to send the audio text and two it takes
you less time to listen to it
right it's just so much easier to do
while you're driving yeah just it's very
helpful I'm talk so it's helpful and
then of course I'm like did it send did
you get it and then we waste time hey
did you get this yeah I do want to
underscore the just pick up the phone
thing it's incredible one of the things
I love to do is walk and talk and zoom
does not allow that like it like you
know if you've ever tried to like walk
with a phone in front of your face like
one you just look like a clown
um and then two like the other person's
like what like why are we doing this I
think there are meetings that really
require you to either be in person or be
on Zoom yes but the majority of them do
not and we've just defaulted to zoom
because that's what everyone's done
since the pandemic and so I think what
Kelly and I are saying to our audience
is like be the change like stop zooming
people when it could just be a phone
call and oh by the way like go get
outside
like go for a walk it's amazing the sort
of stimulation you get when you're just
outside breathing fresh air and talking
to another human being yeah just do that
experiment I've been doing the last like
two years I'm like hey do you mind if we
chat on the phone I I got to get out and
I swear 80% time oh my God yes me too
but no one will actually do it so just
do it and everyone else is going to jump
for joy be that change Kelly be the
change all right let us know what you
guys think all right thanks
