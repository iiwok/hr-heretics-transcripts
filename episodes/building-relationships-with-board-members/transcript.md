What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Kelly,
what up girl? I miss you.
&gt;&gt; What's the word? How are we doing? It's
been a while.
&gt;&gt; You know, it has been a while. We're
back in the saddle, though. Everyone's
been asking like,
&gt;&gt; "Where are you guys been? What are you
guys doing?" You know, turns out like we
have lives, too. Like
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what I was doing. I was at
the chiropractor cuz my old my
back back was out. No one's like, "Hey,
you still want to record today?" I'm
like, "Yeah, it's fired up. It's 3:30 on
a Thursday." Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Let's go, baby. Let's go. All right. So,
we're going to do Dear Heretics today.
And so, here it is. Dear Heretics, what
are the best practices around updating
the board on people matters? What do
they need to know like hirings and
firings versus what would be great to
share and get their input or strategic
lens on? For context, our board is small
and there isn't a people focused expert
on it. They meet monthly. Is it typical
for people ops to meet the board
periodically to give information
firsthand or do updates usually flow
through the CEO co-founders? Kelly, what
do you think?
&gt;&gt; I love it. This is a great topic and
it's a fuzzy one because you know best
practice there isn't one. That's the
hard that's the real answer, my friend.
There is not a best practice. It is
&gt;&gt; all situational. It is things something
you need to feel out and then once you
felt it out and you're in it and you've
established whatever dynamic or
relationship and there's a whole another
level of nuance and considerations and
balance. So I guess to kick it off
Nolan, my first answer is
do you know what the dynamic is? Like I
was I was just talking to a company the
past few months about joining and
whatnot and one of my initial questions
to the founder CEO was tell me about the
board. Tell me about your relationship
with the board. Let's go through each
member and why they invested if they're
independent. How did you choose them?
What do they care about? How do you
interact with them? How would I interact
with them? and you get a very nice like
overlay of of again the dynamic and the
vibe of that and then secretly you get a
reaction whether that leader feels
comfortable with you or not interacting
with the board and in my experience for
many reasons we can talk about if
they're not comfortable and they're like
oh you don't have to worry about that
you don't need to come to board meetings
you don't need to red flag
what do you think
&gt;&gt; it's situational uh I think a couple of
Other layers I would add in is the
seniority of the people person, right?
So like someone at your level for sure,
right? Um you know me at Door Dash
definitely not, right? I was like 27 at
the time. Um so that's thing one. Thing
two is is like what problem is the
company solving? Um and where are they
at in their life cycle? So if it's, you
know, an early stage company that's
scaling up, like, yeah, we got to talk
about people all the time. If it's a
much later stage company that, you know,
kind of has everything figured out and
it's just the machine is working and
we're focused on other things, then
potentially not. I will say for the
people leader, I I just had a
conversation with a friend yesterday and
I told him, if you don't set the
strategy and communicate the strategy,
somebody else will.
Yes.
&gt;&gt; And so that needs to be expressed to the
CEO certainly like that's the bare
minimum. But ultimately if you are the
leader, you do need to communicate it to
the board and have regular check-ins and
a relationship with them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you bring up a really
really smart point that I probably
should have asterricked before I jumped
in. Um is to have awareness of your
level and how you're coming in. You know
what I mean? Like to your point, a
firsttime head of HR at a 50 person
company is much different. So the last
thing you want to do is listen to this
and be in that position and and stomp
around and demand that you're going to
be in the board. Absolutely not. So
thank you for that. Having judgment
around those things.
However, no matter what situation you're
in, you're you're you're totally right
that if you don't somehow get this
defined and present and and represented
in some way, whether it's you or your
CEO or someone else, you're totally
correct. Those board meetings, they will
throw in opinions, um demands, ideas,
and then it will fall on you as now the
tactical non-strategic pair of hands. So
just try, you know, and if you have a
really good relationship with your CEO
and you're doing good stuff and you have
great strategic ideas, perhaps you you
can say or what I would do is say, "Hey,
maybe not ne this quarter, maybe next
quarter, can we partner maybe on a 15 20
minute segment I can pop into the board,
not join the meeting, can pop in to hit
some of these key areas around people
and talent that we're feeling are are
critical to the business." That is
different than
&gt;&gt; delicate. It it is it is
&gt;&gt; yeah it's it's really delicate and for
for me on that it's
&gt;&gt; you need to be adding value like you
don't just like you know show up to the
board meeting because like we you know
want to see what's going on in there
like you need to come with a purpose. Uh
one of the things I learned from Henry
at Carta was when we meet with the board
we should be telling them what we're
doing and then strategically asking them
for help.
So that was kind of always our framework
was like here's our plan. Here's what
we're doing. Here's how things are
going. Here's where we can use you.
&gt;&gt; And so if you are like so if we're
talking about a firsttime, you know,
people person and you haven't had yet
the opportunity to interact with the
board, what I would do is I would go to
the CEO and I would say, look, I'm going
to present my plan to you and if you're
align with that, I want to present it to
the board. Um, the goal here is that I
want them to understand what we're
doing, the challenges that we're facing,
and where they can help us. What do you
think? That's how I would present it.
What do you think about that,
&gt;&gt; Kelly? Well, it's it's kind of similar
to what I mentioned, you know, before,
which I totally agree is is and the and
the takeaway of that is do it with your
CEO. Don't tell them you want to do it.
So the universal thread and all that
Nolan is is in the end of it, it's not
about you telling the board you want to
be a part of it. What happens first is
you earn the right to be there through
your CEO thinking you are amazing and
valuable, strategic, needing to be
there. Um then they tell the board, do
you know what I mean? and and and when
that happens, when CEOs have great HR
leaders, I feel like it just becomes
part of their business. For example,
when I joined Pendo, it wasn't even a
question. Todd was like, "You're in the
board meeting." But a couple companies
prior, I had to earn that and talk about
it cuz I was more junior and coming up.
Do you see what I mean? So that CEO is
the one that's going to advocate for you
to be there. It's not just a given. And
to do that, build it with them to the
kind of some of the role playing we just
did. Hey everyone, we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors.

AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. MetaView is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metave's suite of AI agents works for
you at every stage of the hiring
process. Their platform powers instant
job postc creation, AI powered candidate
Q&amp;A, insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metiv changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metivview covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing

experts or get started for free. You'll
be up running an AI enabled in minutes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The other thing is like so so say
then you get the invite to the meeting.
the fidelity of information you give to
the board is very dependent on the
board, the company and the problems the
the company's facing. So, you know,
sometimes CEOs are super transparent.
Sometimes they're a little bit opaque.
You have to figure that out. So, I'll
just tell you like what we did, which I
thought was a good framework. Uh, every
person who presented at the board
meeting, the first slide was like a
going well, not going well slide. So
just like a very quick executive summary
on what was up both good and bad.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Then we did the clickin on like the um
what we had said last time and the
update from from last time. Then we did
the focus for like the next quarter or
two quarters like where we were going
what we were going to be doing as a team
and then we any specific like ask for
help. What was your framework on how you
presented?
&gt;&gt; Very similar. The thing I would add on
top of that is how to
uh operationalize that in a way that's
just how you run your business. So it's
not like these big 11th hour scrambles.
Oh my god, the board meeting. Let's put
together this. Just run your business
that way. So tactically, very
tactically, do a QBR every quarter with
your business. Um have that same flow,
have that same mindset of how you're
running this thing like a business and
what it's doing. um for the for the
organization for the top and the bottom
line and your goals like just tie it all
together, force yourself and your team
to do that every quarter. And I
basically know just take a subset of
that QBR deck, tweak it as needed, trim
it down, um be a little bit more clear
on like what are the just the three
target messages that flow nicely with
the topic or the story we want to get
across to the board that quarter as a
team and that's how it flows in.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Totally. What about board
relationships?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's where I wanted to go
next. Um,
you know, again, please, you know, use
judgment and don't be a a bulldog and
demand this stuff in a way that just
backfires. However, in my career, Nolan,
I wish I would have
built relationships with board members
earlier in my career. I really didn't
start to like rub elbows with board
members probably until
hired days which was like 2016 2017. Um,
I really wish I would have started doing
that like 2012, 2013. And the reason for
that is because
what you learn and how you start talking
about talent and people and all the
things underneath the lens of what a
board member cares about and how they
think helps you become a better business
leader. You're just forced to talk in a
different way. Do you know what I mean?
Um, the second thing, I'll be really
honest with everyone. They're just
 people. Like, I I was so
intimidated. I'm like, "Oh, these board
members." And they're they're just
people and they're learning just like
you are. And ironically, as board
members get more experienced and more
removed from operating, they're learning
from you just as much as you're learning
from them. And so that was just a
demystifying
thing for me is that you can actually
talk to them like this and they love
that. Some board members I've known for
years and we text and we you know what I
mean? We free form and we talk in slang.
It's it's just something that's really
helpful. Um and it can be really fun.
It's a different angle conversation.
I'll tell you the third Nolan. And
you know, I've been uh the head of, you
know, chief people officer at two
Sapphire portfolio companies now. Um
board members, they're your funnel to
the next thing. They they are literally
a and not just your funnel for jobs,
everyone. I'm talking about they they
will break down
&gt;&gt; the lemons from the rockets. They will
talk to you about every angle of the the
upside, the TAM, the financial look.
They will help you find the next best
thing for you. Um, and help you assess
these companies and funnel them to you,
but also in a lens, in a way that knows
you, right, and your style and your
culture because they work with these
founders day in and day out.
&gt;&gt; If you have a good relationship,
right, that's the main thing. And it's
just like every other relationship. It
is very contextual and dependent on the
board member. So some of these people
actually just don't give a about
people and talent stuff.
&gt;&gt; And that's cool, right? Like that's
totally fine. Like you have to be able
to have the tact and the understanding
of like who's actually asking questions
at the meeting,
&gt;&gt; right? And that's the person that you're
going to go build the first relationship
with.
&gt;&gt; Yes. And that's
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm sorry. And that and that is on
us and that helps you choose the right
venture companies for their port codes.
Cuz I can tell you even if you like them
as a person, if they don't give a
about people and talent, I probably
would copy and paste that to other
portfolio companies in their firm kind
of thing.
&gt;&gt; It's so I don't I don't know. I I don't
know. I think it's like some of these
people just totally optimize on like
product or go to market or something.
And um I've been in some board meetings
to where I know somebody cares about
people's stuff, but they're just not
they they know they're not smart enough
to opine on it and so they don't say
anything, right? That's kind of more of
what I mean. But what what I was getting
at though is
&gt;&gt; is like
&gt;&gt; for the person who's asking questions,
right? What I would do if I'm building
that relationship from zero is after the
meeting, I would email them and say,
"Hey, really appreciated the questions.
Would love to spend some more time
together." Uh, and then that way you
could kind of slowly grow that thing.
Start with one, right? Don't try and
boil the ocean. Like boards can have
like seven to 10 people. That can be
very overwhelming. Start with one. My my
strategy at Carta was was basically just
to have one really good relationship and
then try and grow that as time went on.
And to your point, like that
relationship for me was um was Spark uh
and Andrew at Spark and I loved him and
we're still super tight to this day. And
so, you know, you're not going to have
warm and fuzzy relationships with all of
them. It's just gonna have uh, you know,
different sorts of feelings. But for me,
that one was great. And then I went and
built one with John at USV. Uh, you
know, Mark Andre joined the board right
as I was leaving Carter, so I didn't get
a chance to to build it with him. But
like ultimately, these are people, to
your point, I still talk to all the
time. Like Alex Kurlin pinged me like a
week ago. Yeah. And you know this is the
other thing I will mention on this is
the older I get the smaller the world
becomes.
And these people tend to be the
connectors right to your point around
Sapphire like thinking about
opportunities for you. I I just describe
them as super connectors.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; They have a much wider aperture. And so
your job in the meeting is provide
value. Your job after the meeting is
build the relationship. And that can
help you in your current role and at at
some point in the future.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The last thing I'll say is when
you're doing that and let's say that's
going all well and you're having dinner
or coffee or whatever it is with f do
not forget your relationship with your
CEO in that role comes first. Do not
forget that it is delicate. Um it is
tricky. Right? I kind of got buzzed saw
it a long time ago and a board member
was like, "Hey, what do you think about
the CRO?"
Do you know what I mean? And we weren't
really ready to talk about that with
that person yet. And I didn't say a lot,
but I in hindsight, I probably said a
little bit more than I should have. Um,
and it's not like this board member was
trying to play detective and had bad
intent, but it can create some some
tricky situations. So just make sure
you're in lock step with your CEO when
it comes to the business and the people
and kind of what
what you're you're ready to tell them
and when if that makes sense.
&gt;&gt; Two things here. One is discretion,
right? So like when you're having
private conversations with the board,
you need to have ultimate discretion.
The second thing I think to say it a
little bit more pointedly
your relationship
uh and basically who's team you're on
team CEO
&gt;&gt; period full stop.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If I can use an analogy which I
love like you're your CEO is like your
brother or sister like you're just kind
of assuming you have good relationship
with your brother or sister but you're
just kind of kind of there right you're
you're you're unfiltered usually you
trust each other ideally it's a the
boards are kind of like your cousins.
you like them, but maybe you're not, you
know, spilling it all, you know, all the
time. You're a little bit more, like you
said, using discretion and judgment. Um,
a little bit more tempered. It just
depends on the situation.
&gt;&gt; It's super delicate and you got to be
very careful. I I like you had made that
mistake earlier in my career and it it
wasn't like too bad, but you realize
after the fact like, oh did I just
say something that like you shouldn't be
the person breaking news? Maybe to say
it more succinctly, it's like this is
this is not your like ultimately it's
your CEO's relationship and an extension
of that relationship.
&gt;&gt; That's a great rule of thumb. Yeah, this
is a great topic. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Dear Heretics,
&gt;&gt; love these. Talk to you guys soon.
Peace.
&gt;&gt; Love it.
