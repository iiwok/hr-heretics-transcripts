what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics all right
Jared Fleer I'm stoked to have you on
and I want to give the audience like a a
little bit of your eclectic background
you were a growth hacker earlier in your
career before growth hacker was actually
a term you run the exec team of slide
which was acquired by Google you became
a general partner and Venture before
joining scrib as coo now you run a
Founder coaching business where you're a
cross between advisor pseudo board
member and Coach with testimonials from
the tech Legends like keithb boy Max
leevin and Jack Abraham welcome to the
show thanks so much for having me all
right so I want to start with the the
radical performance review process that
you ran at script can you tell our
audience about it so little bit of
context here I went and worked at Google
after they acquired slide and so I got
this up close and personal view of what
is arguably the most thorough and
longest process for running performance
reviews that they call some would say
worst some would say worst there are
basically a a massive tradeoff that
they've decided to make between speed
and precision so on the upside they get
the most rigorous feedback that I've
ever seen and arguably the fairest
rewards on the downside it is literally
months of lost productivity where you go
to talk to people and their calendars
are blocked for doing this crazy perf
process and so when I joined scrib we
had a hundred employees they tried a
bunch of different approaches to
performance review processes and
basically given up on it and gone back
and forth and as we grew the team the
process got heavier and heavier and
heavier as we were just trying to get
people feedback and you know figure out
how to do the right thing and and how to
reward them so we decided you know in a
fun way to blow up the process and there
were three things that I really wanted
to focus on that I think are kind of
universal for people that are running
these teams and trying to figure out a
solution the first is you know we wanted
to get helpful accurate feedback to
employees we wanted to be fair and
consistent with it and we were trying to
magically do that while avoiding the
massive drag and loss of productivity
which seemed kind of impossible at the
time and I think one of the things that
people don't really think about around
performance re especially if you're not
in the people org is that this is
serialized you know you can't really
write a manager's assessment if you
haven't read any of the feedback that
you've gotten from peers or a self
assessment or upward feedback and so you
have to do this in stages where like you
know you have self peer and upward then
you have your manager assessment then
you might want to do some calibration to
make sure that one manager and another
manager are thinking about this in the
same way and then after all of that is
done you figure out rewards if you're
going to link that to Promotions or
raises or bonuses or anything like that
that so even if you just spent a week on
each of those things which most people
would consider extremely fast it would
take you a month to do the process
before you even deliver a review and
what I've noticed is that Founders and
Executives focus on that drag and that's
fair nobody loves this process I've
never met a person who says wow it's
great I can't wait as performance
reviews and so you end up in this push
company after company that they see to
reduce the process but somehow magically
get Fair representative feedback and do
the rewards without really doing the
work that's involved to get there so we
took a totally different approach and I
will caveat this by saying I think the
only reason that I could do this was
that I was the co and so it's a little
unfair but I think that if it's HR
leaders that are listening to this it's
really about getting on board and
partnering with the leaders of the
company in order to this and it makes
sense when you stop and you you think
about it so I had about 10 reports uh
that was PR PR standard for our senior
managers and my Approach was to block
off the day write all of my peer reviews
all the same day and then I would block
off another day or two to read all of
the reports and reviews and feedback
that my reports had done so their self
assessments the reviews that their peers
had written and then I would just power
through it and write all of my reviews
in a day or two and I notice as I talk
to people that almost everybody did the
same thing so the challenge with that is
that everyone is doing it at their own
pace and we decided to change this now
the result of that was that we created
the fastest review process that I've
ever seen we got quality feedback that
was fair without the pain of hundreds of
employees doing this all at their own
pace and the key in this was to make
sure everyone was doing it at the same
time so if you don't do this it's kind
of like telling people I want everybody
to take vacation during May versus
saying hey the second week of May we're
going to close the company and everyone
should take their vacation then makes
sense not a complicated solution it's
just not something anybody does and so
we actually shut down the company for a
week we capped our peer reviews we
canceled all of our meetings we didn't
ship anything for a week and on Monday
and Tuesday we did all self peer manager
reviews by end of day Tuesday they were
due and had to be done on Wednesday and
Thursday we did all manage error reviews
and by the end of Thursday those were
done and on Friday our HR team looked at
all the reviews made sure everything was
complete didn't any follow-ups filled in
any holes all employees were rated and
put into performance review buckets we
had HR office hours throughout the week
to answer any questions help people if
they're stuck and we turned into
something fun we had special lunches and
snacks we had a celebration at the end
of the week we were in it together and
we we treated it like we were shipping a
big release we were shipping performance
reviews and then the following week we
did calibration people got back to work
the HR team went through came up with a
budget a reward plan we notified the
managers of raises and bonuses and the
following week the managers started
delivering their reviews and so we took
this process and we condensed it down by
paying attention to what people were
already doing and then just owning that
and making it take a week instead of
having people do that over the course of
a month how did you get your CEO on
board because like I I get the
efficiency of shutting down the company
for a week to focus on this to go as
fast as possible so there isn't this
drag but at the same time like you have
stopped business for the company so like
what did the CEO have to say about this
yeah so this is why I said I recognize
the privilege of being the COO who's
responsible for the business operations
and the outcomes of the business but
here's the caveat if you look at your
data and everyone knows that your
company is essentially grinding to a
halt in the last five years that you've
been doing these performance reviews
proposing that it grinds to a halt for
one week is a hell of a lot better than
that grinds to a halt for a month and so
it is contrarian and it is edgy and it
is something that takes some
consideration but the reality is the
tradeoff of this one week is pretty good
compared to the trade-off that you are
silently making by having everybody do
it at their own pace I love that jar
like so I was just reflecting as you
were talking and ever since I started my
career that's how I did my stuff you
know because you're right it would be
like a three- week process to do all
these things and people would do
intermittently and it'd be kind of
unorganized and I've always blown
through it like I'm going to ingest all
this partly because I would forget right
if you kind of do half of it and then
four days later the other half you're
like I'm like I'm gonna I'm gonna
actually pay attention to this all at
once so I can reflect on it and not lose
things that's why I did it but then it
was all done in three days so I never
understood people were like well I can't
do it in two weeks I'm like that's just
a discipline problem that is that is on
you and you've basically stripped that
away from everyone and not made it a
problem because they have to do it like
that I I I love that because I do think
it is possible and the business has
always complained two weeks isn't enough
it's like well it is enough it's just
how you're working and my other
reflection was you know Nolan you said
you're basically shutting down the
business to do this I think the
difference for me and I talk about this
a lot with folks I work with is that the
people are the freaking business right
you don't have a business you have great
people that are doing well and getting
rewarded for doing so and so I think
what you've done as a business leader is
made that made this process a part of
your business it's like a business
initiative and you're totally right that
we can't do it on our own right like
that the Business Leaders should be the
mouthpiece of this or it changes the
whole game yeah I love that you
mentioned this idea that this is part of
the business and I also understand you
know shutting down the businesses and
we're not shipping we're not getting
things out to customers but there's a
theme in how I think about people
operations and you know obviously have a
very different background than a lot of
people that have worked in people
operations which is if you're not
modeling this treating these different
functions whether it's recruiting or
performance reviews or management or
incentivizing your team as something
core to your business when these are the
folks that are getting the most critical
strategic work done then there's
something far more important that you
need to fix in the business right and so
it is about starting to think about that
strategically and if we can do this like
maybe if you flip that you say it a
different way and you say hey Nolan I
can guarantee you that in one week's
time we can put a jolt of energy and
excitement and Clarity into our
organization we can help the people that
aren't performing to perform better and
we can reward the top performers and
really make them feel excited about the
work you like hell yeah sign me up right
and that's effectively what you should
be doing in a good process around this
and it's our biggest cost it's like you
know this this is our biggest cost in
the whole company let's take a few days
and pay attention to it and give it give
it give it a boost
well so okay I get I get it and I do
think it's like a it's a utopian that I
haven't heard described what's been
happening though in Tech is the move
away from performance reviews right so
Square last year with with Jack dorsy
was like we're no longer doing this like
this this process doesn't make any sense
what's your take on the company's going
like completely away from performance
reviews yeah I I think that it can work
but then you better have another system
for getting feedback out on a regular
basis and I think the downside of this
is that people don't think about the
introverts and the quiet ones and the
ones that don't have the skill set to do
that within their population they think
about oh I've got a few loud people that
feel really comfortable and unabashed
about the feedback that they want to
share they have no problem this should
work for everyone and you actually have
to design around the middle you have to
think about where are most of my people
going to be and then consider the edges
sure you've got these folks that you say
hey no performance reviews just give
feedback regularly no need to wait for
performance review process those people
are fine they're happy to volunteer
feedback sometimes too often then you've
got people at the other end who go oh
well if I'm never given permission and
I'm never given a space and no one's
here to help me in doing this I'm just
not going to share what I think and
that's a lot of people so as long as you
can design a system that helps those
people to make sure their feedback is
heard then that's fine and then you are
designing for the middle as well where
you're like okay these are people
somewhere in the middle so if you don't
have a solution for that going and
getting rid of something that works to
help those people is probably a mistake
if you have an alternative solution
great I think you should constantly be
testing and figuring out what works but
I I think there's this mistake people
make where it we do the same thing when
we treat our customers like they're us
right like they know our product as well
as we do and they're experts and they're
Pros on it it's like no they're not
right so like understand your customer
and this is your internal product right
so understand your internal customer and
make sure meeting their needs if not you
are going to be building in this
feedback vacuum where you're only
hearing from the vocal minority and I
think that's a huge mistake yeah I think
I Nolan I think it's like the baby out
with the bath water like I get getting
rid of reviews right but I think the the
the danger is the semantics getting rid
of reviews is different than getting rid
of what's necessary is the feedback and
all the things Jared's talking about I
think we get wrapped up in like the old
ways of what that word means it's kind
of like when shth on Allin podcast said
get rid of HR it's like that's great but
that work has to go somewhere and that's
fine if you want to put the work
somewhere but you can't just say get rid
of HR get rid reviews because what
actually is important underneath that
shitty term that we all have our own
biases what we think about is stuff that
actually needs to be there yeah you know
the thing for me is I I think it's still
in the oven like I'm still thinking
about uh different ways to do this I
love your take on it Jared because it is
unique and it is contrarian and I think
the problem with reviews as they've been
up to this point is like everyone
basically does it the same way with like
very slight variations and that's what
drives everybody crazy and so Jared the
thing that you said is testing we like
to use the term experimenting on the
show and I think like just the more
experimentation here is what's
interesting and so like stuff like yours
is interesting also stuff like squares
is interesting like I wonder if they
don't replace it with anything what
happens you know like what maybe maybe
the culture does shift negatively or
positively I think it's still in the
oven we're still in the early days of
toying with this but I'm very happy now
that people are actually trying new
things and no longer just like rinsing
and repeating what's been done before
let let's move on to I want to talk
about founder mode so Paul Graham had
the seminal piece you know about Brian
chesky coming in and and doing founder
mode it is all the rage right now what
is your take on Founder mode there's a
popular divisive narrative that things
like this are black and white that
you're either in founder mode or in
manager mode and I think the reality is
that sometimes you should drive the car
other times you should be the
passenger and other times you should get
in a different car and focus on problems
where you can have a bigger impact so
founder mode has a lot of Merit to it
obviously Founders have started these
companies and they have this secret
sauce and desire and Mission and passion
about it and that's so much of the magic
that makes the company successful in the
early days and the concept could easily
be weaponized to justify micromanaging
an entire organization which would just
be a path towards failure so there's
three things that I think about around
founder mode and to be honest this is
much broader whenever you're thinking
about borrowing someone else's idea or
something that worked at another company
I think you have to consider that
companies are not the same you know what
works at one isn't going to work at
another if you have 10 employees that
are working remotely and another company
that came up with this where it worked
has 200 people working in offices they
have different needs different friction
points and different approaches that are
going to work with that the second is
that Founders come in all shapes and
sizes and as amazing and talented as a
person is they're not Steve Jobs they're
not Brian chesky those are outlier
individuals they are their own thing and
so you've got to be honest with yourself
about what you're great at and you need
to lean into that if you think you're
better than everyone on your team you're
either lying to yourself or you should
recruit a better team and then lastly
there's a nuance and getting these novel
Concepts to work so you know when you
think about founder mode one of the most
important things is knowing when to get
involved versus not if you're involved
in everything you can't scale there was
a reason you went out and hired
Executives to begin with right it wasn't
because you had unlimited time otherwise
you would just keep doing it if it was
working so well you started in founder
mode most people left founder mode
because they ran out of time they had to
hire other people and then at some point
their mindset shifted so actually they
they didn't leave founder mode at first
they hired other people and they stayed
in founder mode and then somebody told
them hey you should really take your
hands off the Reigns now if they just
completely take their hands off their
Reigns and they're not involved there's
no checks there's no balances and there
tends to be a lack of cohesion across
their functions because they tend to
hire functional experts so people need
to be mindful of this right you've got
to be involved in the places where you
can add value and your job as a CEO is
to keep sending that vision and to keep
uniting those different teams in those
functions to make sure they're going
towards the same objective but this
viral spread of founder mode reminds me
of what happened with Netflix's novel
idea to get rid of a set vacation day
policy and it actually speaks to all the
same things and I live through this
right I've been at multiple companies
that have had this so one companies
aren't all the same when you think about
when Netflix did this and they changed
their policy to be unlimited they were
relentlessly focused on Talent density
right they paid people top of Market
they were incredibly good at firing
people right so when you think about
this there are so many different failure
cases and one of those is well what
happens if people just take unlimited
vacation and they don't carry their
weight well at Netflix they did control
for that they would fire people and when
you think that's actually quite unusual
compared to Netflix most companies I
know you guys have Patty McCord on and
she talked about this she said most
companies care more about retaining
employees than managing them out they
about that as this success metric and
it's a major problem if their turn is
too high right so the pain of
documenting and managing a person out
and finding a replacement is just so
high that people avoid it and that's for
replacing underperformers whereas
Netflix famously wanted to replace
adequate performers they said even if
you're just meeting expectations if
you're not exceeding then they want to
get rid of you that second piece about
Founders is differing Reed Hastings was
an incredible founder he navigated
through so many different pivots in that
business and he was developing this
culture of transparency so if people
felt that they were going to burn out
like they didn't have permission to take
vacation he was pretty sure that he was
going to be able to hear about it and
what many people don't know is Reed Took
a ton of vacation himself which I rarely
ever see when I look at Founders today
and and lastly there's this Nuance in
getting it right so I have you guys read
no rules rules yeah yeah amazing book so
this is this story of how Netflix shaped
their culture and it's really incredible
there's a detail in this that didn't
quite follow the telephone game of this
vacation policy taking off which is Reed
and Patty thought it was so important
for them to model taking vacation so
they told all of their leaders you have
to take vacation and when you come back
scream it from the hilltops share your
photos tell everybody how great your
vacation is you have to model this so
that people have permission and that
they know they can do this so you can't
just copy and paste this into your
organization not do any of the critical
supportive things and expect that you're
going to be the exact same have the same
strengths and weaknesses as these other
Founders you've got to pay attention to
the details and make it work and if it's
a bad call you have to have the courage
to kill it hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metav view is the AI assistance for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
quora and check out medavie head over to
metav view. a/h Heretics to talk to one
of metav VI's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled in minutes
I love your take on businesses are
different you know one of the things
that I have realized over time is it's
not just you know the leadership
differences it's not just like stage and
size differences like business models
actually drive different sorts of of
business decisions and people decisions
if you work in a B2B SAS company with
margins that are in the 80 to 90% versus
an operations company to where margins
are much much lower it's just so
radically different how businesses
operate and I think when people are
designing people policies I I've made
this comment before everyone looks at
Google and they go oh it's like well
Google did this and it turns out you
know it's the best Monopoly of all time
they can do whatever the hell they want
to do and I think a lot of times people
don't take into the consideration set
like what exactly does our business need
and what can we allow given those needs
yeah I I thank you Jared that was that
was great that's my biggest fear about
these things whether it's the founder
mode kind of taking off and I feel like
some of it's like a bad game of
telephone now and it's like gotten so
far away from where it started and we're
going to actually have Ian on from
Airbnb and then Patty as well right
Patty and I are close we go back about
 
stories she always says is you know I
work with all these companies and
they're like your culture deck I want to
implement it here exactly how you had it
like make it happen and she's like bye
stop you know like who are you what is
your business what do you do like all
these things are important and so I
think this copy paste on these these
things that people say playbooks are
best practice it's just silly there is a
there is a Revolt though happening on
this like highlevel manager who only
manages and I I think that's the essence
of of Paul Graham's piece is that the
the person who operates in the Ivory
Tower only and never gets to the lowest
level of detail is the problem Kelly you
and I were slacking this morning about
uh my friend Tyler Hog's piece which
we'll talk about next week on the show
but there's just this like I think we've
been coded to think like oh the person
who you want to be is the exec and the
exec what they do is they fly around at
 
strategy they never get to the lowest
level of detail they never talk to
customers and in fact it's exactly the
opposite for the most successful people
yes they can fly at 70,000 feet but they
also dive into the dirt to understand
what's actually going on underneath the
hood yeah and that's where I think exec
that's the Revolt yeah sorry I agree and
that's where I think it's not just
Founders who need to be in this founder
mode sometimes to your point it's
everyone like we joked about this a few
weeks ago Jared we talked about the
founder mode is that it stopped black
and white which is exactly what you just
said a few minutes ago and we put the
words together I forgot what the word
was fager mounder but like they go
together and it depends and that's every
executive not just the founders yeah I
that's totally right when you hire
amazing people that are great at a set
of things if you go and you put a muzzle
on them and you say but just do the work
that I tell you and do it as I tell you
it and don't use your brain just use
your hand I I use this term of if you
treat people like wrists meaning I
imagine like hands floating in space and
they're not connected to a body or a
brain they're just wrists that are doing
work you're you're missing out on a lot
of opportunity with what that person has
experienced and there's a lot of valid
things in that that will inform and
hopefully improve your business right
you hired these people for a reason why
did you take them through an interview
if it was just about what they could
execute and so if you want their
thinking in your organization you got to
figure out a way to enable that and
you're going to lose your best people if
you don't give them any autonomy now
that said this isn't about saying hey
great like I'll see you at the quarterly
reviews good luck with q1 you know you
got to figure out a way to be in it with
them and to decide like how do I play a
role a supporting role in partnering
with them as a Founder where I get the
best of them and the best of me and I I
just haven't seen that many people that
are these professional managers in
startups like those people get turned
out pretty quickly right people hate
that in startups and so this isn't a New
Concept I mean I agree we shouldn't have
people that are just professional
managers that don't know what the hell
is going on in the organization but at
some point of scaling it was a long time
ago that your head of engineering was
the best engineer on your team and so if
they go in and they start correcting the
code and they're actually a far worse
engineer you're making a mistake around
that person's skill set now if they help
that engineer who's amazing at doing
their work and has blinders on to
understand how their work is connected
to the rest of engineering that's a
really good thing for them to do and
they have to understand to be able to
speak their language by being deep
enough in it and so it is finding this
balance yep all right let's let's
transition to age so Jared you know
Kelly and I were were execs at an early
age and so were you you were actually
often the youngest person in your org to
do the thing so you were an exec slide
at 25 years old you were a director of
Google at 26 A GP to venture firm at 28
what was that like and what did you
learn from it and what advice do you
have for other young professionals yeah
so it it's one of these funny things
where I think I spent most of my life
where I was younger trying to be older
and now I turned 40 this year and now I
feel like oh man now I'm at this like
magical number I was wondering like is
it old enough when I was 35 or you know
when I was 30 am I and am I adult now
now if I tell people that I'm that old
and uh now that I'm like yep no I'm I'm
at that point you know you're old now
correct yeah I have the I have the same
exact issue Jared I'm there I'm going
through it I officially made it which
comes with a whole set of other things
that you got to deal with but yeah so
it's really funny you know being the
youngest person around the table can
really work against you people are less
likely to trust you they're less likely
to come work for you they're less likely
to follow you into the darkness and I
generally had less experience and also
this funny naive thought that the people
with more experience had it all figured
out and this was so clear for me when I
joined Google and I thought man this
company has 60,000 people make billions
and billions of dollars like they must
have it all figured out and then you
look under the hood and you're like oh
they're also trying to figure it out
like the rest of us right nobody really
fully has it figured out and the danger
and thinking that way is that it creates
friction on trusting your instinct and
on pushing back and on trusting yourself
assuming that somebody else knows the
right way and so I think that that is
something that you have to tune into the
biggest mistake that I see young people
make is actually to allow their pride to
take over right so it's when they rebel
against this right way or against this
experience and you know you can
generally tell when ego is driving the
conversation and it's really offputting
right you just don't want to be in those
conversations and so I'm most inspired
by these young Founders and young
leaders who lead with self-awareness and
they really listen right like they're
trying to build trust and respect and
I'm inspired by that like I see them
comfortable stepping into vulnerability
knowing where to trust themselves they
own their mistakes they learn quickly
you know and they don't get too far over
their skis and so one way that I think
people can do this and for a lot of your
listeners they're out side of this
potentially but they're dealing with it
with a Founder who's 25 years old and
they're like man I've got this founder
who's really young and how did they do
this and my recommendation there is
building what I think about as a
personal board right these are trusted
mentors and advisors that you develop a
strong relationship with who speak your
language and will speak the truth to you
and the most important part of this is
that they're people that you'll listen
to right so that sounding boards ends up
being really critical because you're
navigating this thin line between
brilliant contrarian ideas and reactive
company ending decisions right and and
you need some set of people that are
going to say hey that that sounds good
or pushes your thinking or questions you
and inquires and helps you to get to a
place where you don't have the
experience to draw on it so they're just
helping you to think about it from other
perspectives and to consider things that
you have yeah what being being young you
know often the youngest in the room and
to be honest for me it was like the
youngest exec in the room and all the
rest of them were men so that was like a
double whammy which is interesting but I
think I think I would add to that like
if you're young and have great EQ it
could be a really big Advantage right I
think you touched on this a little bit
Jared right understanding the context of
when you're in reading the room you know
not being super aggressive or contrarian
like respecting kind of the the
background of things while pushing in
the right way and so having that unique
balance I think the EQ plus the young
age can actually be really helpful
because folks can often give you more
leeway they can sometimes trust you more
they can engage your curiosity and you
can ask more questions they'll want to
help and that's the my my experience as
far as you know being the youngest in
the room but I'm curious where do you
have any kind of gritty stories of where
that tripped you up did you step in to a
big pile you know when you were young
that you learned from quickly yeah I
actually so one thing for me that was
interes interesting is about a few
months after I joined the executive team
at slide we decided we were going to do
layoffs and I remember thinking huh like
H how do we do this like what's the
process do you get people in two rooms
do you send out an email do you make an
announcement there you know there's all
these things that to
consider and we got in the room and our
head of HR said how many of you have
done a layoff before before and I was
with a bunch of very what I viewed as
very experienced much older than me
Executives and I was certain they were
going to raise their hands and I was
going to you know listen to a master
class on how to lay people off in the
best way and almost no one in the room
had ever done it so I realized in that
moment like hey yeah I'm young and I'm
inexperience but there's all sorts of
areas that are new for each of us and we
actually did what reminds me of like
Thomas Crown Affair where there were all
these different rooms and all these
different conversations to try to do the
best thing for employees to try to be
kind and considerate and understanding
and supportive in how we were going to
do this and it's interesting to watch
over the last 20 years in in Tech of
people that have had to do layoffs and
all these creative ways that they come
up with it and some people get praised
for the thoughtfulness and other people
you know really get dragged through the
mud for how they didn't have that
thoughtfulness around it so I just
remember being in that moment and
feeling so so young and so naive and so
inexperienced and then having this
reality check of hey it doesn't matter
how old you are you're going to run into
those situations that are new to you and
every idea is a good idea and then was
an equal participant in designing how do
we do this and what is it that the
employees are going to go through and
how do we show up as a company to
support them yeah the thing that
happened with me that I experienced a
lot was I felt like everyone else around
the table had all the
answers and it got me into this mode of
I need to have all the answers
too and that was exactly the wrong
approach to take it turns out and in
fact like you know as I've as I have
aged I have learned that the smartest
people say I don't know but here's how
I'm going to go find out and you know
that's the thing I would just encourage
people who are young who are entering
leadership roles who may be the youngest
person around the table is that don't
get caught up in the the ego track
of looking around at your peers and like
oh my God they're so good at what they
do they know everything they have all
this experience like I need to fake it
till I make it I think fake it till you
make it is the worst advice that you
could give somebody because it's
inauthentic it's a veneer people will
see through it and you will have to live
in that body every day and living in
that body is so uncomfortable because
you feel like you're going to get
exposed totally agree with that I think
this concept cep of getting comfortable
listening and not knowing and being
vulnerable in that of going oh man I
thought it was my job to know and I
don't but I'm going to do something
about it right I it's totally fine to
not have the answer but you do need to
develop a plan or you do need to have an
idea or you do need to say I don't know
and I'm gonna come back tomorrow with a
plan and I think people get so caught up
in feeling this false like urgency that
they need to have the and it needs to be
perfect and they need to have it right
now I'd much prefer that they go and
think about it for a day and they come
back and it's like this Thinking Fast
thinking slow right so I I do think
people are getting more comfortable with
this but this whole like puff up your
chest and pretend like you have it all
figured out it is it's so see-through
and and people really don't realize it
and I couldn't agree more with you Jared
I have to ask you just to Pivot really
quick Nolan the the the founders you
coach right you're your coaching
practice now with founders
just working with so many Through The
Years what what's what's on their minds
now obviously
without you know exposing too much but
what are the themes you're seeing as far
as the anxieties they're feeling what
they're thinking about what they feel
good about just kind of want to dig into
that a little bit Yeah so I have a
really sort of strange coaching practice
pretty different from anything i' I've
heard of I mean the reason I went into
coaching was that I went looking for a
coach and I didn't find anybody who had
walked my on my shoes I I wanted
somebody who had done what I did and was
a little ahead of me and could be a
thought partner somebody that I would
consider putting on my board or being a
mentor or an adviser who could help me
and sure some days it was how do I
manage my stress and communication and
roleplay this with me and other days it
was should we raise money and should I
fire this VP and how should I think
about recruiting this person and how do
I get more out of this team and you know
what do I do in this sticky situation
right so it's all across the board and I
thought that founders probably just want
somebody in their corner and somebody
who's not incented you know somebody
who's not at their company with
territory and with things they're trying
to protect that's coming in and
influencing their ideas so I thought
okay how do I develop this coaching
practice to be there for Founders and be
in it with them regardless of what
they're up against and so what I get
exposed to is a really broad mix i'
would say one of the things that almost
every founder runs up against if they're
successful is that their role keeps
changing every 6 to 12 months the
company's bigger the things they're
dealing with are different they have
more experts in the room there's more of
this I used to be the smartest person at
this but now I hired a CFO and actually
like they're better at Excel and better
at financials than I am should I just
let them run the model but they're kind
of conservative and I I don't know maybe
maybe I should push the ideas a little
bit this like delicate dance of how do I
get involved with people that know more
and have more experience and are experts
in this but I have this like magic sauce
of context of this company and of all
the mistakes that we've ever made like
what is my role and and so you have
imposter syndrome and then you have this
question of scale and focus and that's
really hard because you used to be able
to know what was going on all across
your company because you all fit at one
table and then you fit at two tables and
then you fit in two different rooms and
then two different buildings and then in
two different countries right and so you
start to lose this context and it it's a
little jarring for most Founders right
they want to know everything that's
going on they want to be involved and if
you cling too tightly to that you end up
micromanaging and actually stifling your
company's speed and ability to run
faster right and you end up squeezing
these people that you hire who you hired
because they were so creative and so
capable but now you're like constantly
needing justification need to know
everything that they're doing versus
finding a way to get the information
that you need in a way that also works
for them so a big part of this is like
identity shifting what happens for
Founders as they're changing you know I
do a lot of strategizing around
fundraising and a lot of executive
hiring and layoffs right so how do we
message layoffs when do we decide to do
them when do we pull the trigger
something I know you guys are curious
about talking through is you know
getting better at hiring and better at
firing almost every founder I talk to
says that they fire too slowly says that
they wish that they would hire faster
and fire faster and be more decisive
around this and so for many people I'm a
sounding board right I'm a second
opinion where they go okay I'm thinking
about this but this is edgy you know
should I tell this person to go you know
pound the pavment or do I go with this
this is a big deal do I work on this big
BD deal it's really intoxicating they're
telling me they're going to pay me
millions of dollars but like I think
it's really distracting for the company
hey I have a co-founder dispute and like
I think they might leave where I I don't
know if I should still be in my role
right these are really difficult things
and your board and investors can feel
like your boss and so you don't really
have anyone talk to you can't talk to
people in the company right and so
that's where I think I have the the most
meaningful conversations and hopefully
can be the sounding board that help
bounders to get I I sometimes a CEO is
around an acronym for me of conviction
execution and outcomes and so I think
that that's my role it's to help see and
Founders think about this and to then
execute to hopefully Drive the outcomes
that they're Desiring yep you did
mention hiring and firing and I want to
quickly touch on that so you've worked
for multiple companies that have gone
through hyper growth um you know there's
a there's an aspect of like competing
and and winning the talent as part of
the recruiting process but you just
mentioned the thing that I know to be
true as well which is I think it's
probably of the Thousand managers that
I've interviewed 70% have told me that
their biggest regret is is moving too
slow on
terminations so talk me through how you
coach Founders on both of those aspects
so more broadly we talked about how
people operations and culture and hiring
envir all this stuff it it sometimes
gets bucketed into HR and I think we
have to be really careful about that
right like this is your internal product
and you got to have the same care and
craftsmanship for it that you do with
your external product so you to think
about the kind of company you want to
build the kind of people you want to
build it with and then regularly share
the why versus just the what that's what
helps your team stay align that's what
helps people understand what they're
trying to achieve so that in the
thousands of micro decisions that never
surface that they never talk about that
they're understanding what they're going
after in the trade-offs and making
roughly consistent decisions as to what
they would make if you had a
conversation about it so my guiding
princi around this is higher with speed
fire with respect and On hiring if you
see that it's hard for your recruiters
to get interviews scheduled with your
team or that people aren't promptly
putting things into your ATS I'm sure
none of you have experienced that then
your team isn't seeing recruiting as a
top priority and you've got to fix that
if you don't fix that this is just going
to be playing whack-a-mole every role
that you go to hire for you're gonna go
come on guys like we got to get these
interview schedule it's let me go ask
this permission okay hey you didn't put
your feedback like you interviewed this
person a week ago we can't move forward
we don't know what to do right you have
to inculture that that this is a
critical part of what you do and instead
of having the HR team take this on you
need to get your overall leadership team
on board they have to model this right
if your Executives think well I'm an
executive I'm too busy and I can't do
this they're just modeling to the rest
of the team that it's totally fine to
treat recruiting and hiring as this low
priority thing right this is one of the
most important things that you do as a
company so your employees are of going
to follow your functional leaders and if
you want to avoid this US versus them
that sometimes happens with HR you've
got to be in lock app with your leaders
so that HR is then seen as this
strategic enabling function versus one
that bogs people down with meetings and
process and and I get that that's easier
said than done but that's what I think
you have to work towards on the firing
side I think there are two things that
make companies fire too slowly the first
is fear of legal action what if we get
sued what if we didn't do all the right
documentation uh you know how many times
have you done all the right things and
then still had issues come up still you
know only twice yeah twice I've had this
happen a ton it's funny every company
I've worked at has had thoughts about
whether or not you know is is it okay
can we do this thing is it really okay
to finally terminate this person and in
many cases here come the lawsuits here
come the disputes here come the
settlements right and so that's when you
do it all the right way and what is the
real underlying cause to that and the
second thing that causes this is a fear
from the team about replacing the person
it took us forever to find this person I
really don't want to do that whole
process all over again so on on the
first part this fear of legal action
like I think it's actually work worth
looking at your true cost of a pit and
keeping someone who's underperforming on
your team now there's a balance in this
obviously you want to make sure you're
not just firing every person where you
get one complaint but once you feel like
hey this is somebody who's not
performing this is consistent that it
may be a mistake that now is when you
start the performance improvement
process and you just drag this out of
having an underperforming person there I
suspect that you'll actually save money
and improve your company performance and
reduce legal actions by packaging people
out on the second when you think about
this fear of replacing person well go
back up to hiring right the better you
get at hiring the faster you can lay
this fear the quicker you can replace
people that are actually going to better
suited for this role and so these things
are actually in together they need to be
treated in lock set if you have a
machine if I told you you could just
replace a person a lot of the fear of
firing somebody would go away but that
means you need to get really really good
at hiring and you got to be able to move
fast yeah I haven't I mean I haven't
personally experienced the legal thing
outside of a couple times I think that's
honestly if you do give people a package
which Kelly and I have actually been
talking quite a bit about recently one
of my big learnings recently is that
many companies actually don't give
people uh severance package when they
terminate and I think that does open you
up to more legal risk and one of the
ways that I've thought about solving
that problem is you give everybody a
severance you know small Severance and
treat them the way that you want to be
treated and then that way you don't have
to worry about that legal risk but just
on the hiring side Jared like I mean
most companies are terrible at hiring
and there's very very few that are good
and hiring we say with interviews all
the time it's super performative and so
I think a lot of times you just have to
be intellectually honest that even if
you are like serious about hiring and
you have all of your together that
the reality is is you're going to miss
and so the only thing that you can do is
get really good at firing because it's
just going to happen and you have to
solve those problems once they introduce
themselves into the company yeah we've
talked a lot about kind of the the do
everything right pip route Jared versus
the package route Etc and we can do that
another time but you said something fire
with respect and I think no matter path
you take or you know what not I do think
that things backfire usually when for
some reason sometimes it's valid and
sometimes it's not that doesn't matter
but for whatever reason the employee
feels disrespected and that's where I
think a lot of times things backfire no
matter what path it is yep that's that's
totally right Kelly all right jar I want
to hit one last topic with you so in our
prep call we talked about the honic
treadmill and I I actually think most
people are unaware of this concept cept
so can you explain to folks what the
honic treadmill is and how it shows up
in your clients sure so the honic
treadmill is a psychological theory that
describes how people return to a
relatively stable level of Happiness
After experiencing some change in their
life or an event and you know when you
give a great example of this is with
cash rewards and everybody has listening
to this has probably experienced this
and You' probably experienced this
yourself so you give somebody a bonus or
a raise you know what you get is this
bump they're happy for a period of time
and then there's this Decay and they
start to go back to whatever this
Baseline was before and this principle
doesn't actually just apply to rewards
it also applies to achievements and this
happens for both companies and for
people so a people you know a person
thinks that they want to become a
director or they want to manage five
people or they want a process to Run in
under 10 seconds or a company says I
want to raise 20 million bucks or I want
to get a million customers I want to
launch a second product doesn't take
very long that you start to make
progress towards that goal and all of a
sudden you set a new goal and this is
particularly true of ambitious people
and ambitious companies right they tend
to move the
goalpost and that means that you keep
yourself in this Perpetual feeling of
not enoughness that comes from not yet
achieving that thing that you desire the
greatest lie that people tell themselves
is I'll be happy when link right right
I'll be happy when I make $100,000 I'll
be happy when I hit this certain level
I'll be happy when I get married I'll be
happy when I have kids and then the
honic treadmill kicks in you hit that
goal you're happy for a period of time
and you start to go did I say a 100 I
don't know maybe 120 would be a little
bit better did I think kids would make
me happy I kind of miss my freedom I
kind of wish that I had a little bit
more time to myself that thing that I
used to not like as much I wish that I
had it so like this is so destructive
psychologically because it keeps you in
this constant state of being just shy of
Happiness so it's actually worse than
just being depressed you're constantly
feeling like it's in your power and
you're just failing you just can't quite
get there it's just Out Of Reach and so
there's an interesting study done by the
Journal of positive psychology on people
that focus on gratitude rather than
financial or material achievements and
they reported that they had Greater Life
satisfaction and reduce negative
emotions and unlike the satisfaction
that comes from accumul accumulating
wealth you know getting raises
accomplishing these goals gratitude
actually has a compounding positive
effect on your mental health so the more
you're grateful the more you think about
what you have the more you open yourself
up to the realization of that so I think
we can learn from this to have a balance
and a focus on both what we want and
what we have to take the time to
celebrate what we've achieved our
customers our impact and we can do this
as a company we can do this individually
and to dream about what the future holds
to set aspirational goals to try to
maintain a healthy perspective but to
hold the dreams lightly the minute that
dreams become expectations you'll sit in
a place of not accomplishing your dreams
and having that feel like failure and
instead what you want is for dreams to
stay as these amazing beautiful dreams
knowing full well that you're not going
to be able to accomplish all of them but
what a beautiful journey to be able to
try yep I it's it's so well said at that
gra gratitude is the the hack to getting
off of the honic treadmill the other
thing that I found really effective for
me is just remembering where you came
from and you know so you know all of us
have made so much progress we've learned
so much in our lives but we never
reflect back we're always looking
forward and I know a lot of people
believe in ripping off the rear viw
mirror and for me like the rearview
mirror has actually been really helpful
in anchoring myself and like this is
we've come a long way and I think other
people as I've talked to them about it
too when they do think about gratitude
for what they have and where they came
from it appears to be the antidote to
getting off the treadmill 100% it gives
you perspective right and so there's a
reason we do Retros the reason we do
look backs and Reflections like all of
that helps you understand where you are
if if you don't understand where you
came from you can't really appreciate
the distance that you've traveled and so
I I think that's incredibly important
yeah Jared this was a blast thank you so
much for the time man thanks Jared thank
