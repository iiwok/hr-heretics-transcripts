# Navigating the CEO-CPO Relationship with Cara Brennan Allamano of Lattice

## Transcript

 
all relationships are a set of chips
you're putting on a table and then
you're removing and you're cashing in at
different points right like like yes
that is always the equation that you're
you know managing in your head the
biggest challenges I've seen where I've
had an HR leader really have trouble
with a CEO is because it wasn't a focus
on that relationship it was a focus on
the job or the brand which was a
trade-off they may have decided to make
but I always encourage people if they
want it to be a longterm job like use
all of your spidey sents and go in hard
with the leader that you're going to be
partnering

with hey everybody welcome back to the
HR Heretics podcast where we get into
the real talk of company construction
these are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and board members behind closed doors
we're Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially
with people but on the show we tell the
truth and expect the same from our
guests this week's guest is Cara Brennan
Alano I love talking with Cara Nolan we
go way back I've known Cara for years
she's had an amazing career that I
admire she was at Adobe in the early
days Pinterest then moved on to Planet
as their vice president of people up to
udemy and now to Lis so a big big career
in HR Tech as a business and a People
leader she's a contributor for Forbes
which is awesome and is a co-founder for
people Tech Partners which I am proudly
a part of and have been for years as an
adviser so she's done it all one of the
reasons I love this conversation is
because Lattis has an amazing culture
and Cara talks about who actually owns
culture and a big hint it's not just her
it's everyone in the company we also
talked a bit about when Cara says no and
specifically saying no to her boss the
CEO when she should be pushing when she
shouldn't be pushing and how she
navigates some of these really tough
gray areas that all cheap people
officers have to navigate I'm so stoked
for our audience to listen to this
episode you're going to learn a ton from
Cara she's also one of the most fun
entertaining guests I think we've had
great sense of humor and a great outlook
on this role without further Ado here's
Cara Cara thanks so much for joining us
welcome to the show glad to be here how
do you you and Kelly know each other oh
my gosh oh my God it's one of those
things where someone asks you and you're
like I don't even remember you're like
well that's a good thing Kelly this is a
thinging with HR people we just
especially in Tech It's a Small World
the great HR folks that are kind of I
don't know Nolan wry here the envelope
pushers they just do big things and then
people Tech partners and it's it's been
so fun to watch you You' crushed it you
know what's so funny is and I'm sure you
get this Kelly you're a legend and
people are like oh how did you do it and
what's your strategy and how did you lay
out this path for better for worse a
couple of my inherent character traits
are uh I have very low tolerance for
pain and I'm a little bit lazy I think
so you know what does that lead to that
leads to wanting to work in jobs where
I'm enjoying myself and doing cool
things and putting myself in a position
where I'm in places where I get a lot of
energy and doing cool things like
building and being around cool people
like Kelly and learning those are all
things that give me energy and I found
that if I don't do those things then I
can be miserable faster than the normal
human I think so you just learn it you
low tolerance you said low tolerance for
pain most cheap people officers have
high tolerance for pain I I agree and
and I think that sometimes we don't
serve ourselves super well in a
profession when we tolerate and see
ourselves in some ways as sort of
Warriors when in reality I think if we
see ourselves as just another employee
that's trying to do our best and have a
really good employee experience and
expect our leaders to sort of rise to
the occasion when we are in that place
for ourselves and and I've had to learn
this too right I've had to learn it too
but when we live that it it tends to
work out better for everybody totally I
mean you you wrote that article right
Forbes right we we tend to step into
this position and accept it of being all
things to all people and then what
happens everyone's like well you're
going to that's your brand you're going
to fix it all you're going to do it it's
like listen I am one part of the Cog I'm
an employee also Let's go people and
that expectation setting maybe we could
talk about this because when I was 22
starting this way different than now
where the first thing I do is say listen
here's here's what I do I don't own the
culture right oh my God right and by the
way that doesn't allow for other people
around you to rise to the best work that
they can do and you will never succeed
in a world where your job is to keep
people happy
because whether we like it or not I'm
not capable of that Kelly I don't know I
don't know that you are the other thing
is we are we are the epitome of what got
you here won't get you there from a
professional standpoint what is rewarded
and what we do at early in our careers
is really about a lot of of keeping
people happy really being able to be in
the trenches feeling like you are of
service which I think is really
important and that's what excites me
right like seeing working through other
people if you don't get excited about
helping other people be successful then
like this isn't the career path for you
because that is all that this ultimately
offers at the end of the day but in
order to be of service at the CPO level
or the highest level of an
organization this is where it takes lots
of boundaries lots of Ruthless
prioritization really strong
Partnerships with with all of your
stakeholders and it is a it's a
different skill set than often what will
get you there when we step into that
place of
prioritization of boundaries of of clear
articulation of our value and and what
what we can prioritize for the
organization and for ourselves it takes
a lot of courage and I'm still working
on this piece too but but you know it
came up earlier this year an example is
we've been having a lot of conversations
about in office remote hybrid and it's
been a tough Year we're trying to drive
efficiency and effectiveness at lattice
just as much as anybody is and and so
we're having open conversations across
the organization about what's working
what isn't working does being in the
office make more sense and I talked with
my team I talked with other chro that
were going through their transition of
bringing people back to the office and
how they were managing it and I'll tell
you the number one message I got across
the board was oh my gosh it's a lot of
work like this is not something where
one day you say you got to you got to
come back into the office and then a
week later everything settled down um I
had a friend who who recently uh I
wouldn't say rage quit but I would say
very quickly walked away from her role
at Apple after five and a half years
high level HR because she said her role
had devolved into a lot of passive
aggressively trying to get people back
into the office and so I'm using this
because I think this is real for so many
people out there but this was a moment
where I had to stand and I did have the
conversation with Jack and I was like
look this is this is not going to work
at this point in time for the company
for us to try to put together a whole
initiative and deliver against a you
know a a shift in the location of our
work and I said I'm totally supportive
if we want to do this with different
teams or let different managers do it
but it's not something something I'm
going to be able to deliver as a CPO for
you at this time with the rest of the
stuff we have on board I'm really lucky
that have a CEO who listens and and
gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] enough to say okay I hear
that and let's talk about priorities and
I let's see see where this Falls but I
also know that in those moments those
are moments in time where the part of me
that loves to deliver and wants to be
the A+ student I had to say like no like
this isn't going to be it and I had to
know that if that doesn't work for lce
and that was a top priority for the
business that means that I'm not the CPO
that's going to do that and car were you
saying no from a business continuity
standpoint are you saying no from a uh
you know I'm worried that we're not
listening to our employees standpoint
like where is where are you saying no
and why yes and I think in general what
I would say functionally and stepping
back is I think that I did not want to
be one of those leaders that had
underestimated the change and the and
the amount effort that it takes to do
this the right way and so I think I had
one of our values at lattice's Clear
Eyes and and I wanted to I wanted to be
a person that had Clear Eyes about what
this actually takes to do it well um and
at that point we hadn't done the work
around listening to employees I knew
that if we had committed to that we
would get to a place where we'd be
listening but um but we didn't even get
to that part of the conversation because
it was just a a hard-nosed
decision not not to move forward because
of the level of work that it would take
and we just didn't have the bandwidth
car that moment you said listen no this
is going to take like there's so many
examples of of HR leaders even Chief
people officers that are really
opinionated ended up saying yes they
become the
mouthpiece of whatever the CEO kind of
wants and it spirals from there like how
how do you get to that point where with
with your CEO where you can just say no
right that just can't come out of
nowhere and do you worry about
him being upset about that later on like
it like does he really actually want
that to be the case and he it's less
about him being uh okay with the
decision you made and more about him
being talked out of it in the moment um
I think those are all super questions
and I agree with you Nolan I think I
think that is a tough call because you
can't predict the future and all
relationships are sort of a a set of
chips you're putting on a table and then
you're removing and you're cashing in at
different points right like like yes
that is always the equation that that
you're doing that you're you know
managing in your head when you're when
you're doing these things um I think I
would go back to just a fundamental
exper fundamental reality is
that in order to do a good job as a
people leader you have to have that
relationship with your CEO and it it's
taken me you know this far in my career
to truly understand that at a deep level
and I think especially in high growth
technology companies you have to
understand what what you can do and what
you can't and be prepared um be prepared
for whatever that means and know that
that any any moment is going to be a
trade-off between what you're able to
deliver and the resources you have and
and the resour ources you don't so um
Jack and I had had a lot of
conversations before this and and I was
really lucky and and I think I oh lucky
I'm extremely intentional about the
organizations I join and and knowing who
Jack is and knowing that we're
fundamentally aligned and him knowing
that I wouldn't say no unless I really
felt it was not good for the business
and not good for employees um but it's a
constant negotiation right like you're
constantly deciding what am I going to
put myself out there for and what am I
not
hey everyone we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors

Ops go to market engineering and finance
challenges so check out Continuum in the
description below ping me on LinkedIn if
you have any questions or head to join
continuum. Cara how do you pick the
right CEO to work with that can be such
a circus and very confusing I your
answer here too on this I mean I'm happy
to but like you you've you've joined so
many great companies had a great like H
how do you pick them I mean they're
they're picking us obviously but 100%
And I feel like a lot of HR leaders they
they don't realize that half the battle
is also picking them it's not just you
getting picked but how do you pick what
do you look for I think the shiny object
syndrome is really tough especially in
Silicon Valley um I
think because there are so many hype
Cycles constantly that it's really easy
to get caught up with what that could
mean mean for you in your career to get
a brand name that everybody reacts to
one way or the other and
financially and financially right like
this is generational wealth that you're
opting into or not like so I think first
of all is really a grounding and
understanding like how do you build a
long career and then I've also had
people that have said I'm not I I I'll
take it like I'm I had a friend that
joined Uber and was like I know that
this and by the way Kelly like Nolan we
know if it's going to be a dumpster fire
way before anybody else does right for
sure well you know the front page news
is all rainbows and sunshine but you
know you have two or three HR friends or
folks on the VC side or even
recruiters um who who give you the
inside line and I've had plenty of
friends that have been like I know in a
year and a half this is going to be a
super not you know I may walk away but
I'm going to walk away with generational
wealth and I will have done the best I
could in this year and a half and
boom I also have friends that are
executive recruiters that told me um
after last year's crash that there was a
little bit of remorse in in in their
minds um two separate Z recruiters which
is hilarious to me we're self-reflecting
and say damn I I sold some HR leaders
into some jobs that even I knew probably
weren't going to be the best thing for
them so you don't agree you don't you
don't agree with the path of hey this is
going to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show for a year and a
half two years I might hate my life but
I'm going to make a lot of money trap
trap trade off's not worth it I think
you have to ask that person because I
actually have friends on on all sides of
that I had some friends that were like
that was the worst X period of time in
my life life but here I am and I'm you
know doing my thing and I feel like it's
it's reasonable I have other friends
that they're their path is different and
they want to build something different
so I think to answer your very first
question and I'd love your perspective
on this Nolan from the recruiting and
and and uh Talon acquisition side but to
answer your first question I think is
understanding what is your goal with
this particular role and if your goal is
really longevity and building that
career over time it is only a about that
trust and relationship and it is not
about the shiny object and coming to a
place where you're like I care about
that CEO human and then I understand
that the rest of what's who the board
members are and then the executive team
um that becomes an easy thing for for HR
people to to do because we do know how
to opt into talent and how to identify
Talent the biggest challenges I've seen
where I've had an HR lead
really have trouble with the CEO is
because often because it wasn't a focus
on that relationship it was a focus on
the job or or the or the brand which was
a trade-off they may have decided to
make but I always encourage people if
they want it to be a longterm job like
use all of your spidey sents and go in
hard with the leader that you're going
to be partnering with tell us about the
interview process then with Jack and how
you specifically vetted the relationship
with him um I have the privilege of
knowing Jack for a long time so I think
um ja Lis was a people tech company
people Tech Partners company I also
within the ecosystem had a lot of people
that knew Jack um and Caitlyn Holloway
who's a friend of mine also had a strong
relationship so you know there is
there's there are very few secrets and
very little secret sauce in this a lot
of it is like ask people that know this
person if they are you know hitting the
mark on on X Y and Z what you're looking
for and then what I know a couple things
that um are really important to me that
Jack really clearly displays are um
first of all is a level of Integrity as
a leader um and he's made some tough
calls but everything it he leads with
thoughtfulness and and good intention so
that matters to me um from a human
perspective
and I also learn professionally that
that makes my job a lot
easier so again that goes back to my
laziness but um but there's that um and
then he's a good listener and he really
you know I I have the privilege of being
part of this this meta situation where
he's served HR leaders through lattice
and and and the product that he builds
but um you know inherent C curiosity and
and leading with with with um really
strong listening and and seeking to
understand um I I think those are the
best leaders or at least those are the
best leaders for me there are other
folks and and other cpos that look for
other things yeah yeah I think it can be
it can be dangerous right cuz I mean
when I was younger it was about hey
there's this job and there and and I'll
be honest I didn't really think
about can I live with this person for do
I know this person like what the hell
like you're you're excited about the job
you're excited about the challenge and
then you get like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I yikes
well I wonder Kelly you're bringing up a
good point though which is I I think
earlier in your career the trade-off
might be worth it if the opportunity is
big enough for you to grow and then
later in your career as you've been more
successful you can be more
choosy yes
and that can hit a certain point right
you know young 30s and and it's good
because you learn what you want to
tolerate and what you can't or won't you
learn who you are and I'll be honest now
I don't care really what the company
does I don't care if it's a widget a
service a freaking John Deere I don't
care what it is who are the people are
they trying to make the world a better
place and are they trying to create a
great environment not just at work but
but for right their their their people
overall and that is something that
especially in Silicon Valley you can
miss it and all the hype of all this
stuff he you come up with your list of
non-negotiables absolutely I didn't know
what those were back then we really also
in our role in HR I mean there's so many
interesting things to think about but we
really have the Paradox of choice right
in the sense that we can work in any
industry for the most part we can work
for any kind of company I've worked
across mtech and adte and space tech and
edtech and people Tech right like what
like that's nuts right on the other hand
it doesn't doesn't require us I believe
it doesn't ask us to be as
intentional throughout our career as
many as many leaders who are saying okay
I'm going to be a marketing leader which
means really deep understanding of this
particular vertical right so we're not
rewarded for that we're not necessarily
rewarded for that and I think in some
ways because many of us are people
Pleasers and our goal is is really to be
of service those things really crash
together and can be tough if you don't
get to a place like Kelly did where
you're ultimately like it's really about
the work um and and what works for me
yeah the biggest piece of advice I give
because there's a lot of you know young
up and up incomers now right we old and
crotching out thank goodness so there's
a lot of like the new 31y olds that are
like I want to be in the top job I'm
like good God why do you want to but
they're like well what do you think I
said look I what I what I would tell you
is what I wish I did is is try try not
always but just try to at least talk to
three to five companies before you jump
to the first one that comes at you
because they do come they come fast and
it's this sexy series B CPO and you want
to jump I'm like just find three more or
find one more
um kind of like right Nolan what we say
to recruiters don't hire the first
candidate I talk to five like it's
similar and and I I really didn't do
that early on yeah what Carol what I'm
taking away from from your relationship
with Jack is you can't replace time and
then you're leveraging your network for
deeper insights than what you can gain
during an interview
process and I don't think I don't think
people do that especially that second
piece of like really going deep it's
almost like back channeling who you're
going to work for and the same way that
they're going to back Channel you yes
yes I would agree 100%
I will pause it that I think the CPO job
varies probably the greatest as well so
part of what I want to do and what I
love you and Nolan are doing here and
what I think we need to do more for each
other from a professional standpoint is
we have a lot of people that will speak
for us we have CEOs that tell us what
their cpos should do we have Consultants
coming in saying C you know your HR team
should do this we literally in like the
last year and a half are just starting
to have the conversation ourselves and
be like I know I know it's crazy
somebody else need say the words for me
right and like we can actually help each
other and open like open this thing up
and be transparent but like I I will say
something and someone said this to me
like a year ago or so is there there was
always this like really odd Vibe of like
I don't know if it's competition or like
what are you doing and like I never
cared about that like tell everyone send
them the decks like do you think that
like is out there I feel like it's
breaking because for
Better or Worse we're all like at the
end of our rope and like it's been a
tough 3 years and we're all kind of like
just kind of too tired to do but like
what is that like Vibe out there you
know what I what I'm seeing and and I'll
be 100% real here is I think that there
were people like you always out there
that would send over the deck and would
pick up the phone I have you know a
growing list of people like that who
were always the people that that it's
not about competition and it's not a
zero sum game what I've seen in the last
year and a half is those are the people
that are rising to the top those are the
people whose careers are taking off
those are the people that for better for
worse survived the Last 5 Years and
didn't have all the you know we have so
many people that I've just had to tap
out for a while and I say that with
hesitance because there were also
wonderful and amazing people leaders
that that needed breakes so that's not
it but the people that I've seen really
continue to push the en envelope in like
this moment in time when our job I I I
posit is the most important job in the
sea suite and I will always say that now
those are the those are the people that
are winning and they're winning because
they have all the best information in a
time where the currency of how people
figured out covid and how you're doing
back to office and what systems you're
choosing what Innovation like that's
that's the currency of our jobs right
now that's what makes us successful yeah
and if you're a Founder CEO I mean I
want someone next to me that has all of
that stuff all of the networks all like
all the power in a great way but never
ever wants to use it for their own good
like that is the magic is someone who's
just toally a baller and doesn't really
care and doesn't want alistic and they
don't they're in the seat they don't
want to be in the seat like it's it's
the best uh yeah it goes against it goes
against human nature but they're
altruistic like the best people are
altruistic car I'm curious what do you
think about this trend of leaders coming
outside of HR into HR and why do you
think that
is well I
think um a couple things of the why I
think the role has gotten a lot more
interesting and a lot Meier and a lot
more complex and a lot more
sophisticated lately so I'm not
surprised that and by the way Kelly a
lot more
sexy um in the last five five to seven
years um so I'm not surprised that that
there are more people who are interested
in it I think um there really smart
motivated ambitious people want to be
where the key decisions are being made
um and I do think that's the people's
side of business I think it's paying a
lot better now all of the indicators are
saying you know the HR profession is is
a very fast growing um and and
compensation wise as well I agree quick
one on that the comp the comp piece for
cpos has skyrocketed to your point what
one piece of advice for our our next
Generation interviewing for this
role what's the biggest lever to dig
into ask for Nolan you you as well that
maybe you both learn from or I have too
what what do we miss in comp
negotiations for the CPO role CU we do I
agree that we do I think we miss asking
the question like so fundamentally basic
um but but knowing the data and and
asking for 10% more than you were
offered 20% more the worse it could be
is no that's a good point and then you
can still decide I I also would say that
 
people
related and so
tying that reality into the discussion I
think is is really important I think a
big reason it isn't as high as other
Executives though is because a lot of
people leaders aren't tying their
decisions to business
outcomes and that's going back to the
question I actually think I was going to
say going back to your question that's a
big reason that's a big reason why I
think a lot of non-hr people are now
getting into the seat and a lot of CEOs
are asking for non-hr people because HR
has come from this lens that's been
employee focused versus business focused
that's my take on it care curious to
hear your take I actually agree and
disagree um and I was talking about this
with a with a cohort of
chro two weeks
ago
um I think folks that have only had the
experience of up and to the right
particularly in Silicon Valley in
HR
underserved this last year has been
brutal for HR leaders you know I've I've
been on the phone calls with with tears
and and folks that I know are amazing
people leaders but if you haven't been
asked to manage through a layoff if you
haven't had to face the squeeze of
budgets and Effectiveness and efficiency
drivers and you haven't had to talk
speak really strong business alignment
um you do feel helpless in those
scenarios because your heart is with
your employees and the absolute worst
thing you would ever have to do as a as
a people leader is is ask people to
leave your organization involuntarily
like that sucks let's just call it what
it is so you want to know personally and
within your team that you as a leader
are doing absolutely everything you can
to make the right business cases the
right business decisions either to to
justify and make sure these folks can
leave with dignity and knowing that this
was the right decision for the business
and prevent this for the future right
but if your only experience which is not
anyone's fault in and of themselves but
if your only experience has been up and
to the right you are unprepared for that
you are unprepared to sit in that seat
um and and have to make those really
tough calls it doesn't mean you can't
rise to the occasion and you can't learn
and grow and get the right advice but
you are fundamentally underprepared for
what we're asking you to do I have been
through two other downturns before this
and I know how miserable it is but I
also feel prepared um at the level in
which I'm operating so what do I think I
think I think I sound like a very old
lady when I say this but I think this is
going to make all of us better because
on the other side of us and I do know
it's going to be another side Kelly
we're going to have an entire cohort of
people leaders that are just going to be
super badasses because they will know
business they will know how to M
navigate Effectiveness is an efficiency
they will have passion and confidence
around that and they'll know what really
good looks like and what it's like when
you have an infinite budget and can do
whatever you want on the Innovation side
right that's a great lens that's such a
great lens because the last 12 years
made us soft because we didn't have to
deal with a whole lot of adversity I I
think you I think you just nailed that
Cara on the layoff piece you guys did a
layoff in the last 12 to 18 months right
yep we did in January and actually
Jack's note went viral um the not where
he he articulated our our our approach
there so it's November now I keep
hearing from companies that have gone
through layoffs that their their
employee happiness is
that employee produ productivity is up
curious what you guys are seeing after
that you know we we keep a close track
on on where our employees are um we the
good news is is um as a
company we didn't take the hit that some
of the that some other folks had we had
a terrible layoff and it was awful um
you know 10% plus of our
employees um I do you think the
thoughtfulness and the communication and
the and the transparency that you drive
during those processes help on the other
side right because you're you're dealing
with two cohorts of folks that are
affected those that are staying and
those that are going um so so I think
the fact that that was managed pretty
well helped us so we didn't see a lot of
the the low lows and then the high highs
I think I think it's great that people
have have rebounded to whatever Lev
level they are but talk to me when it's
a another six months because I care
about employee sentiment over time
because that tells me really how well
you're doing I think when you see a lot
of um variation that tells me people are
still sort of settling and figuring out
what the what is so so while I feel like
we're in a good spot um we have leveled
out we were never like I said low low
high high we're we are in a healthy
relatively healthy spot I have I have a
quick I'd love your take on this so
Colleen's episode I don't know if you
listen to it Cara we talked about a bit
about layoffs and ructions and force and
an noan I'm going to um try and remember
this from memory but we talked about the
how and use examples like Twitter right
and and how they did that versus say
maybe how I'm assuming lce did it and
you know my friend Nolan's like people
will be fine it doesn't matter and I was
like dude it does [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter and I
would love maybe you know and you can
jump into obviously but it does matter
right but we were talking to be specific
we were talking about rolling layoffs
and I said I used to believe rolling
layoffs were a like a death spiral for a
company and what I learned from Twitter
is that's not the case right people are
fine and the company is fine and people
who want to work at Twitter are now very
much opting into that for better or
worse whatever we think I don't think
matters it's very clear now what their
brand is and the type of employee
they're attracting that's that's what I
had said Thank you and I and I do not
like I just advised a company two weeks
ago I said please do anything you can to
avoid rolling layoffs so yeah um well I
think it depends on the company you want
to build and the outcomes you
want
I think that um a my personal belief and
my experience and actually what the
research tells us is that companies that
care about company performance and care
about people are the ones with the
strong EST outcomes and I think you have
to have that level of Northstar when
you're going through um a layoff and my
number
one request my entire team is we lead
with dignity here so if at any point in
time like there's a million moving Parts
when you're when you're having to manage
through something like this you're going
to have a ton of decision points at at
every level um we always lean on the the
dignity um of of our employees at that
point
I
think also Peak you know Peak behind the
curtain here we did have folks we had
investors that told us make this
decision you've got three
weeks and um this needs to happen so
make it
happen it was another moment where I
said 3 weeks is not
enough and I'm and the answer is no and
so what we did is we spent more time I
believe that especially for the you know
if you're going to if you're going to do
a layoff right whether it's 10 people or
 
six weeks and I always add time on top
of that because I
believe executing and at this level and
doing the right things takes time and
effort and I I would I would venture to
say and these are the conversations I
had with C cpos across the board and and
time is a luxury right I I totally
recognize that but there were a lot of
chro cpos heads of people during the
time and and still are that are put in
situations where they just don't have
the time to do it the right way and I
think
Nolan what I would say for Rolling
layoffs or any type of exit whatever
you're doing be thoughtful about it and
know that you're making intentional
decisions instead of just trying to be
reactive to the moment and that's of
true no matter what I think we're
anchoring on a layoff because it tends
to be the extreme but this is where you
have to you have to know where you stand
you have to be ruthless with
prioritization and you you have to know
what it takes to do a good job I love
your take around it's the company that
you want to build and how you handle
these situations is reflective of that
and is Illuminating not only for your
current team but also future employees
 
screw-ups here
um in the spirit of learning heard that
heard it well God bless right we all
totally any any any kind of big ones you
can remember through your career advice
for the audience on on scaling on this
role on any of
it um you know taking full ownership
myself I think there were definitely
points of time when I I didn't say no
and I tried to do too much and
um you know to give specific examples
around that I I think early in my career
I was not thoughtful enough about the
effort of my team and like I would push
hard and then they would push hard and
then I think a lot of times that leads
to not the level of Team cohesion and
and outcomes that that is most helpful
and the good news is many of these folks
have for given me for
 
it but you know I think about one of the
very first performance review Cycles I
pushed out at Planet Labs was like come
in everybody was asking for it we needed
it and so we pushed it out and damn I
wish I could do that again it was one of
the first things that I did when I got
there and it was sort of like botched
and you know the coms weren't where they
were so you had 7 % of the org like get
it and the rest not and so you're
cleaning that up for the next four years
that I was there remember that remember
when we had a really bad performance
review cycle and nobody knew what to do
yes I remember that for four years for
four years I remember that and then
maybe you know maybe subconsciously I I
I'm here at lattice to to pay to pay on
the payback to to fix fix but I think
you know those bricks are those bricks
are so important early on you just kind
of again this role should be one of the
most highest paid I mean things that
you're doing they last years I'm like no
wonder series a Founders are now just
shelling out 300 Grand to have one
person take them through right it's like
build your house right from the
beginning it is the be you know what the
best part of that Kelly is is that 300K
for that head of people that knows what
they're doing is the board is demanding
it which is a hilarious part right
they're like you will write a
check there's no there there's no choice
anymore the pain is real I will sleep at
night Carol what I hear you say when you
say say no yes um what I actually am
hearing is it's not no it's just if you
want to do it right it's going to take a
little longer totally but I also want to
tell you Nolan it actually is no for me
and I'm I'm going to call I'm going to
call this out and I think this is you
know as a woman I actually really own my
no and and and hear me when and that's
what it is and it's hear me when I say
no and and it's yes and it will take
more and for my reputation and for
knowing what good looks like and
aligning with the good the answer is no
I'm not I'm assuming you're not using
that very often right no never very
rarely yeah cuz that's a card that you
can only pull a couple of times in a
relationship 100 % and and and God bless
I I do not spend I'm I'm giving you the
examples of the no because you're asking
but these are the these are the brief
examples of the no and that's the other
piece is when you when you know the
priorities and you're able to
consistently deliver when my team is
able to consistently deliver at a high
level and you've set and established a
bar then yeah people will really listen
when the answer is no because they know
that you're doing absolutely everything
you can to say yes most of the time what
is what would what would your business
partners say
about why is your team effective like
what in their words like what does it
look like for the business to have to
work with an Effective People
team um I think first of all they know
the business I I stand behind um
particularly the people partner function
that we you know across the board I I
don't want to minimize anyone on my team
I actually feel like they're all
extremely effectively business-minded um
business-minded HR people but what I
have heard consistently is they are
Partners in understanding the
Strategic outcomes that we need to drive
as a business and then we work backward
from there and that sounds pretty
obvious and sounds like it makes sense
and it you know it's simple not easy um
I think it's a really important piece
that not every HR Group can deliver
against I've referred to that people
partner function as a COO of HR yes yes
I love that COO of HR I love that Kelly
interesting I like that too um it is
there something around speed in today's
world cuz like I I feel
like the HR leaders I talked are telling
me there's immense pressure on them to
do more with less
faster I'm assuming your team's in that
mode right now
too you know what is also kind of
interesting to me and Kelly would be
interested both of you um in many
ways I'm having I've I've thought about
a lot of this right what are our key
priorities how do we do the work to get
to the outcomes we want it's interesting
to me that
a lot of what we know is right and good
about management and how to treat people
is
perennial hey I started my career in
newspapers of all places right and I had
a lot of a lot of salty folks in The
Newsroom give me a lot of platitudes
about people are ex and here's how you
manage and stuff like that a lot of it
was right right how you treat people um
I have a a CFO that I worked with that I
have a lot of respect for and he said
Bottom Line This is a guy i' worked for
 
respect they want to feel heard they
want to be respectful they want to be
considered 100% right so in some ways I
think I think we can make it harder for
ourselves on the people's side of
business I think I have learned to try
to cut through some of my emotion other
people's emotion not that that's not
important but if you really are wanting
to get to results it it may not be as
hard as we let it be and I say that and
this is sort of the shiny objects thing
because shiny objects happens inside an
organization as well as outside if
you're going back and you're saying how
do I help how do I ensure that people
feel respected how do I ensure that that
people are learning and growing in their
roles and how do I ensure that our
business is a la our our people
strategies align with our business
strategy like you start there and then
you're like how do I get there a lot of
that again is you know manager one-on
ones and um and great compensation
structures and philosophies and um and
employee surveys and good feedback and
this is where the B baring and stealing
right Kelly this is where learning from
each other and knowing what good looks
like and and making sure you're saying
curious is is really important and I
think sometimes in HR we spend a lot of
time sort of spinning on the new and the
next and the exciting and all this when
in reality it it is there's a lot of
Basics here and I think part of this is
because I have a master's degree in HR
and OD and nobody nothing in HR in my
Master's Degree was directly
applicable to my work right I second
that I second that 100% thank you very
theoretical we don't you know it was
great I love going to school I'm I'm
still going to school but there is not
that Playbook where you can go to school
and get it there is not we do not have
that structure professionally so we have
to do it for ourselves and those that
beg bar and steal win you have to learn
by doing 100% especially in these
companies that I mean we just they
change every 3 months I mean by the time
the playbooks you got to burn it
uh but the universal thread is the
basics right you can you can take those
Basics and run them through and then
tweak those for the Innovation like you
know go the inverse Cara how do you
teach and develop those in your team
what's one of the biggest things you
lean on to build your successors in lce
well first of all um they usually do
more teaching and developing
me so higher well higher well man like
I'm constantly amazed and it just have
been right and I think part of me is I I
have big eyes I look around and and I
don't I I actually don't believe a lot
in impostor syndrome and go you know
just stick with me but you know either
that or I'm so seeped in it that I just
can't see outside my bubble but I'm
constantly looking around being like
these people are way smarter than
me they know much more and so I just
asked ask a ton of questions and and why
do you think that way and conv just this
morning we were talking about goals my
team will appreciate this my leaders and
so so the very first thing to me and
what I just anchor on so deeply to the
point of annoyance is is structure
around um okrs and my my fundamental
belief is pick whatever it is V2 mom
okrs whatever your magical goal setting
spend a lot of time more than you think
you should in planning and alignment and
getting clear about what your core
priorities are and have a process in a
system to stick to that and then leave
people alone to do the work like talk
about the what and then let them figure
out the how and part of that is just
born like that's how I operate and so I
look for people that are smart that want
to bring their own stuff to the table
and that'll figure it out and then that
gets exciting for you as a leader
because you're saying oh my God I'd
never have thought about doing it that
way but literally just this morning so
we're doing our planning for next year
and my leaders had come up with a
measurement around attrition retention
and I'm extremely stubborn and I was
like I don't agree with this and I was
like hey you all did a great job but no
on this and then I get the hey it would
be great to chat about this in our
people leadership team I was like okay
they're not taking no for an answer
which is exactly what I want too right
you want good you want good
conversations around them
but um but being in a position where you
can be convinced otherwise and and and
it just like I I the it was an amazing
discussion I saw the thought process and
I was like man this is this is so right
on and I'm so glad you all came to the
table and push back and are are happy to
to tell me how I don't know what I'm
doing in this particular area you just
described an idea of
meritocracy I don't I I don't know I
mean at the end of the day Nolan I still
got to make the call but you're
right yeah but that but that's what that
is and I have found that truly what
smart people want is an idea of
meritocracy yeah I great that's it Nolan
that's what we
 
have let me ask you our rapid fire
questions I want to know who is your
best hire and why this is an easy answer
for me because with people Tech Partners
I hired my
sister and and talk about back channel
right
Nolan she's amazing and I had the
privilege of working with her so it it
that was an easy answer why because
she's the best um VP of customer success
that I've ever worked with and she leads
with passion so for sure that's dope
where do you where did you work with her
um I so I work with her with people Tech
Partners she's our oper operational
partner there mhm cool I love that okay
and then what is your favorite interview
question that gets you the best signal
on candidates I like to know why
somebody wants to join this particular
company why why this company instead of
all the others and for me because I
think it's a I like to test my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
meter and I think that one's a hard one
to to
you're either answering authentically or
you're not you either did the research
in work or you didn't yeah and I know
the companies that I work in are high
growth technology companies that you do
have to have a belief you have to be
able you have to internalize the reason
that you're here because it's hard right
and you have to believe you got to drink
the Kool-Aid you got to drink the
Kool-Aid it's so important you have you
you're right you do have to believe and
you have to believe in the mission and
you have to believe in the product and
you have to believe in the direction
that it's going because high-tech growth
especially in the last few years has
been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brutal brutal and we're
going to see another side to it and the
people that live to see the other side
are going to have the best stories to
tell and this is how there're like this
is why there's another side right
because it does make you better right
it's hard but you get a total other side
of the business and once you have that
 
people all day long I love that Cara
