# Andreessen Horowitz's Matt Oberhardt on Backchannels,  MOCs, and Exec Recruiting in 2024

## Transcript

 
we are honestly we're in a period where
you know people are getting sloppy with
back channels you know I'm sure we've
all seen it based on the phone calls
that that we get or emails they get we
get from people we don't even know
asking about somebody you know and
it's text whatever you know LinkedIn
messages all that it's just the the
biggest some of the biggest things I
tell our entrepreneurs don't cold call
into current employers only reach out to
people that you know well that are going
to you know probably give you good
information don't be out there carpet
bombing someone's Network to try to get
 
know it's just poor form and you know it
puts the candidate in an awkward
position makes you look unprofessional
and potentially poisons the whole
recruiting process honestly even before
you get to outreach I talk a lot to our
entrepreneurs about being precise like
what is your referencing

strategy
hey everybody welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast where we get into the
real talk of company construction these
are the conversations that happen
between Founders CH people officers and
board members behind closed doors we're
Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially as
it relates to people but on the show we
tell the truth and expect the same from
our guests today our episode is with
Matt overheart partner at injuries and
horites I've known Matt since 2014 when
I started at GitHub you know as GitHub
was backed by a16z and Matt was a talent
partner and we were hanging out all the
time he's just a great guy he loves
Pearl Jam and he's super talented at
what he does I met Matt in
 
raised their Series E which was led by
andrien and we were running to go to
market search and I was just astonished
with how much he knew about the lay of
the land for executive Search
how to think about executive Search how
to think about go to market what
candidates were available on the market
I just think Matt is like one of the
best search Partners I've ever worked
with yeah he is so strategic and calm
he's kind of like the Yoda who's seen it
all and is extremely humble at the same
time and on the show I love how he
talked about not just the search aspect
but how people grow and change over the
years you know with all his years and
and the industry and especially a16z and
seeing Talent just seeing how references
shift people change and that's why he's
so big on these Talent networks right
it's not just the search it's this
NeverEnding ever evolving process of
cultivating communities of people yeah I
think our audience is going to love this
episode because search partners are a
little opaque and Matt breaks that down
for us maybe my favorite part about the
episode was like how to tell a Founder
when they're about to make a mistake or
a bad hire for sure so I'm I'm super
excited about this episode I think our
audience is going to love this episode
uh please like subscribe share it helps
our Channel it helps us reach a new
audience and without further Ado here's
Matt Matt thanks so much for joining us
on HR Heretics how are you today doing
really well appreciate both of you uh
inviting me to join you so happy you're
here Matt so Matt you and I work
together a little bit when I was at
Carta uh you were kind of like the
shoulder I would go and cry on anytime I
would have some sort of executive level
problem or executive recruiting problem
and I I guess just kind of like starting
with where the world is today talk to us
a little bit about Ventures lens on
talent and how does how does like a
venture Talent partner assess Talent
yeah so I think you know it also it sort
of all starts with what your mission and
kind of what your role is and I think
you know the way that we're structured
over here is is somewhat different and
unique relative to a lot of the other
you know Venture Talent partners that
are out there and I talk to a lot when I
meet Executives for the first time I
often talk to them about this I'm like
hey think of me almost as you want a
talent agent rather than a recruiter uh
so I think you know our lens at least on
Talent sort of starts with that
differentiator you know so when we're
meeting um Executives or we're helping
companies we're coming at it from the
lens of honestly not being recruiters
we're coming at it from the lens of
being advisers we're coming at it from
the lens of being counselors so I think
that makes a huge difference in terms of
what our lens looks like I think you
know when we're meeting Executives the
differen is we're focusing a lot more on
their
intangibles um and their soft skills in
addition to their functional
capabilities because we're not really
meeting Executives and evaluating them
for a specific role we're meeting them
to kind of bring them into our Network
and be there as a resource to help them
um you know further their careers we're
not necessarily interviewing them for a
specific role in the portfolio so when
we're talking to Executives and
evaluating them it's a lot about EQ like
for example how do you take feed Feb
back you know what are the things that
you're aware of that might be your
personal triggers you know what do you
see as your interpersonal impact in a
room you know what sort of balance they
have between humility and you know
self-confidence a lot of those things
we're also looking at motivations
intrinsic motivations extrinsic
motivations we're doing a lot on
critical thinking like looking at their
analytical skills their business Acumen
skills we spend time looking at their or
Savvy their leadership skills all these
things that aren't necessarily role
specific but going to be a lot more
relative to who they are as an executive
and I think then that also plays in you
know look I've worked with both of you
when you were in the portfolio and you
know the conversations that we had were
always a bit more kind of strategic
around how to approach the role how can
we help the team get calibrated on the
role who are the best search Partners to
use and let then sort of letting you and
that search firm run with the execution
and we remained in that advisory
capacity kind of being there to help you
with you know with referencing
compensation guidance our views of
people that are in process that we know
that type of thing so I think you know
our lens on Talent is going to be a
little bit different because the role as
the the talent partner is defined here
very differently Matt what percentage of
time are you spending on external kind
of succession planning meeting new
Executives versus advising
portfolios inside people inside the
portfolio and how do you balance that
it's a great question I think probably
on average um over sort of the lens at
least it's probably about 40% with the
portfolio about 40% with the executive
community and then about 20% on the work
with the veterans community which you
know we can get into later but so if you
sort of look at portfolio versus
external in total it's probably about 40
 
you know in a given week it might be
 
following week it just so I think a lot
of it for us at least is you know we
measure a lot I'll put it to you that
way in terms of um
you know tracking how we're spending our
time and it's not it's not like we're
lawyers billing Out hours that's not it
it's more where are we putting our
energy are we putting our energy into
you know meeting new executives are we
putting our energy into sustaining those
relationships by being there to offer
counsel or introductions are we putting
our energy into you know being on search
for update calls so we have a lot of
different metrics that we you know track
internally so that we can kind of make
sure what we're keeping a good balance
and that there are certain parts of the
work that we do that aren't forgotten or
left behind you know In the Heat of the
Moment that's really interesting how is
your success measured yeah so you know
to get into some of the details on that
so you know we have all of us sort of we
we have you know metrics that kind of
roll up as a team but you know within
that set of metrics we have you know a
fair amount of flexibility and latitude
is kind of where we choose to spend our
time so for example you know when I
first started here back in you know 2012
there was a ton of energy being put
towards building a network of executive
relationships that um is now somewhat
more about sustaining those
relationships so the activity and
Cadence around that sustaining is very
different than it is when you're
building um you know we're also you know
measuring the activity with that Network
in terms of hey how many new execs have
you interacted with this year uh what
have you been able to do for the
executive community in terms of the
number of councils you've provided
number of introductions you've provided
hey how many you know search programs
have you worked on with the
portfolio um you know what's the value
you've been able to add there in terms
of hey you know on the search update
calls helping them with mocks beforehand
how many subject matter experts
beforehand were you able to introduce
all these different things that just
help us really figure out what works and
what doesn't work with the portfolio and
the executive Community but also is a
way to track the amount of energy that
we're generating um you know in terms of
our daily work and making sure that you
know we're getting done what we need to
get done yeah you you mentioned Mock and
Jeff stump is is one of the people that
I worked closely with when I was at
Andre and the mock is something I was
not aware of before I worked with you
all and it completely blew my mind I
think it's the best framework for
executive hiring that I've seen can you
just describe to mock to our audience
what it is and why you guys are so
passionate about using it well I think
look all of us have you know been doing
this for a long time and I think what
tends to happen sometimes with you know
position profiles is a couple things one
is they generally tend to kind of be
recitations of all the possible
responsibilities that could be
encompassed in a role and you know
there's never really any prioritization
put against well okay fine this you have
this huge long list what are the things
that you actually really think the
person should focus on and let's take a
subset let's take that subset and really
start to figure out how do we interview
against those really important items to
make sure that these people have the
competencies and experiences to do them
so so I think that's sort of the first
thing that you see with a lot of
position descriptions I think the second
thing you see a lot of times as well is
it's a rushed process and I think a lot
of times with entrepreneurs they always
you know whenever you start working on
something you automatically feel like
you're three or four months
behind so what we really tried to do
with the mock it stands for Mission
outcome competency what we really tried
to do with it was number one impress
upon the entrepreneur that let's try to
get in front of a need as far as
possible so we have the time to really
sit down with and figure out what's the
mission for the role what are the
outcomes you want to achieve with the
role and what are the competencies that
um will determine whether a person can
achieve those outcomes and I'll kind of
break this out bit by bit here so the
mission really is it's the elevator
pitch it's the one or two lines that
dictate exactly what you want this
person to really deliver at a high level
what is the mission of the role the
outcomes are basically six or eight
things that you want them to achieve in
the course of probably the first 12 or
 
competencies are related to what what
are the things this person needs to have
accomplished what are the skills that
they need to have that we have evidence
therefore they can actually achieve
those outcomes now the thing that you
see that's missing from this is a
recitation of responsibilities in the
job and largely kind of a recitation of
the type of experience a person has in
the role and we you know it's a
deliberate distinction because we have
found that you know unless you really
lay out what almost amounts to that
person's performance review in Reverse
which is the outcomes it doesn't really
matter what you list as the day-to-day
responsibilities because when you do
that massive recitation of day-to-day
responsibilities it doesn't come with
any prioritization and then you know
what happens so often is a person gets
hired off of that list of
responsibilities their onboarding is
pretty limited because in a startup you
know it's hard you know just to get time
to talk through these things so a person
might be in the job 30 60 90 days before
they have any sense from the CEO or
founder they're working for what the
actual priorities are that you want me
to get done out of this long list of
responsibilities if you lay out through
the mock process what the outcomes are
going to be you interview against those
outcomes to drive the competencies even
if there's some limited CS during the
onboarding process during the person's
first quarter on the job they still know
from the position description what the
heck the outcomes are that they're
supposed to be working towards so kind
of a longwind to answer your question
Nolan but that's sort of a lot of the
reason why we started doing this that
that makes a a ton of sense Matt and we
know with the the chap people officer
role chro we know what that role
specifically unlike maybe Finance or
sales that entrepreneurs have have a
harder time understanding what that role
is Right many Founders I've worked with
they're like well that's why you're here
tell me what the priorities are and so
that framework kind of helps think that
through before you start talking to
folks which I think is very smart well I
think you know it almost feels a lot
like tree rings in some ways you know
the product and stuff is what they
always know the best and then sort of
that next ring out is a lot of go to
market they have some knowledge of that
but you know it's more limited but when
you get out to that last string which is
the operation stuff which might be
Finance legal the HR
function manufacturing and supply chain
when you're talking about companies that
a physical product I mean that's the
area where often they're most limited
and you know we often try to do is like
say hey let's let's put a first draft of
the mock together and that's where the
subject matter piece comes into to play
because we've got this network of
Executives and let's say it's a CFO
search you know I'll spend time you know
telling an entrepreneur okay there are
three or four or five stage and Market
appropriate CFOs I'd love to have you
talk to for the CFO search so you can
take that draft mock that we started and
let's stress test your thinking on you
know what you have in there with people
who are real life in the job and then
let's also then have you go and
calibrate you know against that
especially on the personality part of it
because for the most part they probably
haven't spent a lot of time with CFOs
over the course of their career so those
subject matter expertise conversations
are really helpful to flesh the mock out
further but also to start to give the
entrepreneurs a sense of what does the
personality profile for this pool of
talent look like and start to get them
to think more about who am I going to
click with best from a chemistry and fit
perspective because there's always going
to be a lot of people out there who
could do the job let's go ahead and
figure out who's going to be able to do
the job with you it's so funny because
he you've sent a bunch of those
entrepreneurs to me over the years which
I've loved those conversations um
and we we worked together when I back
started GitHub in 2014 and you just you
learned so much over the years and one
of my biggest advice you know to those
folks is like look presumably we all
have the technical and functional skill
set for this job like that's not really
what your your interviewing for right or
unpacking it's the personality of that
person the disposition the fit what they
value you know and I kind of use like
we're all crayons at a cray box but
we're all different colors right and you
have to pick the right the the right one
for you which is usually the kicker the
most important thing I totally agree
with that Kelly and and how do you
actually assess for fit Matt because I
love the the mock process of like what
outcomes do we want what competencies to
this but fit you know I don't think
entrepreneurs really spend a lot of time
thinking about it's more of a feeling
that they have yeah and when you're in
the executive recruiting process like
feeling is not scientific
it's not strategic it's like I have a
good VI and it turns out most execs are
great talkers so how do you assess for
fit and let me tack on how do you help
ch's assess for fit Matt because I'll be
honest I didn't do that as well as I
should have 10 years ago right you learn
but how do you coach the other side to
also assess that side which I didn't do
very well all the time I mean look I
think the answers here are kind of one
and the same to be honest um I think it
starts a lot with stepping out of a
typical interview process because I
think look we've all been doing this
long enough we all can tell when
someone's on their best behavior and you
know people always you know if it's a
regular interview shoes are polished
spit shined and you know everyone's
really just on their aame you have to
test people by putting them in real
world working situations and you know
you can do that in a number of ways and
we talked to our entrepreneurs about
like go through a whiteboard session
with an executive in an interview let's
actually take like a real world business
situation grappling with as a founder
and let's brainstorm it together and
people just naturally without even
realizing it start letting their guard
down and start behaving like they truly
are when you get into that actual like
pretend work session uh we also always
Advocate towards the end of a process
get the whole executive team together
and you know you may give a candidate a
topic and if you give them a topic
that's related to your business you know
you got to give them the data room to
back it up uh so they can actually put a
real presentation together on how they
would have addressed the specific
specific issue from a business
standpoint that you're talking about or
maybe they come in you know there's no
data room they come in and do kind of
 
hey here's everything I've learned
during my interview process here's how
I'm going to approach building out the
finance function or the legal function
or the sales function whatever it is and
you have this working session as a team
which basically allows you as the
entrepreneur not only to be assessing
the fit between you and the candidate
but you can see how that candidate fits
into the room you can see how that
candidate fits into the executive team
and then you follow that up maybe that
goes for like 90 minutes and then you
know you all go out to dinner as a team
and you just continue to see how that
social Dynamic develops I'd say the
other thing too uh which often you know
doesn't get as much emphasis in the
referencing process is really this
question of fit you a lot of times
during referencing we want to know what
did the candidate do we need to confirm
or dispute things they've said they've
done assertions they've made about their
success at a company but sometimes you
know there's not enough time spent on
what did what was it like to work with
that individual and I think that's the
second part of it it's your own Real
World experience during an interview
process with the the working session but
then it's also let me go test out you
know how well they worked with everybody
else you know in Prior roles yep and
then I also think with references I find
you know Founders are typically showing
up with like their typical like five to
seven reference questions I find
actually like running through a process
getting some data on people and then
actually using that data to inform the
reference question specifically in the
areas in which we currently have Flags
gives me better signal what what are the
tips that you have for reference
processing both on the front door and
the back Channel
references yeah you know I think you
brought up a really good point there
referencing should be it's it should be
almost like a continual Loop you know
you're interviewing then you're
referencing you're interviewing then
you're referencing I mean referencing
should be happening through out of
process and I think by the time you know
you're done with an interview process
you probably should end up with you know
maybe it's 50 to 75% of the references
are probably kind of front sheet stuff
and then another 25 to 50 are the back
Channel and a lot of the back channel is
going to be happening kind of in those
early stages where you're interviewing
someone collecting some data and you're
like hey I need to go confirm this let
me go figure out you know out in the
market who I may know that can help me
with this and I think you know we are
honestly we're in a period where you
know people are getting sloppy with back
channels um you know I'm sure we've all
seen it based on the phone calls that
that we get or emails that get we get
from people we don't even know asking
about somebody you know and
it's text whatever you know LinkedIn
messages all that it's just the the
biggest some of the biggest things I
tell our entrepreneurs is like cold
don't cold call into current employers
um you know only reach out to people
that you know well that are going to you
know probably give you good information
don't be out there carpet bomb ing
someone's Network to try to get 15 or 20
or 30 references it's just you know it's
just poor form and you know it puts the
candidate in an awkward position makes
you look unprofessional and potentially
poisons the whole recruiting process
honestly um and even before you get to
outreach I talk a lot to our
entrepreneurs about being precise like
what is your referencing strategy first
of all first and foremost like and to
your point earlier noan like what are we
trying to learn and what we're trying to
learn will evolve during uh a recruiting
process but let's figure out what we
need to learn at each point and then who
are the best people to contact to find
out that information and be targeted and
selective as a result of that and only
be reaching out to people that that you
do know I think the other thing that's
important too is if you're going to be
doing the back Channel stuff there's a
strategy where you can simply just tell
a candidate hey I may get referred to
other people that you know I may want to
call as a reference and is it okay if I
do that without you knowing and just
sort of like in the course of just
talking to them as a candidate say that
to them and that way you know nothing's
a surprise nothing's a problem you know
later on and they can identify if there
are issues that you would not otherwise
know of before you go and reach out to
somebody it's just such a human thing to
do that people just skip the step on and
they want to just kind of like have all
these like back alley conversations
which I I've never really understood as
opposed to just like hey this is a part
of our process we do back channels I
just want to let you know and give you
the opportunity let me know if there's
any flags that you want to tell me about
right now well and you you may find this
funny but like in the end it's about
building a relationship with somebody
you know you're going to work with them
and the funny part of it is like if this
were someone let's say you were going to
try to go date romantically you wouldn't
be calling all of their friends who
you've never met to ask about them so
like you know there there's there's
there's a certain way to do this which
is constructive that actually adds to
the process rather than causes friction
and problems yeah and and using back
channels wisely right to the dating like
if if you back Channel with with someone
that that broke up with them like you
know have the wherewithal and another
they probably not going to say all great
wonderful things and have the maturity
to filter and understand that back
channels are back channels and you have
to kind of vet that out because a lot of
people were text one person could be
biased boom you know and and it's just
not complete hey everyone we'll be right

I want your take on this Matt because
like
people do well in some
situations and not well in others I
worked with Tony at doordash and he used
to say the Michael Jordan of executive
recruiting gets it right two out of
three times he's had incredible
stability amongst his leadership team
but that's not always the case and some
sometimes it's it's situational uh
context sometimes it's business context
sometimes it's my manager context and it
doesn't work how do you guys think about
negative references and like when it
comes up you know as it relates to the
specific new role how do you advise
Founders on that so look I mean I I
think eventually if you call enough
people you will get a negative reference
on somebody that that's that's largely
unavoidable and that's what where I said
earlier like you're not don't call 152
 
reference um I think you kind of have to
evaluate as you were saying is it a
state of the situation or is a trait of
the individual and you know that's
really I think what it comes down to in
the end
because if if you're looking at someone
and was a you know bad fit or they
didn't perform well or maybe they
perform great but the company didn't
execute like they were great CFO but
product and sales could never get their
app together I mean you go through a
long list of reasons why some somebody
may have done well in a job but it
didn't work out for them um and some of
that's going to be you know functional
delivery some of that might be cultural
fit there's a whole different set of
reasons but you have to evaluate like
hey is this simply a result of the
situation the state they were in at the
time or if we connect two or three of
these together okay well hang on a
second then I'm starting to see things
that may be more of a trait we have to
pay attention to but you know it's it's
rare in life for everything to come up
roses on referencing or everything to be
a you know a crown of thorns it's always
going to be Middle Ground stuff and
that's one thing we spend time with our
entrepreneurs to help them go okay
you're you're never going to hire
someone who is you know 100 percentile
on everything they are going to have
weaknesses and let's look at those
weaknesses and like I said figure out
were they a result of the situation they
were in or is it a trait that they have
if the weakness is a result of the
situation let's parse out whether that's
relevant to your company right now are
they going to experience those same
things that cause them potentially to
have failures if it's a trait okay let's
look at the rest of your team is this a
trait that you could afford to take on
that you could potentially have as a
Development Area for this individual or
is that trait that they're weaken so
Mission critical to the role that it
just isn't possible for them to you know
successfully execute in your company so
it's a lot of nuance and and no that's I
think what you were getting at it's just
a ton of nuance in the end and really
are these things black and white I I
also think the the best candidates at
least I've talked to and including
myself is to have the EQ to actually
talk through that before you hear it
from a reference right I think that
that's that's a big sign as well as as
that self-awareness that reflection to
talk through that during the interview
process exactly and I think also when
you're talking about talking through I
think it's really you know it's a great
point you know Founders sometimes feel
like oh God you know can I actually
bring up something to a candidate that I
learned to referencing absolutely I mean
have a conversation with them to get the
added context on exactly you know what
may have happened in that situation
because you may it may give you an
additional set of data that helps you
make a more informed decision about what
to do with that referencing information
I always I totally agree I
also really believe that people grow and
people
change and the more experiences that you
have the more weathered you get the
better off that you will ultimately be I
mean I mean I look back and I'm candidly
embarrassed about the person that I was
 
kind of my
general how I know I'm doing okay is
like every every 10 years I look back
and if I was embarrassed that means I'm
growing really fast I think like that's
when people talk about the negative
aspects of their career that's how you
can begin to assess if they actually
have been growing versus if they're
putting some veneer on it you
could pretty pretty easy sus that out
for sure absolutely how do you guys
think about that how do you how do you
guys think about that though on the
andreon side like when you're like you
know because you're gonna have dat you
guys have I'm assuming so much data on
people and then like you know but as
they move through their career if they
grow and change how do you guys think
about that yeah and that's why I think
it's really important to re-engage with
Executives like it's it's something I
was talking about earlier in the
discussion it's like hey I spent a lot
of time in my early years here building
a network of executive relationships and
a lot of what I'm doing now is
sustaining those relationships and
continuing to find ways to you know add
value for those Executives but in the
course of those conversations you know
you're getting an update on them and
you're getting an update on their lives
what they've accomplished you know and
where they've gone and I think that's
really an important part of this you
know these are not snapshots in time um
everyone is on a Continuum of of
personal and professional growth and
that's why I always think it's dangerous
to you know we talk about this with our
entrepreneurs is like hey I know you
know three people that worked with them
 
going to be relevant data um you know
you may see some things in their past
that come up at that point that maybe
continue in the future or things that
they they grew out of and you know it's
really for me like what what are the
last five to seven years been like in
somebody's career and let's really hone
in on that when we're really trying to
figure out who they are and and you know
what they're going to be able to do for
you right now because anything that's
earlier than that in often cases is is
just it's too dated it's really just old
information Matt in your in your role
the talent partner role it's a it's a
slippery slope sometimes in supporting
these entrepreneurs you know and also
helping them see maybe what they can't
see for themselves would love any any
spicy stories anything you recall and
when you'd have to put your foot down
and and tell a Founder they're wrong or
they're making the wrong choice and and
how do you choose those precious moments
to to do that or not yeah those are
chips that you cannot push to the under
the table that often um so I think it
sort of starts with how we operate I
mean we literally like we're not over
the top with our Founders our Founders
run their companies okay so you know it
truly is an advisory role so you know
whatever you're trying to do is it's a
lot of I guess leading by influence
versus directive and you know that is a
very different um you know action when
you're talking to an entrepreneur and
you're not like no I'm not going to do
that well it's like okay I can't
overrule what you want to do so when
you're doing the influence thing you
know you have to start I think with a
with a foundation where the founder has
to valued your contribution up until
this point and the founder wants you
involved the founder has appreciated the
advice that you've provided to their
business and that founder trusts you so
it starts with that basis of trust to
say okay I trust you and I look to you
as a consiliary or ad on things if that
hasn't been established there's no way
you're going to be able to have any
impact on the decision full stop but I
think once you have that trust
established you can then say hey here's
why I think this is a mistake and when
you tell them I think it's a mistake it
has to be grounded and backed up with
data you know we're dealing with
technical Founders who are very data
oriented individuals it can't be just
this subjective well I think or I feel
that this way like they're going to ask
you well what's the data behind it why
do you think that way and you have to
have that information and look um the
objective data points can come in all
different flavors you know maybe it's
referencing data maybe it is information
you have because you've met the
executive and have a deeper sense of who
they are based on your own referencing
independent and your own evaluation
independent of whatever may have
happened during the process um you may
have company performance data let's say
it's a Sal executive and sales executive
saying hey we hit this quota etc etc
well guess what I actually know
objectively whether that happened or not
you know we can't ask for W2 data
anymore like we used to in the past but
you know it there's still the ability to
validate these things so I think that's
what it comes down to really in the end
is the trust has to be established and
once they trust and value your role in
the process you then have to be able to
provide them the objective data versus
subjective feelings or thoughts it
reminds me of our episode with Steve
Nolan kigan where he said our products
are judgment and credibility um you know
those two things have to be there before
utilizing those chips Matt for sure but
at the same time many Founders are in
the role because they're headstrong they
have a belief they trust their instincts
and they follow it and so what I'm
hearing you say Matt is you know I I you
have to very seldomly pull that card
just in general and then back it up with
data but then at the end of the day it
still is the Founder's decision and I'm
sure there's been times when you've
actually been convicted that hey this
person is making a mistake maybe it
actually they but they went forward
anyways maybe it actually was a mistake
or maybe it wasn't and people are
tactile Learners like they do have to
learn by making their own mistakes too
right absolutely and I think it also
comes down to as well like we naturally
try to work with entrepreneurs back to
that whole conversation we had at the
beginning about how we view talent and
one of the things I mentioned at the
time was EQ and you know you have to
have a group of individuals who you're
advising that want your input they are
willing to show vulnerability and ask
for help they have the right blend of
humility versus confidence all those
things so that they're actually open to
getting the feedback in the first place
and open to hearing differing and
conflicting opinions perhaps on a
decision that we're making because look
this goes beyond Talent they're they're
making business decisions every day and
they have to be of the mindset that I'm
going to take in as much data as I you
know as I should and can so that I have
the most diverse set of information to
work with to make a decision for my
company whether it's whether we you know
invest in product a over product B
whether I hire this CFO candidate or
another one they have to have a mindset
that is already predisposed to wanting
the help and wanting the input from
multiple constituencies otherwise
they're it's probably not going to work
for them as an entrepreneur honestly
because they're going to stub their toe
a lot of times and eventually that
repeated repetitive toe stopping is
going to have a serious you know impact
on the business and Matt I'm assuming
that's part of the your vetting process
and investing in entrepreneurs is that
EQ side well I mean look because we have
a different model and I mean look we're
we have a whole operating team over here
that spends a lot of time helping
entrepreneurs as both of you know you
know learn the nuts and bolts of how do
you hire talent build teams Market the
company sell product raise money you
know all stuff that is on rurs they
haven't done before for the most part
but it's all stuff they need to learn
how to do well to be successful we want
to work with entrepreneurs they're going
to tap into that um so you know
naturally we're going to be predisposed
to working with folks that are going to
want to leverage all of those resources
that are available to them to help them
become a better CEO yep Matt you
mentioned you have a lot of latitude in
your role which is great um is there
it's also a lot of pressure right in
what you do I know what you do and is
there any any moments where like that
Latitude becomes a little less and
you're feeling the pressure and what is
that like in in your role when those
moments hit yeah I mean I think for for
me I mean look having worked in startups
before this is it's a it's a different
feeling of of pressure than it is when
you're in an operating role and
literally you're looking at you know the
bank account balance going hey can we
make payroll at the end of the month you
know it's it's it's a different feeling
um I think that the biggest thing from a
pressure standpoint over here is just
when you're in an advisory role again
you're you're operating by influence you
don't really have control over the
situation but yet your your your own
success I think both personally how I
measure myself and also you know to a
degree how we measure you know ourselves
here at the firm too is based on the
success of these things so you're
basically measuring success against
things that you don't have control over
and I think that's the essence of the
difficulty of the advisor role when you
feel pressure at times you're like hey I
think this is how this should go this is
what I would do if I were in your
situation but at the same time I can't
go make you do that um and look we take
a lot of ownership in what we do working
with the portfolio because we're really
involved with you know all of you very
closely on a day-to-day basis and part
of the reason we're able to do that is
we have such a large team we're able to
be proactive we're not just running
around reactively putting out fires like
I'm when I work on a project with the
portfolio I'm probably investing at
least four sometimes up more months
upwards sometimes of a year on the whole
process so there's a tremendous sense of
ownership that comes with that and a
tremendous sense of responsibility and
pressure it feels to make sure that's
done right even though I'm only in an
advisory capacity so that that's a big
part of it for me honestly in terms of
probably more self-induced pressure in
some ways Matt I want to talk a bit
about veteran hiring um so two of my
favorite people I've ever worked with uh
shout out to Jeff and then also to Casey
North at D Dash uh
ex-military and you know you do a lot of
work with transitioning veterans into
startups talk to me a little bit about
like why is this such a good fit from a
skill set standpoint like why is going
for the military into startups like why
does that work so often yeah so I think
it works if if you think about the
military environment especially folks
who've been in the Special Operations
Community um they're used to dealing
with very Dynamic chaotic very resource
constrained environments where you know
that is very analogous to what happens
in the startup World obviously the
subject domain and the work environment
are of course very different but in the
end what a lot of these folks are very
good at especially from the Iraq
Afghanistan generation is I'm going to
take a disparate group of people some of
them might be from my own unit some of
them might be from the broader um you
know Department of Defense establishment
civilian and Military side some from the
US government some probably from some
non-government entities wherever it is
that I am currently deployed maybe from
the government there as well some local
tribes whomever probably some or most of
whom don't even like each other and I'm
going to get that group of people
together to accomplish a common Mission
and a common purpose now how many times
can you think of when you've been in a
startup where you've had a similar
situation where you got to get a bunch
of people in a room you got to maybe
bang some heads to get them to work
together well but we have a problem we
need to solve that's cross functional in
nature maybe our order to cast cycle
isn't working or you know are are our
products not working at all you know in
whatever environment it's been deployed
in whatever these people are used to
dealing with that type of situation
again the subject matter is completely
different the the process to get to the
answer though is very very similar and
when you combine that skill set with the
leadership they bring to the table I
think that's why they're as successful
as they usually are
I love that the uh the the two guys I
was referring to are in operations roles
and and have ascended insanely fast I
see this this issue though with Founders
especially in today's job market who are
indexing on people that have done the
job before how do you how do you think
about the experience versus trajectory
conversation yeah it's it's a great
question because you're essentially
betting in I think the difference is
you're having to buy into a different
kind of
potential so you know the potential
you're buying into is their ability to
learn your product and learn your
business which is different than the
potential you usually buy into where
like someone is very good technically or
they're very good go to market they're
very good at finance and you're near
you're merely betting on them to
progress and Ascend in both the scope
and level of their responsibilities as a
leader so it's almost the exact inverse
where you're already bringing someone in
who's very good on the leadership in the
soft skill side but now you need to bet
on their ability to ramp on your
business so that's kind of how I usually
frame it with
entrepreneurs um and I think the other
challenge often times
is especially for folks who've been
enlisted not officers you have folks who
you know may have spent their entire
careers professionally since high school
you're talking you know 20 25 years and
they don't have a college degree or if
they do have a college degree it was
something that would you know attained
remotely while they were you know on
active duty these people are incredibly
skilled incredibly gifted individuals
but it's very difficult for recruiters
to be able to map you know their skill
set to what the open jobs may be in a
company and you know the translation
guide doesn't exist anymore like it used
to because look we have the smallest
active duty military you know in our
lifetimes easily you know once we got
out once we you know left the draft
behind and we went to all volunteer
Armed Forces you know most of society
doesn't have regular contact with people
who are in the military anymore so they
don't understand as easily what those
folks can do as may have existed 30 40
 
proportion of the population was
Veterans and it was hard like you
probably everybody in their family had
somebody who serve so that translation
guide is gone so it's a lot harder for
folks to understand how the skill set
translates and what I often talk to vets
about is like honestly don't go through
normal recruiting processes because you
know you're going to have people looking
at your paper that just don't understand
what you've done you know when when you
see a company that has a role that
you're interested in make sure you
already have built out the network that
allows you to go talk to somebody
outside of the recruiting process who
can help you who understands who you are
maybe it's a former you know maybe it's
someone who's a vet um who already works
at the company you know you've already
established relationships we talked to
vets a lot about build your Network
first and then the job will follow from
that because when you see something that
looks of interest at a
company you can reach out to your
contacts there and they can be advocates
for you because you're going to be an
outof thebox hire you're not going to be
someone who checks everything that goes
down the list for sure so you've got to
have people who are outside the process
who are advocating for your candidacy
Matt how do you all structure that is it
more informal is it a a more formal kind
of widespread program for you all how is
that set up yeah so you know we've
worked with a number of organizations
over the years um you know I've been on
the board of commit Foundation now for
probably about seven or eight years we
do a workshop with them every year uh we
worked pretty closely in the past with
Bethany coats and what she was doing at
breakline we have good relationships
with honor Foundation uh we're investors
in shift.org so it kind of becomes a bit
of a a hybrid like you know we do these
workshops um where you know you have
folks that are interested in technology
and VC uh who are coming in and then
we're ALS so you know I take a lot of
one-on-one intros as well where you know
veterans who I know that I've worked
with who have transitioned like hey you
know there's this individual over here
that you really should meet I think
would be you know a fantastic you know
high potential person in the industry
that type of thing so it's a mix of both
honestly I love that there yeah those
informal connections are super powerful
so I love that Matt just transitioning
to a little bit about the moment that
we're in today um I still I I am of the
belief that at least the beginning of
 
the Venture back tech space how are you
advising Founders on their talent
strategy right now and how are you
thinking about 2024 yeah I mean look we
still got a lot of uncertainty out there
um and you know I think part of the
advice depends on the stage of the
company to be perfectly honest you know
when we're talking about the earlier
stage companies a lot of what they're
working on is still those very focused
like our first engineering leader our
first product leader our first go to
market leader and I think you know if
you have your funding secured where for
the next couple years you're going to be
working on what you're working on
regardless of what those macro
conditions look like I think you sort of
moving ahead with building that core
leadership team um is really important I
think the challenge starts to come in on
the growth and later stage side because
you've got a lot of companies that you
know in some cases already expected to
be public entities by now with the
infusion of capital from that um and
others that are St backed up now waiting
for that you know wave of companies to
go out so I think there it's it's you
know when you're looking at your hiring
plan it's really about you know we need
to be focused on profitable growth um it
is not growth for the sake of growth
anymore you know companies have to run
much more lean and tighter than they
have over the last 15 years and it's a
little bit of a Back to the Future
feeling because we've kind of returned I
think to a macro environment that
reflects where we were you know in the
 
the advice that we we provide is
somewhat dependent really on the stage
of the company and and where they are
from a liquidity standpoint Matt we
talked about this I think a couple
months ago and we chatted on the phone
right about the the market shifting
especially with those later Sage
companies that were close to IPO kind of
valuations changing coupled with the
this the struggle of hiring topnotch
Executives in this time especially with
that that Equity change have you seen
any creative ways of reconciling that or
thinking about that or anything
companies are doing to still get great
talent even though this Market has
shifted yeah I mean I think you do at
some point just have to recognize
reality and I think you and I may have
talked about this a little bit at the
time and you know a lot of the the reset
that has taken place has had to do with
employee retention issues um you know a
lot less to do without going out raising
New Capital so I think this this idea of
trying to retain your top employees and
one of the name ways you have to do that
is to kind of reset what their their the
valuations look like um and potentially
then you know provide additional um
Equity to help true them up I think is a
really you know important thing to be
considering right now um to be able to
retain that top talent if you do that
then there's a whole bunch of cascading
effects that of course then make you
more marketable to potential new
employees but I think the core of it
starts with kind of just honestly
ripping the bandaid off and going hey
you know we we if the longer the longer
it takes for us to do this the less
competitive we probably become um and we
have to just recognize that and just
bite the bullet I talked to a Founder
few weeks ago who had raised a really
large round at a really high valuation
that no longer makes sense in today's
world and that person's they're now
recruiting for sea level roles and well
I ask him first I was like how are you
talking to candidates about this and he
was like well how do you think I should
because I have no idea
and my guidance to him was just be
honest right we raised in 2021 this was
the market price I know it's no longer
the market price but we don't need to go
to market today for a new financing
round but my commitment is is when we do
we will Mark you to Market at that new
financing price and then reup your
Equity do you think that that's good
advice and are you talking Founders
similarly I mean it's very situational I
mean there are certain companies that
let's say you have a very long Runway of
capital let's say you've got three four
five six years even some of the
companies I've talked to have had like
six or seven years of Runway I think
it's very dependent on that question
damn yeah yeah so it's you know how long
do you have before you have to go
reprice via an equity raise and if
you've got a long time that's let say
call it over 36 months you know I think
that argument can work now of course the
candidate has to buy into everything
else the candidate has got to buy into a
whole bunch of aspects of things so I I
think you've got to go ahead and have
the executive buying into everything
else buying into the vision of vision of
the company feeling a lot of passion for
what that vision is buying into who you
are as a leader and your ability to
execute on the vision everything else
has to be Rock Solid because you know
there's going to be a lot of other
opportunities that are going to be out
there during that time frame after which
you hire this person that are going to
be more financially attractive in
probably most cases and the last thing
you want to see is a candidate who you
hire who's constantly looking over their
shoulder going hey oh that looks
interesting oh that over there looks a
lot you know so that's you don't want to
go you know win the battle that way but
then eventually lose the war because you
brought this person in but they weren't
totally on board with everything and
therefore they're always going to be
looking for the next best thing really
well said yep for sure so Matt I know we
have a few minutes left just transition
to our rapid fire called Talent rules
couple quick questions for you who who
has been your best H in your career and
why so I think you all appreciate this
there was a woman I hired in the third
startup I worked for um there's always
that you know when you're still like
under 50 people or even 100 people
there's always someone who's that
operational glue and it was a woman
named Michelle um and I hired her first
hire when I joined the company and she
basically did all the QuickBooks work
was the office manager handled all the
HR paperwork was the company
Confessional As to everything that went
on and we had a lot of drama and I just
feel like you know those PE like that
one person basic did like five or six
jobs and I always find those people are
incredibly short supply in startups
there's not a lot of them out there but
when you find one they are a true Gem
and they can do so much to help the
company so probably not the answer you
were expecting
but I can I can feel what you're
explaining though I love it can um and
what has been one of your most favorite
interview questions over the years that
has given you the biggest best signal on
candidates um really good signal I get
is I ask people what's the toughest
piece of feedback they've received in
the last five years and how did they
respond um that's always one that I find
gets at a lot of issues related to EQ
critical thinking organizational Savvy a
lot of cases too growth mindset yeah
that's that's also my favorite question
Matt I feel like when you ask somebody
about a tough piece of feedback not only
do you get like all the soft spots you
also get like what tactically did
somebody give them feedback on like what
did someone else think that their
biggest area of growth is uh and then
were they able to learn from that and
make it a strength and then when someone
also basically answers with that you
know classic looks like a backhanded
compliment to themselves by the time
they're done you're like okay you you
you you are no no good to me that just
makes me throw up like I throw up in
thinking about that
 
yeah I know yeah we we've heard that on
like multiple episodes so like when is
that just gonna die because everyone
knows everyone knows now and so to
Nolan's
point just be
authentic yeah there are slow Learners
out
 
there but RI should be it should be
incredible self-awareness authenticity
that and and to get that that feedback
on both sides yeah but it's still out
there yeah it is yeah Matt this has been
so good thank you so much for the time
our audience is going to take away so
much about exec recruiting from this
episode we can't thank you enough 100%
thanks Matt my pleasure appreciate you
both inviting me on and uh do it again
