a little bit about Ventures lens on
 
a little bit about Ventures lens on
talent and how does how does like a
 
talent and how does how does like a
venture Talent partner assess Talent
 
venture Talent partner assess Talent
yeah so I think you know it also it sort
 
yeah so I think you know it also it sort
of all starts with what your mission and
 
of all starts with what your mission and
kind of what your role is and I think
 
kind of what your role is and I think
you know the way that we're structured
 
you know the way that we're structured
over here is is somewhat different and
 
over here is is somewhat different and
unique relative to a lot of the other
 
unique relative to a lot of the other
you know Venture Talent partners that
 
you know Venture Talent partners that
are out there and I talk to a lot when I
 
are out there and I talk to a lot when I
meet Executives for the first time I
 
meet Executives for the first time I
often talk to them about this I'm like
 
often talk to them about this I'm like
hey think of me almost as you want a
 
hey think of me almost as you want a
talent agent rather than a recruiter uh
 
talent agent rather than a recruiter uh
so I think you know our lens at least on
 
so I think you know our lens at least on
Talent sort of starts with that
 
Talent sort of starts with that
differentiator you know so when we're
 
differentiator you know so when we're
meeting um Executives or we're helping
 
meeting um Executives or we're helping
companies we're coming at it from the
 
companies we're coming at it from the
lens of honestly not being recruiters
 
lens of honestly not being recruiters
we're coming at it from the lens of
 
we're coming at it from the lens of
being advisers we're coming at it from
 
being advisers we're coming at it from
the lens of being counselors so I think
 
the lens of being counselors so I think
that makes a huge difference in terms of
 
that makes a huge difference in terms of
what our lens looks like I think you
 
what our lens looks like I think you
know when we're meeting Executives the
 
know when we're meeting Executives the
differen is we're focusing a lot more on
 
differen is we're focusing a lot more on
their
 
their
intangibles um and their soft skills in
 
intangibles um and their soft skills in
addition to their functional
 
addition to their functional
capabilities because we're not really
 
capabilities because we're not really
meeting Executives and evaluating them
 
meeting Executives and evaluating them
for a specific role we're meeting them
 
for a specific role we're meeting them
to kind of bring them into our Network
 
to kind of bring them into our Network
and be there as a resource to help them
 
and be there as a resource to help them
um you know further their careers we're
 
um you know further their careers we're
not necessarily interviewing them for a
 
not necessarily interviewing them for a
specific role in the portfolio so when
 
specific role in the portfolio so when
we're talking to Executives and
 
we're talking to Executives and
evaluating them it's a lot about EQ like
 
evaluating them it's a lot about EQ like
for example how do you take feed Feb
 
for example how do you take feed Feb
back you know what are the things that
 
back you know what are the things that
you're aware of that might be your
 
you're aware of that might be your
personal triggers you know what do you
 
personal triggers you know what do you
see as your interpersonal impact in a
 
see as your interpersonal impact in a
room you know what sort of balance they
 
room you know what sort of balance they
have between humility and you know
 
have between humility and you know
self-confidence a lot of those things
 
self-confidence a lot of those things
we're also looking at motivations
 
we're also looking at motivations
intrinsic motivations extrinsic
 
intrinsic motivations extrinsic
motivations we're doing a lot on
 
motivations we're doing a lot on
critical thinking like looking at their
 
critical thinking like looking at their
analytical skills their business Acumen
 
analytical skills their business Acumen
skills we spend time looking at their or
 
skills we spend time looking at their or
Savvy their leadership skills all these
 
Savvy their leadership skills all these
things that aren't necessarily role
 
things that aren't necessarily role
specific but going to be a lot more
 
specific but going to be a lot more
relative to who they are as an executive
 
relative to who they are as an executive
and I think then that also plays in you
 
and I think then that also plays in you
know look I've worked with both of you
 
know look I've worked with both of you
when you were in the portfolio and you
 
when you were in the portfolio and you
know the conversations that we had were
 
know the conversations that we had were
always a bit more kind of strategic
 
always a bit more kind of strategic
around how to approach the role how can
 
around how to approach the role how can
we help the team get calibrated on the
 
we help the team get calibrated on the
role who are the best search Partners to
 
role who are the best search Partners to
use and let then sort of letting you and
 
use and let then sort of letting you and
that search firm run with the execution
 
that search firm run with the execution
and we remained in that advisory
 
and we remained in that advisory
capacity kind of being there to help you
 
capacity kind of being there to help you
with you know with referencing
 
with you know with referencing
compensation guidance our views of
 
compensation guidance our views of
people that are in process that we know
 
people that are in process that we know
that type of thing so I think you know
 
that type of thing so I think you know
our lens on Talent is going to be a
 
our lens on Talent is going to be a
little bit different because the role as
 
little bit different because the role as
the the talent partner is defined here
 
the the talent partner is defined here
very differently Matt what percentage of
 
very differently Matt what percentage of
time are you spending on external kind
 
time are you spending on external kind
of succession planning meeting new
 
of succession planning meeting new
Executives versus advising
 
Executives versus advising
portfolios inside people inside the
 
portfolios inside people inside the
portfolio and how do you balance that
 
portfolio and how do you balance that
it's a great question I think probably
 
it's a great question I think probably
on average um over sort of the lens at
 
on average um over sort of the lens at
least it's probably about 40% with the
 
least it's probably about 40% with the
portfolio about 40% with the executive
 
portfolio about 40% with the executive
community and then about 20% on the work
 
community and then about 20% on the work
with the veterans community which you
 
with the veterans community which you
know we can get into later but so if you
 
know we can get into later but so if you
sort of look at portfolio versus
 
sort of look at portfolio versus
external in total it's probably about 40
 
external in total it's probably about 40
 
you know in a given week it might be
 
you know in a given week it might be
 
following week it just so I think a lot
 
following week it just so I think a lot
of it for us at least is you know we
 
of it for us at least is you know we
measure a lot I'll put it to you that
 
measure a lot I'll put it to you that
way in terms of um
 
way in terms of um
you know tracking how we're spending our
 
you know tracking how we're spending our
time and it's not it's not like we're
 
time and it's not it's not like we're
lawyers billing Out hours that's not it
 
lawyers billing Out hours that's not it
it's more where are we putting our
 
it's more where are we putting our
energy are we putting our energy into
 
energy are we putting our energy into
you know meeting new executives are we
 
you know meeting new executives are we
putting our energy into sustaining those
 
putting our energy into sustaining those
relationships by being there to offer
 
relationships by being there to offer
counsel or introductions are we putting
 
counsel or introductions are we putting
our energy into you know being on search
 
our energy into you know being on search
for update calls so we have a lot of
 
for update calls so we have a lot of
different metrics that we you know track
 
different metrics that we you know track
internally so that we can kind of make
 
internally so that we can kind of make
sure what we're keeping a good balance
 
sure what we're keeping a good balance
and that there are certain parts of the
 
and that there are certain parts of the
work that we do that aren't forgotten or
 
work that we do that aren't forgotten or
left behind you know In the Heat of the
 
left behind you know In the Heat of the
Moment that's really interesting how is
 
Moment that's really interesting how is
your success measured yeah so you know
 
your success measured yeah so you know
to get into some of the details on that
 
to get into some of the details on that
so you know we have all of us sort of we
 
so you know we have all of us sort of we
we have you know metrics that kind of
 
we have you know metrics that kind of
roll up as a team but you know within
 
roll up as a team but you know within
that set of metrics we have you know a
 
that set of metrics we have you know a
fair amount of flexibility and latitude
 
fair amount of flexibility and latitude
is kind of where we choose to spend our
 
is kind of where we choose to spend our
time so for example you know when I
 
time so for example you know when I
first started here back in you know 2012
 
first started here back in you know 2012
there was a ton of energy being put
 
there was a ton of energy being put
towards building a network of executive
 
towards building a network of executive
relationships that um is now somewhat
 
relationships that um is now somewhat
more about sustaining those
 
more about sustaining those
relationships so the activity and
 
relationships so the activity and
Cadence around that sustaining is very
 
Cadence around that sustaining is very
different than it is when you're
 
different than it is when you're
building um you know we're also you know
 
building um you know we're also you know
measuring the activity with that Network
 
measuring the activity with that Network
in terms of hey how many new execs have
 
in terms of hey how many new execs have
you interacted with this year uh what
 
you interacted with this year uh what
have you been able to do for the
 
have you been able to do for the
executive community in terms of the
 
executive community in terms of the
number of councils you've provided
 
number of councils you've provided
number of introductions you've provided
 
number of introductions you've provided
hey how many you know search programs
 
hey how many you know search programs
have you worked on with the
 
have you worked on with the
portfolio um you know what's the value
 
portfolio um you know what's the value
you've been able to add there in terms
 
you've been able to add there in terms
of hey you know on the search update
 
of hey you know on the search update
calls helping them with mocks beforehand
 
calls helping them with mocks beforehand
how many subject matter experts
 
how many subject matter experts
beforehand were you able to introduce
 
beforehand were you able to introduce
all these different things that just
 
all these different things that just
help us really figure out what works and
 
help us really figure out what works and
what doesn't work with the portfolio and
 
what doesn't work with the portfolio and
the executive Community but also is a
 
the executive Community but also is a
way to track the amount of energy that
 
way to track the amount of energy that
we're generating um you know in terms of
 
we're generating um you know in terms of
our daily work and making sure that you
 
our daily work and making sure that you
know we're getting done what we need to
 
know we're getting done what we need to
get done yeah you you mentioned Mock and
 
get done yeah you you mentioned Mock and
Jeff stump is is one of the people that
 
Jeff stump is is one of the people that
I worked closely with when I was at
 
I worked closely with when I was at
Andre and the mock is something I was
 
Andre and the mock is something I was
not aware of before I worked with you
 
not aware of before I worked with you
all and it completely blew my mind I
 
all and it completely blew my mind I
think it's the best framework for
 
think it's the best framework for
executive hiring that I've seen can you
 
executive hiring that I've seen can you
just describe to mock to our audience
 
just describe to mock to our audience
what it is and why you guys are so
 
what it is and why you guys are so
passionate about using it well I think
 
passionate about using it well I think
look all of us have you know been doing
 
look all of us have you know been doing
this for a long time and I think what
 
this for a long time and I think what
tends to happen sometimes with you know
 
tends to happen sometimes with you know
position profiles is a couple things one
 
position profiles is a couple things one
is they generally tend to kind of be
 
is they generally tend to kind of be
recitations of all the possible
 
recitations of all the possible
responsibilities that could be
 
responsibilities that could be
encompassed in a role and you know
 
encompassed in a role and you know
there's never really any prioritization
 
there's never really any prioritization
put against well okay fine this you have
 
put against well okay fine this you have
this huge long list what are the things
 
this huge long list what are the things
that you actually really think the
 
that you actually really think the
person should focus on and let's take a
 
person should focus on and let's take a
subset let's take that subset and really
 
subset let's take that subset and really
start to figure out how do we interview
 
start to figure out how do we interview
against those really important items to
 
against those really important items to
make sure that these people have the
 
make sure that these people have the
competencies and experiences to do them
 
competencies and experiences to do them
so so I think that's sort of the first
 
so so I think that's sort of the first
thing that you see with a lot of
 
thing that you see with a lot of
position descriptions I think the second
 
position descriptions I think the second
thing you see a lot of times as well is
 
thing you see a lot of times as well is
it's a rushed process and I think a lot
 
it's a rushed process and I think a lot
of times with entrepreneurs they always
 
of times with entrepreneurs they always
you know whenever you start working on
 
you know whenever you start working on
something you automatically feel like
 
something you automatically feel like
you're three or four months
 
you're three or four months
behind so what we really tried to do
 
behind so what we really tried to do
with the mock it stands for Mission
 
with the mock it stands for Mission
outcome competency what we really tried
 
outcome competency what we really tried
to do with it was number one impress
 
to do with it was number one impress
upon the entrepreneur that let's try to
 
upon the entrepreneur that let's try to
get in front of a need as far as
 
get in front of a need as far as
possible so we have the time to really
 
possible so we have the time to really
sit down with and figure out what's the
 
sit down with and figure out what's the
mission for the role what are the
 
mission for the role what are the
outcomes you want to achieve with the
 
outcomes you want to achieve with the
role and what are the competencies that
 
role and what are the competencies that
um will determine whether a person can
 
um will determine whether a person can
achieve those outcomes and I'll kind of
 
achieve those outcomes and I'll kind of
break this out bit by bit here so the
 
break this out bit by bit here so the
mission really is it's the elevator
 
mission really is it's the elevator
pitch it's the one or two lines that
 
pitch it's the one or two lines that
dictate exactly what you want this
 
dictate exactly what you want this
person to really deliver at a high level
 
person to really deliver at a high level
what is the mission of the role the
 
what is the mission of the role the
outcomes are basically six or eight
 
outcomes are basically six or eight
things that you want them to achieve in
 
things that you want them to achieve in
the course of probably the first 12 or
 
the course of probably the first 12 or
 
competencies are related to what what
 
competencies are related to what what
are the things this person needs to have
 
are the things this person needs to have
accomplished what are the skills that
 
accomplished what are the skills that
they need to have that we have evidence
 
they need to have that we have evidence
therefore they can actually achieve
 
therefore they can actually achieve
those outcomes now the thing that you
 
those outcomes now the thing that you
see that's missing from this is a
 
see that's missing from this is a
recitation of responsibilities in the
 
recitation of responsibilities in the
job and largely kind of a recitation of
 
job and largely kind of a recitation of
the type of experience a person has in
 
the type of experience a person has in
the role and we you know it's a
 
the role and we you know it's a
deliberate distinction because we have
 
deliberate distinction because we have
found that you know unless you really
 
found that you know unless you really
lay out what almost amounts to that
 
lay out what almost amounts to that
person's performance review in Reverse
 
person's performance review in Reverse
which is the outcomes it doesn't really
 
which is the outcomes it doesn't really
matter what you list as the day-to-day
 
matter what you list as the day-to-day
responsibilities because when you do
 
responsibilities because when you do
that massive recitation of day-to-day
 
that massive recitation of day-to-day
responsibilities it doesn't come with
 
responsibilities it doesn't come with
any prioritization and then you know
 
any prioritization and then you know
what happens so often is a person gets
 
what happens so often is a person gets
hired off of that list of
 
hired off of that list of
responsibilities their onboarding is
 
responsibilities their onboarding is
pretty limited because in a startup you
 
pretty limited because in a startup you
know it's hard you know just to get time
 
know it's hard you know just to get time
to talk through these things so a person
 
to talk through these things so a person
might be in the job 30 60 90 days before
 
might be in the job 30 60 90 days before
they have any sense from the CEO or
 
they have any sense from the CEO or
founder they're working for what the
 
founder they're working for what the
actual priorities are that you want me
 
actual priorities are that you want me
to get done out of this long list of
 
to get done out of this long list of
responsibilities if you lay out through
 
responsibilities if you lay out through
the mock process what the outcomes are
 
the mock process what the outcomes are
going to be you interview against those
 
going to be you interview against those
outcomes to drive the competencies even
 
outcomes to drive the competencies even
if there's some limited CS during the
 
if there's some limited CS during the
onboarding process during the person's
 
onboarding process during the person's
first quarter on the job they still know
 
first quarter on the job they still know
from the position description what the
 
from the position description what the
heck the outcomes are that they're
 
heck the outcomes are that they're
supposed to be working towards so kind
 
supposed to be working towards so kind
of a longwind to answer your question
 
of a longwind to answer your question
Nolan but that's sort of a lot of the
 
Nolan but that's sort of a lot of the
reason why we started doing this that
 
reason why we started doing this that
that makes a a ton of sense Matt and we
 
that makes a a ton of sense Matt and we
know with the the chap people officer
 
know with the the chap people officer
role chro we know what that role
 
role chro we know what that role
specifically unlike maybe Finance or
 
specifically unlike maybe Finance or
sales that entrepreneurs have have a
 
sales that entrepreneurs have have a
harder time understanding what that role
 
harder time understanding what that role
is Right many Founders I've worked with
 
is Right many Founders I've worked with

they're like well that's why you're here
tell me what the priorities are and so
 
tell me what the priorities are and so
that framework kind of helps think that
 
that framework kind of helps think that
through before you start talking to
 
through before you start talking to
folks which I think is very smart well I
 
folks which I think is very smart well I
think you know it almost feels a lot
 
think you know it almost feels a lot
like tree rings in some ways you know
 
like tree rings in some ways you know
the product and stuff is what they

most important thing I totally agree
 
most important thing I totally agree
with that Kelly and and how do you
 
with that Kelly and and how do you
actually assess for fit Matt because I
 
actually assess for fit Matt because I
love the the mock process of like what

that's why I always think it's dangerous
to you know we talk about this with our
 
to you know we talk about this with our
entrepreneurs is like hey I know you
 
entrepreneurs is like hey I know you

going to be relevant data um you know
 
going to be relevant data um you know
you may see some things in their past
 
you may see some things in their past
that come up at that point that maybe
 
that come up at that point that maybe
continue in the future or things that
 
continue in the future or things that
they they grew out of and you know it's
 
they they grew out of and you know it's
really for me like what what are the
 
really for me like what what are the
last five to seven years been like in
 
last five to seven years been like in
somebody's career and let's really hone
 
somebody's career and let's really hone
in on that when we're really trying to
 
in on that when we're really trying to
figure out who they are and and you know
 
figure out who they are and and you know
what they're going to be able to do for
 
what they're going to be able to do for
you right now because anything that's
 
you right now because anything that's
earlier than that in often cases is is

information Matt in your in your role
the talent partner role it's a it's a
 
the talent partner role it's a it's a
slippery slope sometimes in supporting
 
slippery slope sometimes in supporting
these entrepreneurs you know and also
 
these entrepreneurs you know and also
helping them see maybe what they can't
 
helping them see maybe what they can't
see for themselves would love any any

spicy stories anything you recall and
 
spicy stories anything you recall and
when you'd have to put your foot down
 
when you'd have to put your foot down
and and tell a Founder they're wrong or
 
and and tell a Founder they're wrong or
they're making the wrong choice and and
 
they're making the wrong choice and and
how do you choose those precious moments
 
how do you choose those precious moments
to to do that or not yeah those are
 
to to do that or not yeah those are
chips that you cannot push to the under
 
chips that you cannot push to the under
the table that often um so I think it
 
the table that often um so I think it
sort of starts with how we operate I
 
sort of starts with how we operate I
mean we literally like we're not over
 
mean we literally like we're not over
the top with our Founders our Founders
 
the top with our Founders our Founders
run their companies okay so you know it
 
run their companies okay so you know it
truly is an advisory role so you know
 
truly is an advisory role so you know
whatever you're trying to do is it's a
 
whatever you're trying to do is it's a
lot of I guess leading by influence
 
lot of I guess leading by influence
versus directive and you know that is a
 
versus directive and you know that is a
very different um you know action when
 
very different um you know action when
you're talking to an entrepreneur and
 
you're talking to an entrepreneur and
you're not like no I'm not going to do
 
you're not like no I'm not going to do
that well it's like okay I can't
 
that well it's like okay I can't
overrule what you want to do so when
 
overrule what you want to do so when
you're doing the influence thing you
 
you're doing the influence thing you
know you have to start I think with a
 
know you have to start I think with a
with a foundation where the founder has
 
with a foundation where the founder has
to valued your contribution up until
 
to valued your contribution up until
this point and the founder wants you
 
this point and the founder wants you
involved the founder has appreciated the
 
involved the founder has appreciated the
advice that you've provided to their
 
advice that you've provided to their
business and that founder trusts you so
 
business and that founder trusts you so
it starts with that basis of trust to
 
it starts with that basis of trust to
say okay I trust you and I look to you
 
say okay I trust you and I look to you
as a consiliary or ad on things if that
 
as a consiliary or ad on things if that
hasn't been established there's no way
 
hasn't been established there's no way
you're going to be able to have any
 
you're going to be able to have any
impact on the decision full stop but I
 
impact on the decision full stop but I
think once you have that trust
 
think once you have that trust
established you can then say hey here's
 
established you can then say hey here's
why I think this is a mistake and when
 
why I think this is a mistake and when
you tell them I think it's a mistake it
 
you tell them I think it's a mistake it
has to be grounded and backed up with
 
has to be grounded and backed up with
data you know we're dealing with
 
data you know we're dealing with
technical Founders who are very data
 
technical Founders who are very data
oriented individuals it can't be just
 
oriented individuals it can't be just
this subjective well I think or I feel
 
this subjective well I think or I feel
that this way like they're going to ask
 
that this way like they're going to ask
you well what's the data behind it why
 
you well what's the data behind it why
do you think that way and you have to
 
do you think that way and you have to
have that information and look um the
 
have that information and look um the
objective data points can come in all
 
objective data points can come in all
different flavors you know maybe it's
 
different flavors you know maybe it's
referencing data maybe it is information
 
referencing data maybe it is information
you have because you've met the
 
you have because you've met the
executive and have a deeper sense of who
 
executive and have a deeper sense of who
they are based on your own referencing
 
they are based on your own referencing
independent and your own evaluation
 
independent and your own evaluation
independent of whatever may have
 
independent of whatever may have
happened during the process um you may
 
happened during the process um you may
have company performance data let's say
 
have company performance data let's say
it's a Sal executive and sales executive
 
it's a Sal executive and sales executive
saying hey we hit this quota etc etc
 
saying hey we hit this quota etc etc
well guess what I actually know
 
well guess what I actually know
objectively whether that happened or not
 
objectively whether that happened or not
you know we can't ask for W2 data
 
you know we can't ask for W2 data
anymore like we used to in the past but
 
anymore like we used to in the past but
you know it there's still the ability to
 
you know it there's still the ability to
validate these things so I think that's
 
validate these things so I think that's
what it comes down to really in the end
 
what it comes down to really in the end
is the trust has to be established and
 
is the trust has to be established and
once they trust and value your role in
 
once they trust and value your role in
the process you then have to be able to
 
the process you then have to be able to
provide them the objective data versus
 
provide them the objective data versus
subjective feelings or thoughts it
 
subjective feelings or thoughts it

those two things have to be there before
 
those two things have to be there before
utilizing those chips Matt for sure but
 
utilizing those chips Matt for sure but
at the same time many Founders are in
 
at the same time many Founders are in
the role because they're headstrong they
 
the role because they're headstrong they
have a belief they trust their instincts
 
have a belief they trust their instincts
and they follow it and so what I'm
 
and they follow it and so what I'm
hearing you say Matt is you know I I you
 
hearing you say Matt is you know I I you
have to very seldomly pull that card
 
have to very seldomly pull that card
just in general and then back it up with
 
just in general and then back it up with
data but then at the end of the day it
 
data but then at the end of the day it
still is the Founder's decision and I'm
 
still is the Founder's decision and I'm
sure there's been times when you've

actually been convicted that hey this

become a better CEO yep Matt you
 
become a better CEO yep Matt you
mentioned you have a lot of latitude in
 
mentioned you have a lot of latitude in
your role which is great um is there
 
your role which is great um is there
it's also a lot of pressure right in
 
it's also a lot of pressure right in
what you do I know what you do and is
 
what you do I know what you do and is
there any any moments where like that
 
there any any moments where like that
Latitude becomes a little less and
 
Latitude becomes a little less and
you're feeling the pressure and what is
 
you're feeling the pressure and what is
that like in in your role when those
 
that like in in your role when those
moments hit yeah I mean I think for for
 
moments hit yeah I mean I think for for
me I mean look having worked in startups
 
me I mean look having worked in startups
before this is it's a it's a different
 
before this is it's a it's a different
feeling of of pressure than it is when
 
feeling of of pressure than it is when
you're in an operating role and
 
you're in an operating role and
literally you're looking at you know the
 
literally you're looking at you know the
bank account balance going hey can we
 
bank account balance going hey can we
make payroll at the end of the month you
 
make payroll at the end of the month you
know it's it's it's a different feeling
 
know it's it's it's a different feeling
um I think that the biggest thing from a
 
um I think that the biggest thing from a
pressure standpoint over here is just
 
pressure standpoint over here is just
when you're in an advisory role again
 
when you're in an advisory role again
you're you're operating by influence you
 
you're you're operating by influence you
don't really have control over the
 
don't really have control over the
situation but yet your your your own
 
situation but yet your your your own
success I think both personally how I
 
success I think both personally how I
measure myself and also you know to a
 
measure myself and also you know to a
degree how we measure you know ourselves
 
degree how we measure you know ourselves
here at the firm too is based on the
 
here at the firm too is based on the
success of these things so you're
 
success of these things so you're
basically measuring success against
 
basically measuring success against
things that you don't have control over
 
things that you don't have control over
and I think that's the essence of the
 
and I think that's the essence of the
difficulty of the advisor role when you
 
difficulty of the advisor role when you
feel pressure at times you're like hey I
 
feel pressure at times you're like hey I
think this is how this should go this is
 
think this is how this should go this is
what I would do if I were in your
 
what I would do if I were in your
situation but at the same time I can't
 
situation but at the same time I can't
go make you do that um and look we take
 
go make you do that um and look we take
a lot of ownership in what we do working
 
a lot of ownership in what we do working
with the portfolio because we're really
 
with the portfolio because we're really
involved with you know all of you very
 
involved with you know all of you very
closely on a day-to-day basis and part
 
closely on a day-to-day basis and part
of the reason we're able to do that is
 
of the reason we're able to do that is
we have such a large team we're able to
 
we have such a large team we're able to
be proactive we're not just running
 
be proactive we're not just running
around reactively putting out fires like
 
around reactively putting out fires like

least four sometimes up more months
 
least four sometimes up more months
upwards sometimes of a year on the whole
 
upwards sometimes of a year on the whole
process so there's a tremendous sense of
 
process so there's a tremendous sense of
ownership that comes with that and a
 
ownership that comes with that and a
tremendous sense of responsibility and
 
tremendous sense of responsibility and
pressure it feels to make sure that's
 
pressure it feels to make sure that's
done right even though I'm only in an
 
done right even though I'm only in an
advisory capacity so that that's a big
 
advisory capacity so that that's a big
part of it for me honestly in terms of
 
part of it for me honestly in terms of
probably more self-induced pressure in
 
probably more self-induced pressure in

question because you're essentially
 
question because you're essentially
betting in I think the difference is
 
betting in I think the difference is
you're having to buy into a different
 
you're having to buy into a different
kind of
 
kind of
potential so you know the potential
 
potential so you know the potential
you're buying into is their ability to
 
you're buying into is their ability to
learn your product and learn your
 
learn your product and learn your
business which is different than the

they're very good go to market they're
 
they're very good go to market they're
very good at finance and you're near
 
very good at finance and you're near

you're merely betting on them to
progress and Ascend in both the scope
 
progress and Ascend in both the scope

leader so it's almost the exact inverse
where you're already bringing someone in
 
where you're already bringing someone in
who's very good on the leadership in the
 
who's very good on the leadership in the
soft skill side but now you need to bet
 
soft skill side but now you need to bet
