messages later like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm
gonna have some work to do in front of
 
gonna have some work to do in front of
me tonight. But I think in general what
 
me tonight. But I think in general what
I thought was really awesome was the
 
I thought was really awesome was the
expo hall. Like expo hall was sick this
 
expo hall. Like expo hall was sick this
year and like you're given where we are
 
year and like you're given where we are
with HR technology and AI specifically,
 
with HR technology and AI specifically,
you know, you can kind of like go up and
 
you know, you can kind of like go up and
like what are you guys doing? Like give
 
like what are you guys doing? Like give
me a demo like who your C and you just
 
me a demo like who your C and you just
you can do it so much faster and so much
 
you can do it so much faster and so much
more organically than like a full sales
 
more organically than like a full sales
process which I really liked and I had
 
process which I really liked and I had
historically not liked the expo hall so
 
historically not liked the expo hall so
I thought that was awesome. Obviously
 
I thought that was awesome. Obviously
like the dinners and stuff like that is
 
like the dinners and stuff like that is
like really where the magic happens. You
 
like really where the magic happens. You
know, my big take is like when you get
 
know, my big take is like when you get
people into these more intimate
 
people into these more intimate
settings, they're just way more
 
settings, they're just way more
authentic and real and less
 
authentic and real and less
performative. And I think in HR, we are
 
performative. And I think in HR, we are
really yearning for more of that amongst
 
really yearning for more of that amongst
ourselves. And so I think that's that
 
ourselves. And so I think that's that
was really cool. And then the other
 
was really cool. And then the other
thing is that, you know, the feedback on
 
thing is that, you know, the feedback on
the show was really positive.
 
the show was really positive.
The things that I heard was, you know,
 
The things that I heard was, you know,
you guys are actually like talking about
 
you guys are actually like talking about
the real stuff in a friendly like you
 
the real stuff in a friendly like you
guys have good banter and so like you
 
guys have good banter and so like you
know, you guys push each other on
 
know, you guys push each other on
things, but like you're talking about
 
things, but like you're talking about
the things that I'm thinking about. And
 
the things that I'm thinking about. And
so this is outside of my talking to my
 
so this is outside of my talking to my
own friends. This is where I go to get
 
own friends. This is where I go to get
that feedback and those insights. The
 
that feedback and those insights. The
other thing I heard is people love the
 
other thing I heard is people love the
short segments. So we'll keep those
 
short segments. So we'll keep those
coming. That was a Kelly idea. And so,
 
coming. That was a Kelly idea. And so,
you know, instead of doing three-hour
 
you know, instead of doing three-hour
podcasts, which it turns out nobody has
 
podcasts, which it turns out nobody has
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time for, uh, these are much
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time for, uh, these are much
better. And then the last piece of
 
better. And then the last piece of
feedback I heard was, "Nolan, you're
 
feedback I heard was, "Nolan, you're
really tall." Um, so like for those of
 
really tall." Um, so like for those of

kind of tall, dude. It's like I just
called him a stork. I mean, the guy is
 
called him a stork. I mean, the guy is
like very tall, very lean, and so it can
 
like very tall, very lean, and so it can
be a little alarming for folks that are
 
be a little alarming for folks that are
are used to seeing you sitting down. So,
 
are used to seeing you sitting down. So,
I love that. Well, for what it's worth,
 
I love that. Well, for what it's worth,
my high school baseball coach called me
 
my high school baseball coach called me
big bird. Yeah. Well, there you go. You
 
big bird. Yeah. Well, there you go. You
guys can call me that now, too. All
 
guys can call me that now, too. All
right, let's get into this deal and
 
right, let's get into this deal and
rippling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane drama. So, I
 
rippling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane drama. So, I
will do my best to set the scene and
 
will do my best to set the scene and
bear with me because these details are
 
bear with me because these details are
extensive and stranger than fiction in
 
extensive and stranger than fiction in
some
 
some
cases. So, essentially what Ripling is
 
cases. So, essentially what Ripling is
alleging is that Deal had I will
 
alleging is that Deal had I will
describe it as like a like a spy planted
 
describe it as like a like a spy planted
a spy inside of Ripling's office in
 
a spy inside of Ripling's office in
Dublin. And this person had full access
 
Dublin. And this person had full access
to Ripling's CRM. And so anytime Ripling
 
to Ripling's CRM. And so anytime Ripling
was trying to poach a deal customer, the
 
was trying to poach a deal customer, the
sales rep would pass the intel all to
 
sales rep would pass the intel all to
deal. So, and that included things like
 
deal. So, and that included things like
the proposal, the pricing, like
 
the proposal, the pricing, like
everything. And so, anytime Ripling was
 
everything. And so, anytime Ripling was
in a competitive process with Deal, the
 
in a competitive process with Deal, the
sales rep would share all of those
 
sales rep would share all of those
details with Deal. Right? So, this is
 
details with Deal. Right? So, this is
essentially like a double agent, right?
 
essentially like a double agent, right?
Like inside of the company and then
 
Like inside of the company and then
passing information back. Now, the way
 
passing information back. Now, the way
Ripling figured it out is honestly like
 
Ripling figured it out is honestly like
this reads from the show Homeland. Do
 
this reads from the show Homeland. Do
you ever watch that, Kelly? That's a
 
you ever watch that, Kelly? That's a
great show. That's a great show. I
 
great show. That's a great show. I
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that show. Okay, so this is
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that show. Okay, so this is
It's not going anymore, but No, it's not
 
It's not going anymore, but No, it's not
going anymore. It's like worth like, you
 
going anymore. It's like worth like, you
know, if you get through seasons like
 
know, if you get through seasons like
three and four, which is a little weird.
 
three and four, which is a little weird.
It gets really good at the end. So, they
 
It gets really good at the end. So, they
used what they call a honeypot. And I
 
used what they call a honeypot. And I
had never heard of this before. And so
 
had never heard of this before. And so
this is exactly what it was. So in early
 
this is exactly what it was. So in early
March, Ripley's general counsel sent a
 
March, Ripley's general counsel sent a
letter to three leaders at Deal. Their
 
letter to three leaders at Deal. Their
CFO, their head of legal, and an
 
CFO, their head of legal, and an
employment attorney that deal uses. and
 
employment attorney that deal uses. and
they basically said, "Hey, there was a
 
they basically said, "Hey, there was a
screenshot in there referencing a Slack
 
screenshot in there referencing a Slack
channel that they had no one was using
 
channel that they had no one was using
that they had created in the hopes that
 
that they had created in the hopes that
deals leadership team would see it, tell
 
deals leadership team would see it, tell
the double agent, and then the double
 
the double agent, and then the double
agent would go figure out what's
 
agent would go figure out what's
happening inside the Slack channel."
 
happening inside the Slack channel."
Now, the craziest part about who was who
 
Now, the craziest part about who was who
they emailed this to. So, deals CEO's
 
they emailed this to. So, deals CEO's
dad is the board chair, the CFO, and the
 
dad is the board chair, the CFO, and the
GC. He was on this letter. So, what
 
GC. He was on this letter. So, what
they're alleging is that literally the
 
they're alleging is that literally the
CEO's father, who was also on the
 
CEO's father, who was also on the
leadership team, was the person that was
 
leadership team, was the person that was
alerting the double agent inside of
 
alerting the double agent inside of
Ripling. So then what happened was the
 
Ripling. So then what happened was the
Rippling well the deal employee inside
 
Rippling well the deal employee inside
of Rippling went and started to they
 
of Rippling went and started to they
took the bait and they started to go
 
took the bait and they started to go
look for this Slack channel
 
look for this Slack channel
and I think it was like 20 times this
 
and I think it was like 20 times this
person started searching Slack and they
 
person started searching Slack and they
have like the Excel list in the
 
have like the Excel list in the
complaint for how many times they did
 
complaint for how many times they did
it. So Kelly, what is your take on this
 
it. So Kelly, what is your take on this
situation? Oh my gosh. Well, first of
 
situation? Oh my gosh. Well, first of
all, that's not a honeypot. That's like
 
all, that's not a honeypot. That's like
a mouse trap. That is like it's
 
a mouse trap. That is like it's
contrived slam.
 
contrived slam.
Um, very
 
Um, very
layered. Very layered. And this was,
 
layered. Very layered. And this was,
remember we we talked about this a while
 
remember we we talked about this a while
back in in April of 24, right? Rippling
 
back in in April of 24, right? Rippling
did a secondary tender offer and they
 
did a secondary tender offer and they
were the ones that were cutting out
 
were the ones that were cutting out
former employees that went to
 
former employees that went to
competitors from liquidating any of
 
competitors from liquidating any of
their shares to get, you know, cash
 
their shares to get, you know, cash
because Yeah, we were hard on them at
 
because Yeah, we were hard on them at
that time. Yeah, we were hard on them at
 
that time. Yeah, we were hard on them at
that time because we're like, "Oh, come
 
that time because we're like, "Oh, come
on. People go work for competitors all
 
on. People go work for competitors all
the time sort of thing." Totally. And we
 
the time sort of thing." Totally. And we
had never seen that and we were like,
 
had never seen that and we were like,
"Well, they have every right to do
 
"Well, they have every right to do
that." And I mean compared to what's
 
that." And I mean compared to what's
happening with what you just described,
 
happening with what you just described,
that was like a Swedish massage. You
 
that was like a Swedish massage. You
know what I mean? Totally. So, exactly.
 
know what I mean? Totally. So, exactly.
This is really layered. I mean, my first
 
This is really layered. I mean, my first
question
 
question
maybe that that folks might be maybe um
 
maybe that that folks might be maybe um
thinking about is how does one actually
 
thinking about is how does one actually
plant a spy? What is that? Are they
 
plant a spy? What is that? Are they
employees of both companies and yeah,
 
employees of both companies and yeah,
Ripling failed to catch it in a
 
Ripling failed to catch it in a
background check? Like what how does
 
background check? Like what how does
that even happen in the first place? I
 
that even happen in the first place? I
think that this is way more common than
 
think that this is way more common than
people think.
 
people think.
So I'll try I had a situation like this
 
So I'll try I had a situation like this
in my career and so I'll try and do it
 
in my career and so I'll try and do it
I'll try and give details without you
 
I'll try and give details without you
know removing
 
know removing
all an anonymity. So, we had a situation
 
all an anonymity. So, we had a situation
to where an employes's relative was a
 
to where an employes's relative was a
higher up at a competitor and we ended
 
higher up at a competitor and we ended
up finding on that person's laptop that
 
up finding on that person's laptop that
they were screenshotting things that
 
they were screenshotting things that
were confidential information to the
 
were confidential information to the
company and sending them to the
 
company and sending them to the
relative.
 
relative.
Now, I'm not going to get into like how
 
Now, I'm not going to get into like how
we found out and like what all that
 
we found out and like what all that
stuff happens, but ultimately I think
 
stuff happens, but ultimately I think
this is not uncommon. And then number
 
this is not uncommon. And then number
two is you know there was that meme
 
two is you know there was that meme
during the pandemic which was like oh
 
during the pandemic which was like oh
the engineers are holding two jobs and
 
the engineers are holding two jobs and
like don't do anything. Well this is the
 
like don't do anything. Well this is the
situation to where companies are being
 
situation to where companies are being
you know very manipulative and contrived
 
you know very manipulative and contrived
and saying like well actually yeah go
 
and saying like well actually yeah go
hold two jobs but like go in there and
 
hold two jobs but like go in there and
figure out what's going on and funnel it
 
figure out what's going on and funnel it
back to me. I will tell you much much
 
back to me. I will tell you much much
earlier in my career, we wanted to learn
 
earlier in my career, we wanted to learn
about other interview
 
about other interview
processes and how competitors were
 
processes and how competitors were
assessing candidates. And so I have
 
assessing candidates. And so I have
personally seen like dropping in like
 
personally seen like dropping in like
one of our AEES into a competitive AE
 
one of our AEES into a competitive AE
process to go learn about that. Now, I
 
process to go learn about that. Now, I
don't think that that's as, you know,
 
don't think that that's as, you know,
that doesn't cross a moral boundary for
 
that doesn't cross a moral boundary for
me because like that is more public
 
me because like that is more public
information or publicish information,
 
information or publicish information,
but I don't think that this stuff is
 
but I don't think that this stuff is
new. I just think to the degree that
 
new. I just think to the degree that
we're seeing it right now is
 
we're seeing it right now is
crazy. Yeah. I mean, and the honeypot
 
crazy. Yeah. I mean, and the honeypot
scheme that was very complex. I mean,
 
scheme that was very complex. I mean,
just to think through that and work
 
just to think through that and work
through that and then this this spy, I
 
through that and then this this spy, I
mean, they were there, you know, they
 
mean, they were there, you know, they
were like almost at the finish line here
 
were like almost at the finish line here
and then search search 20 searches in
 
and then search search 20 searches in
Slack. So, if I'm thinking like an
 
Slack. So, if I'm thinking like an
oceans 11 criminal, that's kind of an
 
oceans 11 criminal, that's kind of an
idiot move is to do that. I mean, yeah,
 
idiot move is to do that. I mean, yeah,
it is. I think the bigger thing here, so
 
it is. I think the bigger thing here, so
I have a couple friends that work at
 
I have a couple friends that work at
Ripling and you know when people go work
 
Ripling and you know when people go work
for HR techch companies and I'm their
 
for HR techch companies and I'm their
friend, they typically hit me like, "Oh,
 
friend, they typically hit me like, "Oh,
what do you think about this company?"
 
what do you think about this company?"
And every single time one of my friends
 
And every single time one of my friends
is interviewing at Ripling, I'm like,
 
is interviewing at Ripling, I'm like,
"Look, they have a good product. It
 
"Look, they have a good product. It
continues to get better. Their CEO,
 
continues to get better. Their CEO,
Parker Conrad, has gone through a lot in
 
Parker Conrad, has gone through a lot in
his life, and this is somebody who I
 
his life, and this is somebody who I
would never want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with. Like, I
 
would never want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with. Like, I
would never want Parker on my bad side."
 
would never want Parker on my bad side."
And I literally tell that to every
 
And I literally tell that to every
single friend that goes over there. And
 
single friend that goes over there. And
so the story I tell myself, which I
 
so the story I tell myself, which I
don't have any data on, but I'm just
 
don't have any data on, but I'm just
telling you like this is what I tell
 
telling you like this is what I tell
myself, is that they had an inkling this
 
myself, is that they had an inkling this
was happening, right? And so Parker, I
 
was happening, right? And so Parker, I
mean, he's a he's a savant and I'm
 
mean, he's a he's a savant and I'm
assuming that he's all over this thing
 
assuming that he's all over this thing
because he's got an intuition. It's
 
because he's got an intuition. It's
going down. And so they designed this
 
going down. And so they designed this
scheme and then, you know, the master
 
scheme and then, you know, the master
stroke is not just the scheme to figure
 
stroke is not just the scheme to figure
out what's going on. It's going mega
 
out what's going on. It's going mega
public with it on Twitter. Mega like for
 
public with it on Twitter. Mega like for
him to post the actual screenshots of
 
him to post the actual screenshots of
the complaints and then to summarize it
 
the complaints and then to summarize it
in a tweet thread. That part is brand
 
in a tweet thread. That part is brand
new and we have never seen that. And
 
new and we have never seen that. And
that is an example of leveraging modern
 
that is an example of leveraging modern
media to make a point because now
 
media to make a point because now
nobody's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with rippling on
 
nobody's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with rippling on
stuff like this anymore. Yeah, I wrote I
 
stuff like this anymore. Yeah, I wrote I
actually wrote that down. I think, you
 
actually wrote that down. I think, you
know, let's just, you know, backwards
 
know, let's just, you know, backwards
eight years from now, kind of what would
 
eight years from now, kind of what would
have happened. Oh, some Valentine's Day
 
have happened. Oh, some Valentine's Day
nasty Graham from their legal team on
 
nasty Graham from their legal team on
paper that doesn't go anywhere. Like,
 
paper that doesn't go anywhere. Like,
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is different now. And that's
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is different now. And that's
technology.
 
technology.
That is people getting smarter with
 
That is people getting smarter with
technology. That is social media and the
 
technology. That is social media and the
amplification of that. I think AI is
 
amplification of that. I think AI is
going to like play a lot into this in
 
going to like play a lot into this in
the future. Like I think this will be
 
the future. Like I think this will be
kind of the new norm out there
 
kind of the new norm out there
and I think it's going to shift a lot of

And so my biggest takeaway here, you
 
And so my biggest takeaway here, you
know, we also earlier in my career, we
 
know, we also earlier in my career, we
faced an employee litigation suit. And
 
faced an employee litigation suit. And
one of the things that we were talking
 
one of the things that we were talking
about, and I think we were a little
 
about, and I think we were a little
early for our time when we were talking
 
early for our time when we were talking
about it was like, do you settle and
 
about it was like, do you settle and
just make it go away even though you
 
just make it go away even though you
know you didn't do anything wrong or do
 
know you didn't do anything wrong or do
you fight it and do you make an example
 
you fight it and do you make an example
of that person so nobody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you
 
of that person so nobody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you
ever again?
 
ever again?
And I feel like we've now entered an era
 
And I feel like we've now entered an era
that CEOs want to go to war because, you
 
that CEOs want to go to war because, you
know, they feel like they haven't done
 
know, they feel like they haven't done
anything wrong. Um, and often times they
 
anything wrong. Um, and often times they
haven't. Like, you know, these these
 
haven't. Like, you know, these these
closed door conversations are very
 
closed door conversations are very
complex, right, Kelly? You've been a
 
complex, right, Kelly? You've been a
part of them. You've seen these things.
 
part of them. You've seen these things.
You know, certainly many companies don't
 
You know, certainly many companies don't
act the right way and they should be
 
act the right way and they should be
called out and they should be punished
 
called out and they should be punished
for those things. But we have entered a
 
for those things. But we have entered a
world to where there's a lot of
 
world to where there's a lot of
latigiousness. There's a lot of like
 
latigiousness. There's a lot of like
coming for companies and I think CEOs
 
coming for companies and I think CEOs
have had enough and so you got to be
 
have had enough and so you got to be
really careful about the fights you pick
 
really careful about the fights you pick
now especially with like CEOs like this
 
now especially with like CEOs like this
and it sets a message for me which is
 
and it sets a message for me which is
never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with rippling. Yeah. I think
 
never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with rippling. Yeah. I think
just to double down on that theme and
 
just to double down on that theme and
kind of take it broader. I think the
 
kind of take it broader. I think the
next phase of work and tech and all this
 
next phase of work and tech and all this
is achen to the theme of things are just
 
is achen to the theme of things are just
out there more now. Whether it's this,
 
out there more now. Whether it's this,
whether it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a show like this,
 
whether it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a show like this,
would we have done a show like this 10
 
would we have done a show like this 10
years ago? No shot. Zero shot. No
 
years ago? No shot. Zero shot. No
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way. And so I think what you're
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way. And so I think what you're
seeing is
 
seeing is
just not even a tolerance, but you know,
 
just not even a tolerance, but you know,
appetite for once taboo conversations or
 
appetite for once taboo conversations or
examples or hush hush latigious things.
 
examples or hush hush latigious things.
No one cares. I mean, everyone's just
 
No one cares. I mean, everyone's just
kind of wearing it on their sleeve now
 
kind of wearing it on their sleeve now
and talking about it and using social
 
and talking about it and using social
media. And I think a lot of times that's
 
media. And I think a lot of times that's
good. Sometimes it's not good. Other
 
good. Sometimes it's not good. Other
times it's distracting. Other times it's
 
times it's distracting. Other times it's
helpful. It's very confusing and that's
 
helpful. It's very confusing and that's
okay. But I think no matter what it is,
 
okay. But I think no matter what it is,
it's happening. That's such a great
 
it's happening. That's such a great
point. I follow Lulu Chen on Twitter and
 
point. I follow Lulu Chen on Twitter and
you know just like following her, which
 
you know just like following her, which
everyone should follow her because I
 
everyone should follow her because I
feel like we are in this new era to your
 
feel like we are in this new era to your
point, Kelly, to where you have to be
 
point, Kelly, to where you have to be
social media native. Like you have to
 
social media native. Like you have to
understand how to use these things to
 
understand how to use these things to
your advantage. Like the ones you posted

she's like, "They're missing the moment.
