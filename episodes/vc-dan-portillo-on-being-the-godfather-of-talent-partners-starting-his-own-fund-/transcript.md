# VC Dan Portillo on being the Godfather of Talent Partners, Starting his Own Fund, + Experimentation

## Transcript

 
I was invited to the partner meetings
and I got to sit and look at what was
happening inside the firm and they wrote
down their investment process and then
the investment process was like
identify
evaluate sell close make successful I'm
like that is a recruiting process like
it's actually the exact same process
that we're running I wanted to really
impact the core business and so I had
this personal goal that I wanted 20% of
the Investments That Greylock made to
come through the work that the town team

did hey everybody welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast where we get into the
real talk of company construction these
are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and board members behind closed doors
we're Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially
with people but on the show we tell the
truth and expect the same from our
guests this week's guest is Dan portio I
refer to Dan as the Godfather of VC
Talent Partners he's now building his
own fund with a one-of-a-kind value
proposition that prioritizes Talent we
get into the deep details about how VC
and VC Talent Partners operate it's an
influential world that most people who
work in Venture actually don't
understand along the way we hear stories
from Journey about Reed Hoffman John
Lily and Howard Schultz we also talk
about back channels finding success as
an advisor and the necessary skill of
framing new ideas as experiments without
further Ado here's our conversation with
Dan Dan Boro thank you so much for
joining us you are a legend in Silicon
Valley I refer to you as the Godfather
of talent Partners um you were at
Mozilla as the 20th employee there you
were at Greylock as the talent partner
there and building the Greylock team and
now you've gone off to be a venture
partner at the GP thanks so much for
being with us oh thank you for having me
Godfather makes me sound old but uh I
appreciate it thanks you don't have that
many Grays I think you're looking pretty
good yeah old and wise old and wise I'd
love to start at Mozilla you were the
 
what was your job and how did like the
talent thing end up working out there uh
so the way that I ended up at muzilla so
I worked for a company called cun it was
this really tiny startup the CEO was a
guy is a guy named ARF halali who became
a partner at seoa Our IT guy now runs
verly he's a CEO of verly um multiple
like a VP at figma a VP at
Salesforce um one of the partners that I
work with oh and then a guy named shrap
who became the CTO of Facebook so this
company got bought for like $50 million
but like the talent diaspora went went
everywhere and so John Lil was part of
the VC fund that created uh Center run
and so he called me and said hey I'm
joining this company Mozilla um shrap is
also joining would you consider joining
us and so I was like all right this
sounds great I would love to join and so
I ended up joining as one of the very
first employees there was a there was no
recruiting at that point so everyone
that they hired had come out of
previously working at Netscape or were
community members at uh working on
Firefox and so to give you an idea like
none of the engineers had
calendars so you can schedule interviews
you couldn't do like they just basically
had IRC which is basically the precursor
for slack and we couldn't use any
Microsoft products so it was it was even
pre Zimbra so we're using some other
like weird email thing because Milla a
new org and so I basically had to
convince everyone that guess what we
need calendars because there's no way we
can schedule interviews if we don't have
ways of people knowing when they're
supposed to show up the things so I was
like literally printing like reses and
schedules and putting them on people's
desk to get them to like show up yeah so
stage um it's so part of the challenges
and and things that I really enjoyed
about Mozilla is it's a very
mission-driven organization there are
nonprofit um very strong values and then
part the part and then high high
technical expectations and what we
needed to figure out is like how do we
hire people that have um the same skills
abilities but don't come out of the
community because a lot of the community
members did not have the required
technical skill and what we kept finding
is there were're pissing off community
members by interviewing them and not
hiring them and so I spent time with um
the engineers uh that had been there for
a long time like from the pre uh Mula
days that came from Netscape to look for
like what were they looking for in
people uh and to give you an idea so the
CTO of of Mozilla is a guy named Brendan
Ike that created JavaScript and now you
know is the founder of the Brave browser
and so very very high technical bar and
so going through like all right well
what do we need to hire in people to get
them to fit in this role and what we
kind of dissected was all right they
needed to be incredibly technically
strong they had to be a very diverse
from a technical background so no one
that just loved a particular language
they needed to be able to pick the right
tools and the right language to solve
the right particular problem uh
and having a strong like Mission Orient
orientation and we also needed people
that were strong systems programmers and
that also love the web so at the time
you kind of had like lightweight web
programmers or you had hardcore C++
people you didn't really have people
that kind of stretched between the two
and so a lot of the work was like trying
to find people that bridged both strong
systems programming and and uh
understanding of the web Dan I back to
the scaling of Mozilla I tend to think
about this hypers scale has two sides of
one coin the HR side and the recruiting
side you were there for both and usually
the recruiting side goes first boom
let's higher let's higher let's higher H
how did that org side catch up or did it
or was it there was a Chasm between
growing that how did you see that so uh
so we ran recruiting first so I ran
recruiting and I set that up and I
wouldn't say we hit like hypers scale
like I joined at 20 and they were
probably about 500 when when I kind of
moved on to the next thing um but we I
was probably a couple years in and John
Lily the CEO came and said you can do
anything you want at this company except
write code like tell me the job that you
want and let's figure it out and so I
spent a lot of time thinking about it
and I I I often think of recruiting as
the promise that you make to someone
about the job that you're taking and
then as like the HR or the people
function as the delivery of that promise
and so I ended up taking over uh the
recruiting and HR for for for Mozilla
and uh I'm happy to go into detail I
don't know how interesting it would be
for folks but the very first thing that
they gave me was our performance
evaluation process and so we ran it once
a
year and at the end of it everyone got a
one two or three if you got a three
you're you know on a performance plan if
you got a one you got a 7 to 10% range
so a raise so the high performers were
never really happy with what they got
from a comp perspective and we were
spending a bunch of time just shutting
down the org like once a year and
so I started spending some time on that
process and I talked to Bob Sutton who's
a professor at Stanford who wrote the no
 Rule and he's a friend of John's
so I was like I went to him and said I
think that this process doesn't make any
sense and it's actually probably doing
more harm than good to the
organization uh the next morning John
Lily comes into my office and says have
you read Bob's blog this morning and I
said no they didn't he's like well you
should and then after you read it let me
know what we're going to do about it so
um Bob posted that young HR I was young
then like it it was a long time ago so
young HR executive says performance
reviews do more harm than good and so
but he didn't name me he didn't call me
out by name but he like talked about
like the set of things that we talked
about and and then put it into an
article and I'm sure I can find it like
some where but I went to John and then
started thinking about like all right
well how did we want to manage
performance and is this once a year
cycle actually what we want to do um we
ended up creating a leveling structure
and doing basically something similar to
what Google does now and looking not
making it about performance reviews and
really focusing on um people moving
between levels so showing them what they
needed to do to move from you know L2 to
L3 and then managing our performance
against how they were doing against
level and so that way if people are
moving in their career very quickly I
could give them multiple raises in a
given year and then if people you know
we're doing good work and it's fine we
could just kind of focus on managing the
top 10% and the bottom 10% and leave you
know the middle you know most of the
middle alone wait so so Bob is the guy
who had no role and then
completely outs you like that that seems
a little contradictory to me he did not
say my name he did not my name and
actually the best thing he could have
done for me so I uh but it definitely
created a lot of work for the next like
few months after that so on the leveling
piece right now I feel like there's a
push against levels I actually talked to
a lot of Founders who are like I hate
levels and I want to like get rid of
them what's your take on it given that
you were part of the people that
instituted
this um well that existed before like
before like that had been around for a
long time I I think we did it in a in a
unique way and I think the way that we
managed how we thought about
compensation rela to that was was
probably
unique I think they're helpful for
understanding um and for helping people
navigate their careers and then you know
there's a difference between a staff
engineer and a regular engineer and like
most of the engineers that we have at
the GP are at least staff if not senior
staff or principal and so the amount of
responsibility that someone at that
level can take for their org is
different and I think it's it's help to
understand that in how you hire and to
say we need to hire people at a
particular type of experience and a type
of impact and that's hard to do without
understanding
levels how that how that actually had
like the other side of that is inside
the organization there's a bunch of
arguing about what level people are and
then you got to manage against it so it
does create work if you make those
levels apparent but I think you have to
understand when you're hiring and if
you're hiring that but you don't
necessarily have to have an internal
leveling system in your
organization you know until you're much
bigger and then you have to think about
promotions I would say what's happened
over the last couple years between covid
and the markets like HR and performance
and like giving people massages and back
rubs probably gone to the to the Wayside
and so I think orgs have been saved a
lot of work on having to think about
Career Development I think I mean just
to take a pause and no one would love
your feedback too I mean you started at
mozzilla in 2005 it's 20 years ago and
we're still I mean The Godfather right
but we're still ping ponging back levels
no levels performance reviews no it's
it's fascinating to me a lot of folks
are still in search for the answer the
right way and there just isn't one uh I
agree we we actually don't do any
performance work at the fund we actually
are basic very actively managed in how
we think about deliverables and it's
very very deliverables oriented so we
don't do that I will say that like
whatever thing you choose will cause
problems that you have to like like fix
and address and so what you'll see you
see reorgs and large companies all the
time and so you have verticalized
Solutions where like product management
basically is vertically align all the
way up like the org and so then the
problem that that creates is like you
don't really have this sense of team and
so then you'll see the organization then
flip to lines of businesses and that
creates like little fums and so the
question is like all right well which
problem do we want to deal with first
and like which one's going to be harder
and then then being aware what problem
I'm actually creating for myself in the
future and and and how do I want to
address that it's
tradeoffs it's always trade-offs and
then I'm sure at Greylock and your seven
years I'd love to hear the story of how
you parlayed into Greylock in that
Journey because I'm sure those years
were formative too yeah happy too so I I
was at Milla I think about five five
years so this was probably about year
four um Josh mcfar who's a partner at
Greylock now um was starting a company
that they funded they were looking at
bringing in a talent partner uh Josh
referred me in I met with a few folks it
was good meetings kind of felt that they
wanted me to go recruit NBAs at Harvard
and that was not really what I wanted to
spend my time doing nothing against like
Harvard NBAs it's just not like how I
wanted to spend my time uh and then I
went to John uh John le who is my boss
at Milla and still like my biggest
mentor to this day we have calls like
every two weeks and said hey like what
do you know about Greylock uh is this
something I should take
seriously and he said if you stay I'll
make you a VP but you should go talk to
Reed Hoffman who was on the board of
Milla and because he knows them very
well because Greylock had funded uh
LinkedIn in the early days so I got to
go to Reed Hoffman's house and sat down
with him and talked to him about the
opportunity and shared my concerns about
you know recruiting NBAs isn't really
want I want to do like I'm really
thinking about this from a network
perspective and what are the
opportunities when you have a network a
company versus a single company and he
said well look John will kill me but if
you want like I need a BP of HR at
LinkedIn so this is you know 2010 uh and
I said I can't handle any more like
decisions like I need to like focus and
narrow things down I tend to want to
oversimplify things to as few variables
as possible and then Reed said there's a
nonzero chance that I'm going to go to
Greylock and I was too embarrassed to
ask what that meant and so I decided to
take the VP job at Milla soon after
after Reed announced that he was joining
Greylock and then John Lily announced
that he was joining Greylock and then
they had hired someone else to work in
that role and so I started thinking
about like what was next for me and I
had advising an HR company called Ripple
so a lot of the work that I'd been doing
in HR led to finding the right solution
I found this small team in Toronto that
was doing some unique HR work and they
started building a solution for us they
made me an offer to be the first US
employee and open up the office here and
we're getting some interesting traction
we were running like all of Facebook's
performance reviews and we were talking
to Hulu and Linkedin and so I joined to
uh run customer success it was a really
valuable learning experience for me
probably the most that I've ever learned
in in any amount of time in my career
kind of my working MBA it was the most
stressful time of my life that I've ever
had because I've learned that I don't
like not being good at things like I
went to one salsa class with my mom and
sucks so I took 25 private lessons like
that is the kind of individual that
you're you're dealing with and so it was
incredibly stressful I think I did a
good job
um and you know my wife my now wife and
I were engaged and I think the amount of
stress and loss of sleep and eventually
I reconnected with John Lily we were
having lunch and he said hey we want to
kind of rethink what we're doing from a
talent perspective will you reconsider a
role like graylock and I said sure I'm
happy to do it so I came in had a few
conversations and it moved like pretty
quickly and I had a lot of trust with
John who's been a good friend and Reed
basically said came into the meeting he
says I'm here exclusively to recruit you
to come take this job so like will you
come here and so Reed Hoffman asked you
to do something you don't say no twice
so um so I ended up joining Greylock was
a hell of a run I always think of you as
like the model of what a good talent
partner looks like I remember you and I
had a conversation I think it was in
 
me about you know the first recruiter
role at figma and I was like what the
hell is Dan talking about with like this
design compan you so rich right now I'm
an idiot if that proves anything you
were so right um shame on me that said
Greylock had so many incredible
companies that they backed and you were
instrumental in working with a lot of
these Founders like what was that
experience like for you what like it it
was you know you got to work with Kevin
cam when he was starting Instagram there
were eight people place like their head
of infra their head of or their head of
infrastructure their head of Sr I'm
getting to work with him now on artifact
like I've got a chance to work with like
so many amazing people and you know
Dylan was basically straight out of
brown when we started working with him
on figma for me it was like how do we
jump in how do we provide the most
amount of value for a Founder how do we
help them accelerate a lot of their
critical hiring and then put them on a
path for success and so my model well
actually how I got started at Greylock
there was no job description basically
the job was like come here and make us
look good in front of in in front of
other opportunities so it's easier to
close Investments but no one told me
that that was the job so what I did was
I spoke with each of the investors and
asked them about uh what was important
to them and a pattern emerged so the
pattern was I'm interested in whatever I
just invested in yesterday and whatever
I think is going to be worth the most
amount of money money so I went and met
with each of those companies and the
most amount of money companies were
tended to be like breakout growth stage
companies and so most of the work that
they needed was programmatic like a
university program some training um some
things that you could actually do at
scale and all of the new Investments
basically just needed first engineers
and and being able to kind of build that
that founding team around them so we
basically oriented almost all the work
around new companies coming in so I had
um we had a doc with every investor
their P1 and their P2 company and then
their other Investments and we Orient
oriented everything around the P1 so
company would come in we'd write an
executive summary we'd work on key roles
we'd knock out a handful of positions
bring in a recruiter send them on their
way and so at the time like my job was
to try and know everyone every great
person like you Nolan from a recruiting
perspective CU like my job got
fundamentally easier if the person
running recruiting in each one of the
companies was exceptional cuz then we
could just focus on sourcing and then
throwing them like high quality talent
and then they could run with it hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after a word from our sponsors hey
everybody your co-host Nolan here high

comom Dan the the years you were
Greylock were kind of like my Fairway
Bullseye years of Adventure when I kind
of started I'm still in it but a lot
happened in those seven years between
 
what would you say were kind of your aha
moments with exec hiring or or other um
in those time frames as far as how the
industry shifted or changed so uh there
was two Talent Partners I ran what we
called core Talent which was everything
from Unity to senior director and then
there was Jeff marwitz who ran all of
the exact side of the house like very
well-known kind of like one of the best
in the industry I think their role is a
bit different I think a lot of what
exact search ends up like not to
disparage it but tends to be like having
handing out searches to the right search
firms to work on the right rules and
make sure they get done and then our job
was a bit more operational of company
goes in knock it out rolls put the
recruiter get out like move into the
next one is a little more kind of like
Special Forces and then the exact
partner is more like managing an army of
like you know and being able to get onto
the search schedule of the top search
firms which is in itself like a very
important
skill so if I think about the phases of
my career at Greylock so like phase one
was like figure out what the hell to do
in this job and like that was you know
talking to Partners talking to companies
figuring out their needs the second
phase was delivering against that and
being able to deliver against it
consistently and having the right team
to be able to do that so that we had you
know to be very referenceable with our
portfolio companies and then a few years
in you know I became a partner I wasn't
hired as a partner I was invited to the
partner meetings and I got to sit and
look at what was happening inside the
firm and they wrote down their
investment process and then the
investment process was like
identify
evaluate sell close make successful I'm
like that is a recruiting process like
it's actually the exact same process
that we're running I wanted to really
impact the core business and so I had
this personal goal that I wanted 20% of
the Investments That Greylock made to
come through the work that the town team
did and my way of impacting that was say
like Ventures fundamentally a network
business and so if we can win at Network
we can actually impact the core business
and so that led me to build um what we
called did commun what we called
communities and so I brought a little
bit from what first round was doing so
first round was doing these little
networks of like oh all of our product
marketing managers are going to get
together or designers and we'll do these
events and I said well I want to do
small events I'm going to have founding
members of like the top four to 10
designers data scientists infrastructure
Engineers they will be the foundation of
the community we will invite the people
that they want to invite will run the
topics that they want to run and we will
handle all the logistics for the events
and some of our employees or some of the
people in our companies may not be good
enough to attend our meetings and so I
decided to focus exclusively on the best
in the sector and not on our community
not to say that there weren't good
people from Greylock in these but like
that was not the goal so that work led
to um 17 Investments by Greylock and so
some of those were formation projects
where we were putting founding teams
together so you know an investor would
have a thesis I'd work on recruiting the
people to go and start it um and then I
also worked on IRS bringing them in to
work on new companies and then the rest
came from a lot of the community work
that that we were doing so you know two
so the our security Community one of
them started sardine which I you know
helped like invest in when I was uh at
Sweat Equity and then Dogo uh started
Anchorage the crypto company and so like
they were in our community as well and
so there must be dozens of companies
that got created that when you go to the
source of the best people in their field
they tend to have a unique insight about
what they want to build and so that's
where I really focus and so that was
kind of um the that last phase of my
career at Greylock and
um like as much as I love my time there
uh there's a pretty kind of natural
ceiling of what I was going to be able
to do frankly like I don't think they
really knew what to do with me anyways
and so like I'm not I wasn't supposed to
do these types of things and then that's
what kind of LED for me to de to kind of
move on and start something so 17
investments from basically an experiment
in communities is so cool so you're
Talent partner at
Greylock then you go start Sweat Equity
now the GP tell us about that transition
and then the unique differentiation you
guys have sure so I gave notice at the
beginning of
 
Evans was doing a phenomenal job over
there my entire team stayed like they
like left them in a really good spot
like they treated me very well they
actually accelerated my carry which is
not something you do when people quit
like they so I can't say enough good
things about what Greylock did um and
you know I really focused on making the
transition and had been thinking about
the idea for for S equity for a while I
spoke with a number of firms like great
firms with great people and they really
wanted me to just do what I had already
done at Great lock all over again and so
in my mind I'm like wait there's more
there's a lot more that we can do and
the feedback was like no what you did
before is good enough I just couldn't do
that and my wife was incredibly
supportive and said no I want you to be
happy I don't want you to just go back
into the same job and like be unhappy in
that role and in some ways it's like
even if they paid me more I'd have to
earn it like all over again and I just
wasn't like ready to do that or wanting
to do that and so we made the decision
of say like all right even if I'm going
to make dramatically less money like I
want to like do things in in my own
way and had this kind of crazy idea so
CCA 201 like 18 so this is September
there's kind of this new transition
Adventure there's this explosion of
funds like literally everyone had money
so they're announcing their fund we just
raise X millions of dollars we do
everything from seed to Public Market
investing and we're ready to do
deals and so they're all trying to
compete on something besides money
because everyone had money so what is
what is it that you can provide for me
what service and what does that look
like and so my thesis was that Venture
was never really structured to do that
so a typical fund like so say you raise
$100 million you have a fee of two to
two and a half% to operate the fund so
per 100 million you have2 to2 and A5
million dollar to operate the amount of
money that you need to deploy most of
that money goes to paying investors
operating the fund and so you have a
sliver of that left to provide some set
of servic
so to give you an idea my team at
Mozilla was about $2 million a year to
run around billions of dollars of of
deployed capital and so I was thinking
about the space and like all right how
do I change this and like I don't want
to go raise a bunch of money because
that's going to require me having an
incredibly concentrated portfolio
because I'd have to write big checks in
order to do deep enough work or to
provide something like very shallow and
so that led to the idea behind Sweat
Equity which is to essentially try to
unbundle venture services from Venture
Capital so I raised $30 million from
Reed Hoffman um that 30 million was all
operating budget and then we did work in
exchange for equity in our portfolio
companies um and so that allowed me to
spend the entire 30 million on Services
instead of 2 and a half% like per year
on services so it changed the way that I
could deliver what we were doing and so
I did not set out to you know create an
innovation inventure I kind of set out
to like do what I could do best and this
felt like the best model to do that but
what it ended up creating was taking um
what is a cost center for every other
Venture Capital firm that you're trying
to amortise over as many companies as
possible and turned it into a revenue
Center and allowed you to invest in it
very differently so I could spend $2
million on a single Company If I Was
earning enough equity for it instead of
like my entire $2 million budget that I
had at Greylock and so it allowed me to
do things that didn't scale so for
example I would create a statement of we
create to this day we still create
statements at work with our companies of
this is what we're going to deliver this
is what we're going to earn and over
what period of time and here's the
Milestones um and then it also allowed
me to create three different like I
created three service tiers so Talent
team that de did that does dedicated
recruiting work um we ended up building
an engineering team and it's a
ridiculous engineering team so it's all
kind of former tech leads and principal
engine engers um the tech lead for app
engine the tech lead for YouTube the
creator of Google Wallet
um I go on like on and on of like these
people that like were really excited
about like getting to build with early
stage companies and then we built a go
to market team that would focus on high
velocity SDR driven sales and like six s
figure Enterprise and so a lot of funds
will deliver leads but what they don't
usually tell you is what it takes to
navigate procurement in multiple like
sales site like multiple like
stakeholders and like someone wants to
buy it and you have people in the way
and like how do you actually get a 67
figure deal done so a lot of the work
would be able to kind of do that and we
were able to have a much much larger
team than any other fund could due to
the nature of our business model um I
did not announce the company for at
least the first like 18 months like I
did not want to be another fund with an
idea with
no proof behind any of it um I think
that's kind of like the immigrants child
in me of I have to to prove it like I
can't just say I'm going to do these
things and so you know it was a crazy
idea and we ended up working with like
nuro and ubiquity 6 we helped like
launch some really early stage companies
like
sardine um and uh and Scribe and it
worked like like shockingly well like
way better than I thought like I had any
right for it to work after a few years
we kind of noticed that like our
services Equity just got diluted pretty
quickly so we got mostly kind of common
shares
and that having a small amount of
capital going in would allow us to
protect our position in the company so I
went back to
read and said hey can we expand the fund
to write like 3 to 500k checks in our
CSH companies and so he agreed to that
like he's been the best partner like
anyone could ever ask for and then we
were also introduced to Howard Schultz's
family office so the Starbucks founder
and then we did another 22 million in
spvs like into our portfolio company so
service would open the door create the
opportunity and then Capital does have
scale behind it so the ability to bring
in capital to like have to like broaden
our position in the companies that that
we work with um so it worked pretty well
um do you want to keep going yeah I'm
fascinated by this story so so then talk
to us a little bit about the transition
from those learnings at Sweat Equity to
now what you're doing at the
GP well I guess you want a real story so
I'll give you the real story um so we
had two amazing LPS so we had Reed um
and and Howard Schultz though we worked
through Howard's team not Howard and you
know we thinking about like we for me to
take like the next like step um we
needed someone that kind of looks more
like folks the like the traditional LPS
like want to back so you know my mom's
from Cuba my dad's from El Salvador I'm
first generation born here I went to a
public university I do not fit the mold
of anyone that runs Venture Capital fund
and so um I had met Finn Barnes who was
at first round Capital he made an
announcement that he was you know going
to be moving on and we had gotten to
know each other I thought very like
highly of him he's like he's not your
typical VC like you know where's Nikes
he's all about his Jordan like he's a
cool he's like he's a really cool guy
and a very good investor and so part of
the initial reason was like all right if
I get someone like him I can kind of
parade him in front of the other kind of
VCS and they'll be like or the other LPS
and they they want to invest in guys
like him not not guys like me um and I
think that was a massive like disservice
to him as an investor and a partner and
so we spent a bunch of time together and
then um just built this like amazing
friendship and partnership and so we
decided to kind of Rebrand Sweat Equity
to the general partnership and then
raise our First Institutional fund so we
got re to commit um I I can't actually
legally talk about any of our LPS but
like very well-known endowments and
nonprofits like we ended up with like
truly like blue chip
um VCS but I will sell going out
fundraising in 2018 was an interesting
time so we got like 70 million right
away and then like a 100 NOS in a row
but we ended up raising 240 million
we'll raise our next fund you know
sometime soon I don't know legally what
I'm allowed to say but you know we we I
think we've earned the right to have a
second fund and so I'm being very kind
of protective of that and we built you
know it's fundamentally like Sweat
Equity 2.0 but instead of running spvs
like I don't know how much folks care
about like Finance but like the way an
SPV works is like you have to get the
allocation and then you have to get the
money and so if you can't come up with
the allocation or the money you kind of
look like a jackass and so at least in
your own funds like you're able to have
them together um and so that way like
you can make your own decisions and then
you don't have to kind of go and kind of
run an SPV um but fundamentally I don't
think we run like much different like we
run a very tight operational um ship
like service is still the core of of our
business and um Finn brings a lot of
like skill and judgment from his time in
first round and helps us look at
companies probably a little bit
differently than we had before but
fundamentally it still all comes down to
people and the quality of people that
you're working with and like giving them
the space to try and build very big
businesses Dan I have kind of maybe a
spicy one maybe not so you mentioned
your three pillars right recruiting Tech
go to market um just coming from years
and years in the chap people officer
role a lot of us are like I want to go
into Venture I want to go into Venture
and some do and real talk they've
struggled and right they don't value the
OD part of it the Strategic people Ops
right the roles that we've done in
Venture in high growth companies has
been harder to get Traction in the VCS
because it's all about recruiting
recruiting recruiting I'd love your
views on that and if that's shifting at
all or how you think about it me I can't
speak for for other firms I think at its
core or it's a different job right and
so what the role of the talent partner
in
firms maybe is making the portfolio
companies better it's more likely the
illusion of looking like you're doing a
very very good job at that your
companies are happy and VI and view that
it's important and that in the board
meeting the CEO says something about the
other about that firm and embarrasses
the other board members at other firms
and they go yell at their talent partner
of like why aren't why isn't company X
like saying good things about us and the
board meeting that's so true and so part
of like how do you create the thing that
is most referenceable and noticeable
like for Founders and a lot of that is
like a lot of the OD work is not the
CEO's work like you're working with like
you know if the HR leaders like love you
that's great but that doesn't show up in
the investment Pipeline and so if
someone is if a Founder is talking to
another founder about a
firm it's us not usually like oh they
helped me with this like organizational
design problem no it's like they solved
this like particularly important problem
for me and because of that I'm very
grateful to them or they brought me 12
Executives yeah and that's it's like
they changed the directory like
trajectory of our company and and so I
think that it's like how do you kind of
figure out the right level of
organizational impact and no one tells
you what the job is like like I said I
mean I told you how it got started at
Greylock I was like all right like make
us look good but we're not going to tell
you how go figure it out and so um I
think at the benefit of being one of the
early people in the role I had people
kind of show up and be like all right
you've been doing this like what did you
do I'm like well look I can't tell you
how your partners view the job but I can
tell you every partner has probably a
slightly different um job and there's
probably a couple partners that don't
think you should work there and I
definitely had a couple of those at
Greylock that were like why the hell is
Dan here and like what value does he
actually bring and so you need pretty
thick skin if you're going to have that
job and then you need to have a point of
view on what does it take to be
successful and I wouldn't expect the
partners to be able to kind of do that
for you it's so interesting everything
you just said I would say is exactly
what cpos face in companies some
executives are like why are you here and
we have to prove that value and have a
point of view and what that value is on
the talent partner piece I totally agree
with you Dan I always say from the
outside looking in feels like Talent
Partners have many Masters all of the
GPS in the fund who have different views
of what success looks like and then all
of the portfolio CEOs who were at
different stages of their business who
have different problems but Dan's there
so I expect Dan to do this thing for me
I feel like it's almost an impossible
task and you know obviously you did it
amazingly well at Greylock and took the
learnings and and parlay them but I I I
do caution a lot of my friends who are
like I want to get into VC I'm like are
you sure like do you what you tell
people who come to you and say like
should I get into a VC Talent partner
role um I tell them what to think about
and consider I try not tell people what
they should or should not do of like
here's the expectations around the role
I think if you do have like there's
usually at least one or two people that
are the champion for bringing that in
and as long as you have them in your
corner and like you can actually speak
to driving some success and then
deciding right is Success trying to make
everyone a little bit happy or is it
making a few people like very happy cuz
there's only trade-offs and like the
firms are always going to be too small
relative to the amount of work that they
need to do and so you have to make some
bets about what you're going to impact
and what you are going to do and what
you're not going to do and if your job
is just like oh I'm going to try and
make everyone happy with every random
request like it's just going to fail and
so um I think I had the benefit of
having you know John Lily and read and
the ability to say like all right well
here's our Strate here's my strategy
here's how I'm going to execute about it
um the other thing that I actually cage
people everything that I did at Greylock
I caged as an experiment and so I would
say I want to experiment with X I knew
exactly what I wanted to do but I wanted
to at least be able to sew like here's a
little thing here's I'm going to prove
how it works here's the data and we're
going to invest like further in that a
bit more but it allows um no one's going
to argue with an experiment but like
you're going to get into like a giant
argument if you have eight people trying
to like argue against your core Strat
in if if you even get the chance to like
present in front of partners because I
don't know how many Talent Partners
actually get to present like their
strategy in front of Partners such a
great way to get byy in it just in
general it's a great rule of thumb is
frame it as an experiment iterate it's a
great great word Dan you have a a
ton of advising gigs which is great I
think we both advise for chain link
which is fun but I get a lot of
questions I want to be an adviser like
you I want to ADV like how does thaten
happen any advice you'd give to the
group on how to get and do advising and
pitfalls to be careful of on what what
it's really like versus kind of what the
you know what what's in our heads about
the coolness Factor advising I still
work with chain link I think I can't
ever tell Sergey now I've tried to get
him to like stop paying pay him like
stop like giving us stuff like I'll just
help you and he's like no like I I
refuse to do that we like keep you on
the advisor piece because he's
phenomenal that's probably why you still
do it but the way oh yeah I mean I I
think it's a pretty impressive company
I've been working with them for three
years now like it's crazy um but I part
of it is like having one you got to
really like the people you have to like
the
problem uh it's generally not a lot
about money I guess it could work out
like a little bit but I think part of it
is do I do I get to put my expertise to
work and do I get to put it in a place
where it's incredibly like useful um
when I joined Greylock I thought I would
never do another HR product like as long
as I live and then I got introduced to
um C when they first got started
it was just like the five Founders and
they came to the office and like we had
a really good chat about what they were
doing and they had this like really good
forcing function for collecting data and
so I decided to kind of join them as an
adviser when they were first getting
started and I helped them with a lot of
their early customers um and like
working with DDA was like phenomenal um
so I guess what I would suggest is like
pick people that you actually want to
spend time with and are doing things
that you find
valuable um I think Todd Park and and
devoted Health was another one that I
really enjoyed um so I think it's it's a
way of in some Way's kind of giving back
and also it's good for your you know
reputation especially if like you're
starting out now that I run the fun I
can't really I can't I don't do I don't
do any personal advising so if there's
any advising stuff it goes directly into
the services part of the fund but yeah I
think it's it's a great it's a great way
to give back and get exposure outside of
your own like little world and like
making sure you contain it in a way that
has clear deliverables and they're not
just tricking you you into a second job
yeah and Dan if you're a Founder when do
you need an adviser yeah you don't need
an advisor you need advisors um and so I
think a lot of a lot of like I think a
lot of the work that we do is like
applied advice like we're doing advice
and execution on it with our with our
companies in that you know if you're a
Founder you usually spike in a
particular area giving in Tech it's
almost all engineering spiking like they
know he says but they you know maybe
struggle with customer Discovery or deal
navigation or all these other pieces and
so I think for people that understand
their strengths and weaknesses of having
folks that can work with them um is
incredibly important I think what we saw
is that our go to market like expertise
has been incredibly valuable to the
types of Founders that we work with of
what the hell is procurement like they
didn't even know that a thing called
procurement existed before and so now
they're having to talk to people that
are like hammering down like what with
the deal that they thought they already
struck and so just having someone work
through these things that you've never
seen before and you're not going to
really get that from your VC because a
lot of investors either have only been
an investor or they operated before
Cloud existed so like it's a different
set of like expertise of like you
know I I I wouldn't take my advice on
recruiting like I don't actively recruit
that much anymore and so you should talk
to someone that's
doing get out of here um Dan you raised
your Fund in
 
world Adventure looks a lot different
what are you expecting going into 2024
and how are you positioning the fund and
Advising Founders I think we got
lucky like it didn't feel like lucky but
it was lucky so original fund 2018 was
all services so it was pretty small uh
our First Institutional fund was a
couple years ago so that was 240 so
really got started in I guess like
 
have a bunch of like highly overvalued
companies that we going to have to do
markdowns on so that that was pretty
lucky um for us um I'm a little worried
about 2024 I think there's a lot of
things going on in the world so you have
Ukraine you have Israel we have an
election coming up it's like um so we
could get a little bit dicey so I'm just
trying to actually enjoy 2023 before I
don't want to worry about 24 until like
I get through the holidays and be like
all right the election has started now
shit's going to get weird again
so I think through Co and the last um
year or
so companies have gotten very very
efficient and raising the money that
allows them to operate for a couple
years and really focusing on revenue and
profitability and I think that that's
good because you can't just raise your
way out of problems and so I think that
that lays a very good foundation to
build some great companies I'm excited
about our portfolio and the set of
things that they're doing and they've
been battle tested in a way that most
people haven't it been 10 years since
we've had any kind of downturn so you
could be a 10 year Silicon Valley
veteran and never been through any kind
of economic issues and so I think it's a
it's a good reset and I think it's good
for people to help run better businesses
and like now just assume things are
going to be shitty and if you plan
against that then like you're going to
put yourself in a position to be
successful and then take like leave some
dry powder for hiring and or whatever
you needed so if you like the if it
looks like the opportunity is starting
to get some momentum that you can invest
kind of behind it and so I think we we
were trying to do way too many things at
once in 2021 and I think a you know much
of the industry got over their skis yep
I agree so transitioning into our rapid
fire questions I want to know who your
best hire is and
why can I do two is that okay yeah two's
two's cool think about this um you might
know a guy named Brett recard so Brett's
the partner atoa he
exceptional uh I met him I don't know
how many years ago um and so he got
started we we're a week apart like in in
age um I actually uh officiated his
wedding and he and his wife are my
daughter's like God Parents when he
graduated I guess in like 99 2000 like
all like the market like went to hell
and so his job at Anderson consulting or
Accenture basically he lost it and so he
was working for a buddy of ours at
kushman and Wakefield doing contracts
getting paid like 18 bucks an hour and
I'm like hey you're pretty smart like
you should try
recruiting um I can't hire you because
you don't have any experience but I can
get you a job at an agency like you're
going to have to like cut your teeth
like kill what you eat but like do that
for a couple years and then I'll hire
you to work for me um wherever I'm at so
placed him at the agency he did that
work and then um a couple years later I
was like all right like you've learned
it let's hire let let's bring you in and
so I brought him in I introduced him to
rep and John
Lily both said no we should not like
hire this person and I said well I want
to hire him like anyways because I think
he's going to do a really good job and
he was probably like one of the best
hires that I've ever made in in my
career and then I think a couple years
later like John came to me he's like I
will never question you on any hire ever
like you can hire whoever the hell you
want because like Brett has been like so
like phenomenal my other favorite one
was um we needed to hire Associates uh
at gy loock and so I'm like all right
I'll work with the search firm we paid
them like $90,000 like it went
absolutely nowhere I won't throw the
search firm under the bus but I'm like
all right I'm just going to do it myself
and so that's actually prob of my
favorite search because like that search
like of those people there one's a
partner at index one's a partner at
quiet um there's a bunch of people that
went through the person that we
ultimately ended up identifying was a
guy named s to medy um who was you know
just out of Stanford pm at relate
IQ he wanted to start like a a startup
I'd stayed close to him like a year
later he's like all right well this
business is doing okay but it's never
going to be a huge business I'd like to
like rethink moving ADV Venture so we
ended up hiring him as an associate like
he's now kind of air parent to like run
Greylock like he's kind of on the
management committee I don't even know
if he's 30 years old yet but I think uh
I have I have a good nose for for a
talent like pretty early in their career
so uh whatever credit I could take for
their Career Success I'm happy I'm happy
to do is there a secret there that like
for the Undiscovered Talent of like how
you're finding these people and what
tips what tips it to you is there a
secret um I think it's twofold I don't
this actually a good question that I
thought about discussing with you guys
I'm not big on structured interviews um
a lot of my Approach on on what I do is
I really go deep into people's work
history of like what they did why they
did it the decisions they made why they
mattered the impact they had in the role
and then I validate all those things so
I'll go and do references because like
my worst set of people to interview are
Consultants like McKenzie and Bane
because they're all taught to do
presentations and so you can't really
tell who's good and who's not and so a
lot of the work of getting through
and understanding what people have done
what they think that they're capable all
doing and where they want to go and then
validating that they were they're good
so in s's case like like I reached out
to GJ Patel who was running product at
the time and he's like s is too good to
work in Venture he should start a
company and so I'm like all right like
like that was a good reference to like
figure out that he's someone that we
should spend time on and now DJ's
inventure so um so I think a lot of is
like trying
to understand you know is a person good
and um yeah my experience kind of like I
think a lot of like past experience
indicates like future experience and I a
lot of the people that we ended up
hiring at the GP a lot of first
generation like college students a lot
of um first generation people in the US
and it's funny it's not um by design
that we look for that it was kind of
after the fact and we were having like a
lunch or dinner that those things came
out and then there's a certain level of
kind of grit and desire that kind of try
to look for and find in people of like
is this person unwilling
to uh not be successful so like they
just they're not going to be stopped and
so trying to find that whenever possible
they have some some sort of Chip like
something about them that's like I just
yeah little bit broken but Sala dancing
lessons they got be a little bit broken
Dan I did want to sneak in one more
question uh to your point on past
experience you know predicting future
Etc is the power of back channels um and
leveraging those or not or if so how and
how you've done that in your career
especially with executive hiring fairly
quick to get most people a lot of times
I can do it with like a text message of
do you know this person how well do you
know them are they good and so uh
references are probably the most
important part of it I
think interviews are the best that we
have but they're a pretty poor indicator
of whether or not like someone's going
to be successful I think there's a
percentage of people that are going to
suck no matter what there's a percentage
of people that'll be successful no
matter what and then the vast majority
of um people it's like situational and
so I think that's part of why I like um
doing a lot of history of like why
people like you know what people like
because it helps me to fit like what
size hole do they fit in an organization
and what are how do I put them in the
place that's going to make them be where
they can actually be most successful and
I think that that that's kind of led a
lot of like the back Channel help so I
think part of that is really kind of
understanding things that people maybe
don't understand themselves and so I've
had folks come to me like years later
and be like our interview was really
helpful and I'm like I don't even
remember that conversation and I think
part of that's because I've had I don't
how many thousands of them like over the
years but you know if you can find like
what people like actually makes them
tick like you can put them in the right
job and I think that's one of the really
great parts of of being like a venture
partner in Talent which is if you
fundamentally know your companies and
you know what motivates people and you
know what they're good at you have an
opportunity to put them in like the best
jobs that they're ever going to have and
there's a lot of reward a lot of reward
that and that's probably like the best
part of doing this job and every job
that I've had of like when someone comes
back and they're like that is the best
job that I've ever had like thank you
yeah I couldn't agree more on the back
channels I mean I I used to get maybe
one two texts a week right and the text
would be are they good and my answer
would be well it depends what are you
hiring them for and and where uh so I
yeah they can be dangerous they can be
super helpful the learning I think for
the audience though is that especially
in Tech the world is so much smaller
than you actually think and the longer
that you're in the world the more people
know you and it's just it's usually just
like you know it's what is it s degrees
of from Kevin Bacon it's like more like
seven degrees from like Dan Portillo cuz
like like people are going to be able to
figure out very quickly who you worked
with and hit them up and so that's where
reputation I think really matters and
regardless I was talking to a friend the
other night who's a little frustrated in
her current role and I was like whatever
happens like you must leave on good
terms and and you must end that thing as
professionally as possible and that's
one of the things I look at earlier in
my career uh that I regret that I wish I
would have done better and it's that
people people are connected super small
but there's one thing actually hopefully
it's helpful to your audience of as I as
I think about like my career and some of
the lessons of like early in your career
everyone that you talk to is more
valuable to you than you are to them and
that at some point like that will flip
when you build enough expertise or
knowledge and being aware of like when
that flips of like how do you then start
to give like back to people in it and
you know there's there's also kind of
this growth in in working as a you know
in Talent OR Talent partner that the
beginning is like you get good at
sourcing and then you get good at
running process and then you know maybe
you get uh good at closing people or you
run a big Talent team of the people that
I've found that like work at like a
truly like expert level are more than
just like closing wrecks like you're not
just like oh here's this job I found the
person I closed it but you're actually
filling holes like inside of companies
and so part of that is like
understanding like well what are we
trying to accomplish like with this job
or this piece that we want to hire and
that when we place a position does it
actually cover two holes that we have
not just one and so how does that kind
of factor in and where you kind of move
from filling jobs in a company to
actually company building and that's a
very different skill set um that takes a
long time to get to and I think that
that's kind of the big shift of when you
you've gotten to that really like top
level in your career that you're able to
kind of affect organization like
organizational level problems not
requisition problems that's the top of
the food chain of Designing
teams and ultimately what I think
Founders really want when they're hiring
a chief people officer or head of
recruiting is somebody who's not just
like let me just put a butt in the seat
it's somebody who's thinking
holistically not just about the skills
required but the interpersonal skills
and how that person interacts and
ultimately that's going to be the the
team that builds the company or that
kills the company Dan uh thank you so
much for coming on the show you've
always been a mentor to me every time we
talk I learn so much and I really
appreciate the time yeah thanks so much
Dan oh thank you thank you for having me

amazing at what you do and so I'm just
grateful I get to chat so thank you
