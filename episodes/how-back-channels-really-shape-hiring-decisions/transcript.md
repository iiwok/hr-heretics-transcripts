what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today
we're going to do a segment on back
channels so Kelly we've talked about
back channels a couple of times during
episodes but we've never given them its
own time and I want to do that today so
let's start with
what is a back
Channel yeah it's a I'm glad we're doing
this the the back you know the back
channel it's kind of like this um behind
the scenes I call it like the
underground like Mafia of getting
feedback on people you know I kind of I
kind of call you we have the above the
table process
references the whole thing that everyone
knows about and then there's the real
deal where it's I call it the under the
table process where
people basically call their friends or
people they know well and say hey G give
me the real deal on Nolan you know uh
and so I call it like the the real talk
which is helpful and it's also has some
some big flaws with it and so I'm glad
we're talking about it today I agree um
the way I frame a back channel is a
reference on a candidate that the
candidate didn't give us so the reason
why people do back channels is
because it turns out that the interview
process is imperfect we've talked about
this a million times on the show um we
are trying to get signal on candidates
candidates as part of the reference
process will obviously give you people
that will speak very highly of them and
oftentimes in the reference process it's
almost impossible to get constructive
feedback on a candidate and so given
that we are left with few other options
what we tend to do is we pick up the
phone
and you know we call people from other
companies that we know to get feedback
on that person the thing I want to talk
about is is the how I actually think
most companies do back channeling wrong
and there is a right way to do it so one
of the things that I tell candidates as
they're in an interview process is that
we will do back channels I will explain
what that is I will explain why we do it
and then I will give the candidate the
opportunity to tell me if there are any
red flags whether that be you know
they're worried about talking to a
current manager or the current employer
doesn't know that they're interviewing
or somebody's going to talk really
negatively about them that always comes
up and I find that if you just take that
one easy step and tell the candidate
what you're going to do it doesn't
surprise the candidate they are able to
actually help you figure out how to
navigate this complex process and it
puts everything above board as you said
you know to to lead off the show it's
kind of like this underground thing I
think that's actually one of the ways
that you can make it above ground yeah
and I think I think it's it's
increasingly become above ground I think
especially if you're a senior leader if
if you don't know this is a thing I
think that that that is a red flag in
itself I mean this is just kind of
normal way of business now and to your
point I think the maturity around it is
the biggest
problem you know what I mean because the
person that's that's asking for the back
Channel as well as the person that's
giving the back Channel we have to go
beyond hey are they good or not should I
hire them or not it's like look this
person was you know I worked with them
 
everyone has challenges or development
areas I just think the the maturity upon
which we enter these
conversations is is the fulcrum for me
of whether they can be actually really
helpful and advantageous even after you
hire someone based on what you ask and
the information you get or actually
really dangerous and fraught with bias
and fraught with like you know just
things that happened a long time ago or
whatnot and does not account for how
that person has grown over the
years you hit on two really yeah you hit
on two really important things there
which is like how do you actually do
them and how do we think about signal
that is not positive and then the second
piece is is like when do you do them so
I want to start with when because I
think this is this is where things get
really delicate so I once worked with
the CEO who literally once a candidate
was introduced from an executive
recruiter would immediately start back
channeling the candidate no and this is
going back to like how we do it but
there was no awareness given to the
candidate um you know the CEO is just
trying to get signal to figure out like
okay what should I know about this
person where should I focus it was uh in
good conscience to try and figure things
out but but one of those back channels
got back to the candidate before the CEO
had the initial call and the candidate
was like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this like why
would I want to talk to you now like
what a weird thing for you to do so
let's talk about when um when you think
back channeling is appropriate what's
your take on that
Kelly yeah look I mean I I I think it
depends I always think it depends um
early on in the process look I call the
back channeling frenzy we want to avoid
what he just said which is this Feeding
Frenzy of like let's start back
channeling everyone we have top of
funnel right when they enter the process
like absolutely not right like and so I
I I always call it like qu quality over
the quantity of this stuff is really
important because I've seen like 20
candidates top of funnel and this
executive recruiter is back channeling
all of them and there's all this noise
in the market and it just gets very
confusing very quickly and it's hard to
actually determine you know what's
what's what's quality and what's noise
in the system so I I do I do actually
like to say like mid late stage in the
process if you have three or four final
candidates hopefully it's you know one
to three I think that's the right time
to be like listen we are really serious
about these people we want to know the
good the bad all of it because we're
probably going to hire them they are
viable candidates and we're going to
actually you know assess them through
the process and not let potentially
biased frenzy back channels influence
whether or not we move them forward in
our process so I think it's can be very
dangerous to do that upfront because you
might you know rule someone out when
they should actually go through the
process and they might be a great
candidate for your company what do you
think it's so well said I I I strongly
agree um I think doing it at the
beginning of the process will color your
judgment on somebody before you ready to
have Nuance in the Judgment so I
actually like to think of it a little
bit like dating um people hate this
analogy but it's like look like why
don't you just like get to know somebody
like go to coffee a few times grab a
movie like before you start talking to
their friends and start like you know
meeting family members right away it's
just like we don't need to get to that
level of depth like there is a process
to do things so I think that's the right
way to do it um you know the thing I
would say is like
somewhere in the middle of the process
after you have met the candidate you're
building a relationship to tell them
that this is part of your process I
think is the right step and that's what
I think people don't do um and that's
what I think is like if you could just
present it there and then once you start
having conversations then you could
actually have increasingly more back
channels to then go and vet what you
hear in those conversations I think
that's the right time hey everyone we'll

Heretics here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about
about 80% don't typically work in an
office so it's no surprise that
digitally engaging employees is the
number one concern for CEOs as companies
go hybrid but as hybrid is quickly
becoming the norm it's easy for
workplaces to start feeling a little
less human yet delighting a digital
Workforce is possible and it can even be
dare we say fun that's where work Vivo
zoom's employee experience platform
comes in if you've ever recoiled at the
thought of a static internet that looks
like something you built in 1995 using
Ms paint have no fear work Vivo is a
dynamic intuitive accessible and mobile

work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics sent
you
 
yeah yeah I think I think you when you
mentioned color your judgment I think
that was a perfect way to sum that up um
and we we talk about bias in the hiring
process you know in all different facets
this one if you're not careful is just
like totally fraught with bias in my
opinion and a lot of it is how you tee
something up too right like the back
channels I get are usually let's be
honest texts or calls hey what do you
think of Sally should I hire her that's
the wrong question like talk to someone
tell them first what you think think for
yourself hey we've been talking to Sally
for three months she's at the end of our
process here's what we saw and feel and
think would be great for our company
here are some areas where she might need
some help based on what we've seen like
what is your assessment you worked with
her six years ago maybe five years years
ago I know she might be a different
human now tell me reconcile that for me
not to say should I hire her or not but
if we did in this situation here's our
culture here's the job here's what it's
going to take here's our assessment what
do you think and then most importantly
treat it as a data point it is not a
decision like if if I call you no one
and I want to hire someone who you
worked with six years ago and I'm like
oh no one said not to hire them I'm not
going to hire them that's insane and I
think that happens more than we think
and so again I'm going to go back to
that maturity of how you ask the
question how you Tee It Up to the person
you're asking the back Channel about as
well as the people you're asking about
the candidate right it's both those
people hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform the recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metaview
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
por and check out medavie head over to
metav view. a/h Heretics to talk to one
of metav View's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled
 
admes I think that's actually the most
prevalent way it happen happens so so
just for the audience if you're not used
to this process the way it usually
happens is for me I will get a text or
an email that says hey what do you think
about insert candidate name we're
interviewing them for a role
and uh usually you know everyone's busy
and I've been guilty of this especially
in the past I'm I'm much better at it
today because I know like I'm on the
other side of this too and people are
doing this to me um almost always now I
will pick up the phone six or seven
years ago when I was more immature I
would just send a note and be like yep
good and then if it was negative I would
say let's jump on a call and totally
totally that's typically what happens I
I actually a lot of people will a lot of
people will take that on a lot of people
will say like people will call me and
say oh my God someone just texted me
about this person what should I do like
they don't want to they don't want to
engage in that and a lot of people if
they get a text back let's talk they'll
just rule the candidate out and again
you're you're missing every part of the
context of the damn company the job the
culture like what they're trying to do
and you're just going back to how you
worked with that person six years ago
and it's it's it's just not it's not
right again to the bias point so you you
gave a hypothet I will give a very real
back Channel no that wasn't hypothetical
just happened okay I had one that just
happened four weeks ago so great
um a friend reached out saying hey I
know you worked with this person who was
an exec at a company that I was with um
and he's like you know what was your
take and so we jumped on a call and I
was like look this is a Nuance situation
um they were in a tough role at a tough
time working on like a zero to one
product It ultimately didn't work here's
my Nuance on it number one I love this
person as a person I think they're a
phenomenal leader like I saw
followership um always really positive
interactions But ultimately for many
different reasons again one person's
opinion it didn't work out with the
product and so um I gave that feedback
six weeks later four or five four or
five six weeks on his Zone I get a text
from the person who reached out saying
hey thanks so much for the feedback we
spent more time we did more digging and
we actually decided to make an offer um
which I loved I'll tell one more story
so I I did a back Channel um when I was
at door dash on a recruiting leader that
I wanted to hire and I reached out to
somebody who gave literally the best
analogy I've ever heard about this and I
was asking like why the candidate didn't
progress faster in their career at the
current company and the the leader said
look Nolan have you ever been to a a
family reunion to where you know you go
and see your uncle and your uncle's like
oh look it's little Nolan yeah and
you're like dude I'm a grown ass man
like quit calling me little Nolan well
it turns out like that's a bias in
humans we have that first impression in
mind and so often times when you're
doing a back Channel you're talking to
someone that can only think about that
person in that context of when they
first met them and they don't apply
human growth yes and so when I heard
that it it actually completely changed
the way that I thought about all sorts
of feedback and all sorts of
interactions because everybody grows
everybody changes yeah and I find that
the biggest recruiting bias is is that
we don't apply that we don't give people
that opportunity to grow and to learn
and I think that's where back channels
really go wrong it's it's yeah it's the
opposite of recency bias you know what I
mean it's it's like human nature like my
brother is 43 years old he's still five
to me I mean it's just how it work and
you have to fight that and so I think
those stories make sense and you know 10
years ago used to text back I used to do
do the wrong things at times and I think
that's my biggest ask is you know to the
earthquake analogy like stop drop and
roll like get on a conversation apply
context talk about the nuances ask
questions what are you asking this
person to do what's your company like
what's the plan the next two years like
there's there's always the the landscape
of which this person sits in coupled
with their growth and how they've
changed and there's no way you you can
cover that in a text it's not fair to
the candidate it's not fair to the
company potentially hiring them and it's
not a thorough process and and that's
ultimately like what we're trying to do
you I want to talk about when you get
Negative back channel so I just told
that story um you know there's there's a
lot of examples and and Kelly let's just
talk about us right like yeah in our
careers it's super clear now that if you
go deep enough you are going to find
people that do not like us and that is
that is just going to happen as you get
more senior in your career you're going
to have people who don't have 100%
positive things to say about you and
that's like humans right that's what
happens like we don't we're not
perfect that is where the meat is like
that is the best opportunity to actually
go deep and figure out what is actually
going on here so when I get a negative
back Channel what I like to do is go as
deep as possible about what happened why
happened what that person's version of
events were then if I can keep their
anonymity and I actually usually ask
them in the conversation hey can I bring
this up to this person and ask them
specifically what happened in the
situation then you take that information
and you go to the
candidate and you ask the candidate hey
I heard this as part of our process can
you give me your thoughts and
Reflections on this and the best people
have
self-reflection they will admit when
things didn't go well they will admit
that maybe they didn't handle things
great totally and for me that's what I'm
looking for in a process I'm not looking
for Perfection I'm looking for growth
yeah I mean the irony is the reason that
that person might not be getting great
feedback might be a great reason to hire
them like that's the that's the irony of
the context around this is those things
might actually positive stories and if I
hear great things about someone and
there's no there's no turbulence that
that's a red flag to me and we had a
candidate at a recent company I was
hiring for um a sea Suite candidate and
that happened and we asked the person I
said listen here are some themes what's
the deal and that's actually a great
litmus test of the kind of person you
want to hire to see how they react in
that situation so again it's back to the
maturity though a lot of people will
just shotgun boom I heard this what is
this and they go back Channel and
everyone's spinning around and the
frenzy starts and that's just not
productive so again it's all about the
maturity of the house you engage in this
and there's a lot of folks you know that
are running around with scissors with
this stuff or they shouldn't be you know
you know who I think is the most
immature on this I might take some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
for this
comment is the board of
directors I find that the board most
boards that I've interacted with are
incredibly shallow on Talent
topics and they'll reach out to one of
their friends yeah who has like one
negative thing to say and it's like well
I got a I got a negative back channel
from so and so and then you know when
you start to do actually like the Nuance
thing the board doesn't the board member
typically won't engage in that topic
have you had that experience Kelly of
course of course and I I will go on to
say that's that's the
cycle that's killing us and nothing
against boards I love all the board
members I've worked with love the
Venture Capital people I I work with
them still but let's be honest it's
changing now but for the last 20 30
years those people they're all very
similar right back to bias back to diver
it's very homo homogeneous as far as
those folks and they think alike and
they might give thumbs up or thumbs down
the same criteria and it's kind of like
that it's it's it's again it's fraught
with bias and I just again maturity
context the situation it all matters the
worst part for me is the death like it's
it's one thing to have you know to say
something negative about somebody like
you're allowed to have that opinion but
you're not allowed to have that opinion
and not be able to go to the lowest
level of detail of why you feel that way
I think and that's I've experienced a
lot of that unfortunately in my the
higher you go the more of that
unfortunately exists yeah and let's
let's just name the shallowness it's
it's in my experience it's usually is
this person liked or not like it's like
again it's back to like I always joke
about Middle School Tech and middle
school there's a lot of similarities and
my kids are in eth grade so I see it but
that's usually what both go down to like
do I have do I kind of like this person
are they in should you work with them
and and again I think it's it's just so
much more complex than that yep I'm with
you well look everybody please keep
sending us these topics like this is
actually one that came from the audience
recently so send us your topics send us
