Hey everybody, how are you doing? Nolan
and I are back here for another uh Dear
Heretics. Nolan, some people want some
advice on some stuff.
&gt;&gt; We're back, baby.
&gt;&gt; We're back. Um, all right. So, this one
came in. It's it's a great one. And by
the way, keep them coming everybody. I
mean, LinkedIn, message us, text us, um,
send us your, you know,
&gt;&gt; your your your darkest thoughts and
questions and and needs. Hate mail is
fine. Send to Nolan, not me. But these
are great. So, keep them coming. I think
we have like four in the queue. So, this
one's about bonus programs. This
question came in and this person says,
"Hey, I'd love for you both to talk
about, you know, what you've seen, what
you think, what's happening with bonus
programs right now. We don't have a
bonus program at our company. We're
thinking about doing it. The group's
kind of split. What's going on out
there? Give me Give me some fodder on
this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It feels like every like three to
four years there's like this like
rotation back in and everyone's like we
need to have an incentive bonus program.
So, I feel like we're right squarely
like as that wave is peaking again.
Here's my general take. I've built
these. I think obviously for sales it's
obvious like you have to have this not
from day zero but like once you
understand the ICP and the motion it's
very well understood like what the
metrics need to look like and then
working backwards from those to build a
compelling incentive plan for your
sellers. That's obvious. This question
Kelly is more around like what about
everybody else and how should we think
about it? So the high level the way I've
thought about this is like what stage is
the company and I find for early and
mid-stage companies it is incredibly
challenging to build one of these
programs because the goalposts are
always moving and when you design one of
these programs typically you are
anchoring in like I want you to move
these metrics in this way and you know
as the old saying goes incentives drive
behavior. behavior. And so I find that
bonus programs, the early and mid-stage
companies are very challenging to
implement and then maintain because [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
is just changing all the time and it
becomes like, oh, we want to pivot or we
want to go run an experiment. Well, the
next question then you have to ask is
like, well, how does this fit in with
our bonus program? And are people going
to feel compelled to do the thing that
we want them to do? So that's thing one.
Thing two is like look bonuses do drive
behavior. It is just objectively true. I
also think like we could solve this
problem just by paying people really
well to begin with and then having a
very high performance culture and such
that like we don't need to like you know
coin operate every additional thing that
this person does which it does feel a
little bit transactional to me. It's
like the worst of human dynamics of
like, okay, great. Nolan, I would like
you to source 50 more profiles a week
and I will give you $500 to do it. I'm
like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll do it, but am I going
to do it because it's the right
motivators? Like, probably not. So,
that's my overarching take, Kelly.
What's your take?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it is complicated, man. Like,
I just talked about this with a company
I was working with actually. Um, so I
got a I got a Radford report, right,
with the short-term incentive report.
And it's pretty crazy that like 92% or
 
Even like early stage, right? Kind of it
it gave the, you know, the distribution
series A through E and public companies.
I feel like a lot of companies, Nolan,
like it's a legacy thing. Do you know
what I mean? Like everyone has one. So,
we have to have one because what happens
in the recruiting process is the OT,
right? The ontarget earnings, they're
just not equal. So, all these candidates
are like, well, my base is 200K plus a
 
trying to get them, doesn't have a
bonus. So, they're like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do we do
a sign on bonus? Do we do higher
guaranteed comp? Like it's this vicious
cycle where folks are kind of stuck
right now on this. And
I get why. And the other thing I think
about bonus programs, I said once that
toothpaste is out of the tube, you can't
put it back. Like you got to think about
this because once it sounds so easy,
yeah, let's do a bonus program. You're
stuck. You try to get rid of that. It's
very difficult. And the irony is you're
completely right. like at these series B
even C companies that are moving so fast
and things are so dynamic it turns into
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show like every year because it's
almost impossible to accurately forecast
whether it's churn whether it's revenue
whether it's Mau Dow whatever it is and
then you're you're always in this
position of like well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we didn't hit
it but
&gt;&gt; it was out of it was out of their
control like you know it was so far off
or we're so far over the cat. It's like
we're now we're at 200% of payout. Like
it's just insane. So, I actually don't
like them for those reasons. If you can
get away with not doing it, you guys, I
wouldn't I wouldn't do it. I would try
other aspects. And I don't know about
you, but as an executive, I told some I
told someone this a couple years ago.
I'm like, I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about a
bonus. 20 30 40% like the equity is why
I'm there. to your point, I'm not going
to like work harder because of the 30%
bonus. I don't think in my mind that it
actually intrinsically motivates people
as much as people think. The last thing
I'll say is a lot of these companies put
them into place and it's at a certain
level or like certain teams have them
and other teams don't. That is insane to
me. either don't do it or do it
consistently where it's paid out in a
way where the company is rowing together
in a consistent manner. I mean this all
over the place, some teams having it,
some don't, some levels, some not. I
don't understand that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um and that can cause a lot of strife.
&gt;&gt; Now, you do agree that all sellers
should have a bonus. Yeah. Like that's
there's no argument there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not talking about commission
plans. I'm talking about Yeah. a
variable component.
on top of the salary.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the putting it the toothpaste back
in the tube comment just to talk about
this. So, like walking these back is
brutal and I've done it. And by the way,
this bonus, it was like a Christmas
bonus at one of the companies that I
worked at and it was based off of how
the company was performing. But like
people anchor to like I'm getting this
&gt;&gt; totally.
&gt;&gt; And so one year the company didn't hit
and they still gave it. Then I joined
and I was like what is this dissonance?
Like are we doing this or not? And then
of course the CFO always is like the
first person pushing for the bonus
program and the first p person pushing
to eliminate the bonus program. It's
like the boat owner, right? The first
day you buy it is your best day and the
day you sell it is your best day. the
CFO is that same person. And so like we
end up walking this back and there was
like riots in the streets and people are
like what the hell is going on here?
Like this is supposed to be part of my
compensation plan. And obviously like
you know we had bumped up salaries and
those but people don't think that way
and it's very very challenging like with
any benefit that you roll out at the
company walking it back it's like you
know it's why we don't do any social
security uh changes in government. It's
like once they have it, you can't take
it away. So that is exactly true.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. Metav is the
AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metave suite of AI agents works for you
at every stage of the hiring process.
Their platform powers instant job postc
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metav changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to

&gt;&gt; We talk a lot in tech about technical
debt, right? We talk a lot about the
codebase and tech debt and it's like,
you know, this is how like engineering
leaders, you know, once every five
sentences tech debt is mentioned as a
legitimate constraint as to why they
can't move faster. We never talk about
people debt. It is like never discussed
at all. It's like, well, you just like
do the thing and then like this is this
is exhibit A of how people debt
accumulates. So, you know, hairbrain
executive was brushing his teeth this
morning and decides like we should have
a bonus program because it's really
going to motivate people, right? We sit
down at the exec meeting. You know,
people like me, you and Kelly are all
like, "Okay, here's the second order of
this. like what happens if we ch and and
you know this is where we get the
naysayer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right to where they're
like oh like of it's always the can't do
team you know there they go again and
it's like no we're just trying to help
you like we can roll it out but we're
just helping you think through second
order consequences here then we roll it
out and then the company pivots or the
product dramatically changes or a new
competitor enters the space and
everything that we had built these
assumptions off of is now decimated.
So, not only can we now not focus on the
core thing, which is how do we solve
this new problem, we have to like
actually think about this other
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this debt that has now
accumulated that we have to go make an
interest payment on before we can solve
the real principal problem. That's the
thing that I don't think people really
understand. But it's so hard to
articulate that to executive team.
&gt;&gt; I know it's one of those things we're
like, I get it. I get it. Brushing the
teeth. Hey, we should do a bonus
program. And
&gt;&gt; totally
&gt;&gt; and then we hear that and literally like
a flash of light. It's like you can see
your life like in a flash in your mind.
I can think through all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all
the scenarios, all the stuff in like 3
seconds in my head. Like how do I
explain this? And the best way I can
explain it is to your point is not to
say no, but it's like listen before we
do this, it's like before you get
married to someone, make sure that you
think through because once that
toothpaste is out, it is hell on earth
to put it back in. And and frankly, it's
kind of hellish to even implement a
bonus program because it's usually
fraught with, well, now you're not going
to get a merit increase. Your raise is
this variable component.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. that may you may or may not
get. It's a whole thing. And I really
believe this. I don't care how much, you
know, how many metrics and hard numbers
you tie to this for people in their
mind. To your point, they already have
calculated it. They've already bought a
car because this is coming.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then you're screwed because if you
don't think through it, you don't have
metrics, right? You and I have been at
companies. Well, we'll just do MBOs, you
know, judgment.
That's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you're basically
giving it to them. It doesn't exist that
managers actually apply judgment without
numbers and say, "Well, you're going to
get 70%, you're going to get
&gt;&gt; that's a fable and it's hard anyway
because it is judgment based MBOs and
then you get all sorts of other stuff.
People get unhappy, right? Well, I was
discriminated against. You didn't give
me." It's just it's chaos. I talked
about this at Pendo a while back. Like I
love a good short sprint incentive. If I
was a CEO, I'd put money away. Let's
just say you model it out. Everyone in
the company has what? 15%
average bonus. Put that in a huge
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bucket. Decide whether you want
to use it or not to incentivize certain
teams on sprints. Just, you know what I
mean?
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like engineer it and product and
design. You better work together
functionally and productively to ship
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the next six weeks. If you
do, you all get this
&gt;&gt; marketing idea. We have to Yeah, we have
to nail these conferences. We have to
like Supio's marketing team is just all
over the place. Conferences on the road,
weekends, like
&gt;&gt; you guys nail this boom sprint, but you
got to work well with sales. You got to
bring in the MQLs and the deals. Like I
love that because you can be flexible
and creative and not tie to a bunch of
crap that's going to change anyway.
&gt;&gt; Kelly, that's an awesome. So the spiff I
totally agree with you like a short-term
spiff is like a powerful lever. The
other one by the way in addition to that
is not just like the kind of carrot
dangled. The other one is the surprise
and delight. So, like, do you know
Google had spot bonuses and actually my
wife is still at Google and she just did
this with her team and I like forgot
about spot bonuses and she goes, "Hey, I
just asked for like a pretty big chunk
because we killed it last year or last
quarter, whatever it was." And there's
like, you know, a handful of people who
were working nonstop like during one of
these big problem moments and, you know,
you deliver a couple grand to somebody,
you know, it has to matter, right? So
like the amount matter to your point,
you have to have like a legit rainy day
fund to go deploy it in the right way.
But there's nothing like saying like,
"Hey, thank you for doing what you're
doing. Thank you for always prioritizing
the company and making it happen. by the
way, I went to bat for you and like I
got this like 10 grand. Like the amount
of loyalty that that buys you like and
the amount of problems that that person
will no longer bring to your table
anymore because they're like, "Dude,
like my boss had my back." That's
another great lever to pull.
&gt;&gt; It's incredible. And that matters more
than the dollar amount. Like I just gave
one last week. I've been at CPO for like
five weeks and these poor people I'm
like, you know, I'm like, "Listen, I
know it's been intense. I know I've been
leaning on you a lot because we have
some gaps, you know, in the organ. Thank
you. Like go do something this weekend.
Go away. Go do like or do nothing,
whatever. Like just I see you. I
appreciate it.
&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt; it's fantastic. So
&gt;&gt; yeah, these huge lumbering bonus
programs that connect to everyone in
this really presumptuous way where
everyone's equal, even like lemons on
the team, high performers. Like do
yourself a favor and budget it and use
it as your discretion and be able to be
agile on it.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Avoid people debt.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks everyone. See you
later.
&gt;&gt; Peace.
