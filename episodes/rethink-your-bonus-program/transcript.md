are great. So, keep them coming. I think
 
are great. So, keep them coming. I think
we have like four in the queue. So, this
 
we have like four in the queue. So, this
one's about bonus programs. This
 
one's about bonus programs. This
question came in and this person says,
 
question came in and this person says,
"Hey, I'd love for you both to talk
 
"Hey, I'd love for you both to talk
about, you know, what you've seen, what
 
about, you know, what you've seen, what
you think, what's happening with bonus
 
you think, what's happening with bonus
programs right now. We don't have a
 
programs right now. We don't have a
bonus program at our company. We're
 
bonus program at our company. We're
thinking about doing it. The group's
 
thinking about doing it. The group's
kind of split. What's going on out
 
kind of split. What's going on out
there? Give me Give me some fodder on
 
there? Give me Give me some fodder on
this.
 
this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It feels like every like three to
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It feels like every like three to
four years there's like this like
 
four years there's like this like
rotation back in and everyone's like we
 
rotation back in and everyone's like we
need to have an incentive bonus program.
 
need to have an incentive bonus program.
So, I feel like we're right squarely
 
So, I feel like we're right squarely
like as that wave is peaking again.
 
like as that wave is peaking again.
Here's my general take. I've built
 
Here's my general take. I've built
these. I think obviously for sales it's
 
these. I think obviously for sales it's
obvious like you have to have this not
 
obvious like you have to have this not
from day zero but like once you
 
from day zero but like once you
understand the ICP and the motion it's
 
understand the ICP and the motion it's
very well understood like what the
 
very well understood like what the
metrics need to look like and then
 
metrics need to look like and then
working backwards from those to build a
 
working backwards from those to build a
compelling incentive plan for your
 
compelling incentive plan for your
sellers. That's obvious. This question
 
sellers. That's obvious. This question
Kelly is more around like what about
 
Kelly is more around like what about
everybody else and how should we think
 
everybody else and how should we think
about it? So the high level the way I've
 
about it? So the high level the way I've
thought about this is like what stage is
 
thought about this is like what stage is
the company and I find for early and
 
the company and I find for early and
mid-stage companies it is incredibly
 
mid-stage companies it is incredibly
challenging to build one of these
 
challenging to build one of these
programs because the goalposts are
 
programs because the goalposts are
always moving and when you design one of
 
always moving and when you design one of
these programs typically you are
 
these programs typically you are
anchoring in like I want you to move
 
anchoring in like I want you to move
these metrics in this way and you know
 
these metrics in this way and you know
as the old saying goes incentives drive
 
as the old saying goes incentives drive
behavior. behavior. And so I find that
 
behavior. behavior. And so I find that
bonus programs, the early and mid-stage
 
bonus programs, the early and mid-stage
companies are very challenging to
 
companies are very challenging to
implement and then maintain because [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
implement and then maintain because [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
is just changing all the time and it
 
is just changing all the time and it
becomes like, oh, we want to pivot or we
 
becomes like, oh, we want to pivot or we
want to go run an experiment. Well, the
 
want to go run an experiment. Well, the
next question then you have to ask is
 
next question then you have to ask is
like, well, how does this fit in with
 
like, well, how does this fit in with
our bonus program? And are people going
 
our bonus program? And are people going
to feel compelled to do the thing that
 
to feel compelled to do the thing that
we want them to do? So that's thing one.
 
we want them to do? So that's thing one.
Thing two is like look bonuses do drive
 
Thing two is like look bonuses do drive
behavior. It is just objectively true. I
 
behavior. It is just objectively true. I
also think like we could solve this
 
also think like we could solve this
problem just by paying people really
 
problem just by paying people really
well to begin with and then having a
 
well to begin with and then having a
very high performance culture and such
 
very high performance culture and such
that like we don't need to like you know
 
that like we don't need to like you know
coin operate every additional thing that
 
coin operate every additional thing that
this person does which it does feel a
 
this person does which it does feel a
little bit transactional to me. It's
 
little bit transactional to me. It's
like the worst of human dynamics of
 
like the worst of human dynamics of
like, okay, great. Nolan, I would like
 
like, okay, great. Nolan, I would like
you to source 50 more profiles a week
 
you to source 50 more profiles a week
and I will give you $500 to do it. I'm
 
and I will give you $500 to do it. I'm
like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll do it, but am I going
 
like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll do it, but am I going
to do it because it's the right
 
to do it because it's the right
motivators? Like, probably not. So,
 
motivators? Like, probably not. So,
that's my overarching take, Kelly.
 
that's my overarching take, Kelly.
What's your take?
 
What's your take?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it is complicated, man. Like,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it is complicated, man. Like,
I just talked about this with a company
 
I just talked about this with a company
I was working with actually. Um, so I
 
I was working with actually. Um, so I
got a I got a Radford report, right,
 
got a I got a Radford report, right,
with the short-term incentive report.
 
with the short-term incentive report.
And it's pretty crazy that like 92% or
 
And it's pretty crazy that like 92% or
 
Even like early stage, right? Kind of it
 
Even like early stage, right? Kind of it
it gave the, you know, the distribution
 
it gave the, you know, the distribution
series A through E and public companies.
 
series A through E and public companies.
I feel like a lot of companies, Nolan,
 
I feel like a lot of companies, Nolan,
like it's a legacy thing. Do you know
 
like it's a legacy thing. Do you know
what I mean? Like everyone has one. So,
 
what I mean? Like everyone has one. So,
we have to have one because what happens
 
we have to have one because what happens
in the recruiting process is the OT,
 
in the recruiting process is the OT,
right? The ontarget earnings, they're
 
right? The ontarget earnings, they're
just not equal. So, all these candidates
 
just not equal. So, all these candidates
are like, well, my base is 200K plus a
 
are like, well, my base is 200K plus a
 
trying to get them, doesn't have a
 
trying to get them, doesn't have a
bonus. So, they're like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do we do
 
bonus. So, they're like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do we do
a sign on bonus? Do we do higher
 
a sign on bonus? Do we do higher
guaranteed comp? Like it's this vicious
 
guaranteed comp? Like it's this vicious
cycle where folks are kind of stuck
 
cycle where folks are kind of stuck
right now on this. And
 
right now on this. And
I get why. And the other thing I think
 
I get why. And the other thing I think
about bonus programs, I said once that
 
about bonus programs, I said once that
toothpaste is out of the tube, you can't
 
toothpaste is out of the tube, you can't
put it back. Like you got to think about
 
put it back. Like you got to think about
this because once it sounds so easy,
 
this because once it sounds so easy,
yeah, let's do a bonus program. You're
 
yeah, let's do a bonus program. You're
stuck. You try to get rid of that. It's
 
stuck. You try to get rid of that. It's
very difficult. And the irony is you're
 
very difficult. And the irony is you're
completely right. like at these series B
 
completely right. like at these series B
even C companies that are moving so fast
 
even C companies that are moving so fast
and things are so dynamic it turns into
 
and things are so dynamic it turns into
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show like every year because it's
 
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show like every year because it's
almost impossible to accurately forecast
 
almost impossible to accurately forecast
whether it's churn whether it's revenue
 
whether it's churn whether it's revenue
whether it's Mau Dow whatever it is and
 
whether it's Mau Dow whatever it is and
then you're you're always in this
 
then you're you're always in this
position of like well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we didn't hit
 
position of like well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we didn't hit
it but
 
it but
&gt;&gt; it was out of it was out of their
 
&gt;&gt; it was out of it was out of their
control like you know it was so far off
 
control like you know it was so far off
or we're so far over the cat. It's like
 
or we're so far over the cat. It's like
we're now we're at 200% of payout. Like
 
we're now we're at 200% of payout. Like
it's just insane. So, I actually don't
 
it's just insane. So, I actually don't
like them for those reasons. If you can
 
like them for those reasons. If you can
get away with not doing it, you guys, I
 
get away with not doing it, you guys, I
wouldn't I wouldn't do it. I would try
 
wouldn't I wouldn't do it. I would try
other aspects. And I don't know about
 
other aspects. And I don't know about
you, but as an executive, I told some I
 
you, but as an executive, I told some I
told someone this a couple years ago.
 
told someone this a couple years ago.
I'm like, I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about a
 
I'm like, I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about a
bonus. 20 30 40% like the equity is why
 
bonus. 20 30 40% like the equity is why
I'm there. to your point, I'm not going
 
I'm there. to your point, I'm not going
to like work harder because of the 30%
 
to like work harder because of the 30%
bonus. I don't think in my mind that it
 
bonus. I don't think in my mind that it
actually intrinsically motivates people
 
actually intrinsically motivates people
as much as people think. The last thing
 
as much as people think. The last thing
I'll say is a lot of these companies put
 
I'll say is a lot of these companies put
them into place and it's at a certain
 
them into place and it's at a certain
level or like certain teams have them
 
level or like certain teams have them
and other teams don't. That is insane to
 
and other teams don't. That is insane to
me. either don't do it or do it
 
me. either don't do it or do it
consistently where it's paid out in a
 
consistently where it's paid out in a
way where the company is rowing together
 
way where the company is rowing together
in a consistent manner. I mean this all
 
in a consistent manner. I mean this all
over the place, some teams having it,
 
over the place, some teams having it,
some don't, some levels, some not. I
 
some don't, some levels, some not. I
don't understand that.
 
don't understand that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um and that can cause a lot of strife.
 
&gt;&gt; Um and that can cause a lot of strife.
&gt;&gt; Now, you do agree that all sellers
 
&gt;&gt; Now, you do agree that all sellers
should have a bonus. Yeah. Like that's
 
should have a bonus. Yeah. Like that's
there's no argument there.
 
there's no argument there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not talking about commission
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not talking about commission
plans. I'm talking about Yeah. a
 
plans. I'm talking about Yeah. a
variable component.
 
variable component.
on top of the salary.
 
on top of the salary.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the putting it the toothpaste back
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the putting it the toothpaste back
in the tube comment just to talk about
 
in the tube comment just to talk about
this. So, like walking these back is
 
this. So, like walking these back is
brutal and I've done it. And by the way,
 
brutal and I've done it. And by the way,
this bonus, it was like a Christmas
 
this bonus, it was like a Christmas
bonus at one of the companies that I
 
bonus at one of the companies that I
worked at and it was based off of how
 
worked at and it was based off of how
the company was performing. But like
 
the company was performing. But like
people anchor to like I'm getting this
 
people anchor to like I'm getting this
&gt;&gt; totally.
 
&gt;&gt; totally.
&gt;&gt; And so one year the company didn't hit
 
&gt;&gt; And so one year the company didn't hit
and they still gave it. Then I joined
 
and they still gave it. Then I joined
and I was like what is this dissonance?
 
and I was like what is this dissonance?
Like are we doing this or not? And then
 
Like are we doing this or not? And then
of course the CFO always is like the
 
of course the CFO always is like the
first person pushing for the bonus
 
first person pushing for the bonus
program and the first p person pushing
 
program and the first p person pushing
to eliminate the bonus program. It's
 
to eliminate the bonus program. It's
like the boat owner, right? The first
 
like the boat owner, right? The first
day you buy it is your best day and the
 
day you buy it is your best day and the
day you sell it is your best day. the
 
day you sell it is your best day. the
CFO is that same person. And so like we
 
CFO is that same person. And so like we
end up walking this back and there was
 
end up walking this back and there was
like riots in the streets and people are
 
like riots in the streets and people are
like what the hell is going on here?
 
like what the hell is going on here?
Like this is supposed to be part of my
 
Like this is supposed to be part of my
compensation plan. And obviously like
 
compensation plan. And obviously like
you know we had bumped up salaries and
 
you know we had bumped up salaries and
those but people don't think that way
 
those but people don't think that way
and it's very very challenging like with
 
and it's very very challenging like with
any benefit that you roll out at the
 
any benefit that you roll out at the
company walking it back it's like you
 
company walking it back it's like you
know it's why we don't do any social
 
know it's why we don't do any social
security uh changes in government. It's
 
security uh changes in government. It's
like once they have it, you can't take
 
like once they have it, you can't take
it away. So that is exactly true.
 
it away. So that is exactly true.

&gt;&gt; We talk a lot in tech about technical
 
&gt;&gt; We talk a lot in tech about technical
debt, right? We talk a lot about the
 
debt, right? We talk a lot about the
codebase and tech debt and it's like,
 
codebase and tech debt and it's like,
you know, this is how like engineering
 
you know, this is how like engineering
leaders, you know, once every five
 
leaders, you know, once every five
sentences tech debt is mentioned as a
 
sentences tech debt is mentioned as a
legitimate constraint as to why they
 
legitimate constraint as to why they
can't move faster. We never talk about
 
can't move faster. We never talk about
people debt. It is like never discussed
 
people debt. It is like never discussed
at all. It's like, well, you just like
 
at all. It's like, well, you just like
do the thing and then like this is this
 
do the thing and then like this is this
is exhibit A of how people debt
 
is exhibit A of how people debt
accumulates. So, you know, hairbrain
 
accumulates. So, you know, hairbrain
executive was brushing his teeth this
 
executive was brushing his teeth this
morning and decides like we should have
 
morning and decides like we should have
a bonus program because it's really
 
a bonus program because it's really
going to motivate people, right? We sit
 
going to motivate people, right? We sit
down at the exec meeting. You know,
 
down at the exec meeting. You know,
people like me, you and Kelly are all
 
people like me, you and Kelly are all
like, "Okay, here's the second order of
 
like, "Okay, here's the second order of
this. like what happens if we ch and and
 
this. like what happens if we ch and and
you know this is where we get the
 
you know this is where we get the
naysayer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right to where they're
 
naysayer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right to where they're
like oh like of it's always the can't do
 
like oh like of it's always the can't do
team you know there they go again and
 
team you know there they go again and
it's like no we're just trying to help
 
it's like no we're just trying to help
you like we can roll it out but we're
 
you like we can roll it out but we're
just helping you think through second
 
just helping you think through second
order consequences here then we roll it
 
order consequences here then we roll it
out and then the company pivots or the
 
out and then the company pivots or the
product dramatically changes or a new
 
product dramatically changes or a new
competitor enters the space and
 
competitor enters the space and
everything that we had built these
 
everything that we had built these
assumptions off of is now decimated.
 
assumptions off of is now decimated.
So, not only can we now not focus on the
 
So, not only can we now not focus on the
core thing, which is how do we solve
 
core thing, which is how do we solve
this new problem, we have to like
 
this new problem, we have to like
actually think about this other
 
actually think about this other
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this debt that has now
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this debt that has now
accumulated that we have to go make an
 
accumulated that we have to go make an
interest payment on before we can solve
 
interest payment on before we can solve
the real principal problem. That's the
 
the real principal problem. That's the
thing that I don't think people really
 
thing that I don't think people really
understand. But it's so hard to
 
understand. But it's so hard to
articulate that to executive team.
 
articulate that to executive team.
&gt;&gt; I know it's one of those things we're
 
&gt;&gt; I know it's one of those things we're
like, I get it. I get it. Brushing the
 
like, I get it. I get it. Brushing the
teeth. Hey, we should do a bonus
 
teeth. Hey, we should do a bonus
program. And
 
program. And
&gt;&gt; totally
 
&gt;&gt; totally
&gt;&gt; and then we hear that and literally like
 
&gt;&gt; and then we hear that and literally like
a flash of light. It's like you can see
 
a flash of light. It's like you can see
your life like in a flash in your mind.
 
your life like in a flash in your mind.
I can think through all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all
 
I can think through all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all
the scenarios, all the stuff in like 3
 
the scenarios, all the stuff in like 3
seconds in my head. Like how do I
 
seconds in my head. Like how do I
explain this? And the best way I can
 
explain this? And the best way I can
explain it is to your point is not to
 
explain it is to your point is not to
say no, but it's like listen before we
 
say no, but it's like listen before we
do this, it's like before you get
 
do this, it's like before you get
married to someone, make sure that you
 
married to someone, make sure that you
think through because once that
 
think through because once that
toothpaste is out, it is hell on earth
 
toothpaste is out, it is hell on earth
to put it back in. And and frankly, it's
 
to put it back in. And and frankly, it's
kind of hellish to even implement a
 
kind of hellish to even implement a
bonus program because it's usually
 
bonus program because it's usually
fraught with, well, now you're not going
 
fraught with, well, now you're not going
to get a merit increase. Your raise is
 
to get a merit increase. Your raise is
this variable component.
 
this variable component.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. that may you may or may not
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. that may you may or may not
get. It's a whole thing. And I really
 
get. It's a whole thing. And I really
believe this. I don't care how much, you
 
believe this. I don't care how much, you
know, how many metrics and hard numbers
 
know, how many metrics and hard numbers
you tie to this for people in their
 
you tie to this for people in their
mind. To your point, they already have
 
mind. To your point, they already have
calculated it. They've already bought a
 
calculated it. They've already bought a
car because this is coming.
 
car because this is coming.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then you're screwed because if you
 
&gt;&gt; And then you're screwed because if you
don't think through it, you don't have
 
don't think through it, you don't have
metrics, right? You and I have been at
 
metrics, right? You and I have been at
companies. Well, we'll just do MBOs, you
 
companies. Well, we'll just do MBOs, you
know, judgment.
 
know, judgment.
That's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you're basically
 
That's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you're basically
giving it to them. It doesn't exist that
 
giving it to them. It doesn't exist that
managers actually apply judgment without
 
managers actually apply judgment without
numbers and say, "Well, you're going to
 
numbers and say, "Well, you're going to
get 70%, you're going to get
