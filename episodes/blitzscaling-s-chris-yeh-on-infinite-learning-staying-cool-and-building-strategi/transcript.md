# Blitzscaling's Chris Yeh on Infinite Learning, Staying Cool, and Building Strategic Networks

## Transcript

 
For today's essential heretics 101
feature, Chris Yay discusses infinite
learning, staying relevant, blitzcaling
adaptability, assessing founders through
shared experiences, and negotiating
equity by prioritizing process over
numbers. All right. Hi everyone. Welcome
to another episode here of HR Heretics.
I am so happy to have Chris Yay here.
I've been a fan for probably like 20
years and seen you speak a bunch of
times. I don't even know how to talk
about your background because it's
literally spans author, venture partner,
mentor, academic instructor, co-founder,
and board member. I'm so humbled to have
you on, Chris, and it's so good to see
you again.
&gt;&gt; So, Chris, the thing that strikes me
about you is you just have this palpable
energy. Where does that come from, and
how does somebody who has been around
the block as many times as you have been
around still have that much juice? So I
will give it credit to a couple things.
The first baseline level is as you know
there is this notion of a set point for
happiness that people have and so mine
is jammed way up and so I'm just
generically one of the happiest most
optimistic people you're going to meet
and that helps drive the energy. The
second thing I would say is that I have
a long history of public speaking and
performance. I went to Stanford as an
undergraduate. I studied product design,
engineering and creative writing, but
also very critically I studied drama and
improvisational acting. Uh I studied
public speaking and then taught public
speaking for the engineering school. I
studied peer counseling and then was a
peer counselor for years. And of course
I was part of an improv comedy troop for
a number of years as well. The audience
is going to have a good time if the
speaker is having a good time. And the
audience is going to feel energetic if
the speaker is energetic. If you've ever
seen venture capitalists speak on stage,
the vast majority are the most boring
people imaginable. I'm like, "No." Like,
I love entrepreneurs. They're
incredible. When I see an entrepreneur
and I think that they've got it, I'm
like, "Wow, I got to spend more time
with this person." I mean, show you're
excited. Don't just say you're excited.
&gt;&gt; So, Chris, I watched your TED talk
around infinite learning, and I love
this quote from you. You said we often
praise people for learning new things,
but I'm going to suggest that we should
also praise them for unlearning old
things. Unlearning, I find, is a skill
that most people are not good at. Why do
you think that's the case? Well, it's
very simple. We as human beings don't
like uncertainty. I mean, I can
remember, think back to what happens on
the first day of school, like, oh my
god, I'm so nervous. What's going to
happen? And then by the end of high
school, you're like, I got this dialed
in. I know what's going on. And we like
that feeling of being a confident
senior, not a scared freshman. But the
fact is that as the world changes around
us, it doesn't matter how confident we
feel, we really are that scared
freshman. We really do have to learn
something new.
&gt;&gt; Chris, you you've been doing all of
these wonderful things since the mid
 
how have you stayed relevant?
&gt;&gt; So what do I do to stay relevant? There
are a couple things. The first the most
important thing is continue to develop
friendships and relationships with
people who are young or young at heart.
And I jokingly say, oh, you know, my
young friends are now old. It's time to
get a new set of young friends. But it's
literally true. And being an instructor
helps with that, right? Having a college
like Stanford bring a supply of young
people to me is always a very a useful
thing to have happen. I try to see what
they're doing. And so part of it is just
tapping into things that are happening
that are new. And part of that for me
also means keeping track, and this
sounds crazy, but keeping track of
popular culture, right? So, I try to
keep track of popular culture, not
because it's necessarily like super
relevant to the things I do, but because
it's relevant to understanding what
people are thinking about and what
matters to them. And the most important
thing about being cool, as everyone
knows, is the best way to be cool is to
not care about being cool. And if you
don't care about being cool, then people
say that's cool.
&gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. So, I want to
talk about Blitzcaling for a second. And
so this is the book that you co-authored
with Reed. And look, I think one of the
truths about Blitzcaling is that
companies in this mode are constantly
changing and evolving. And it makes me
think that two of the most important
skills to hire for when you're thinking
about employees at bullets scaling
companies is adaptability and
resilience. How do you assess people for
those skills?
&gt;&gt; So adapting and resilience, 100% agree
those are critical. So, how do you tell
if somebody is adaptable? Well, it's
hard, right? One of the things that Reed
has taught me over the years, and
something he's mentioned a number of
times, is that to assess someone, we
believe in what we see with our with it
with our own eyes. The problem is our
own eyes lie and it's difficult in a
halfhour interview to really assess
someone. And one of the things Reed says
is it's far more important to go ahead
and check references and talk to people
who've interacted with that person for
thousands of hours because that person
cannot have hidden their true self for
thousands of hours. And we did a whole
bunch of stuff during the pandemic
talking about blitz scaling during the
pandemic. And one of the things we did
early on is we talked about Airbnb and
we said here's the thing you have to
understand about blit scaling. It is
relative. It is contextual. And so you
look at Airbnb and you say, "This is a
company that has lost 100% of its
revenue overnight
and that had to lay off 25% of their
people." You're like, "How are they
going to recover?" And our response was,
"You know what they don't have? They
don't have a bunch of leases and
mortgages on empty hotels that they've
got to pay for. In fact, the competition
they're facing is hurting even worse.
And if Airbnb adapts to this new reality
and gains market share relative to their
competition during this period, which
they should be able to do, they're going
to exit this pandemic looking stronger
than ever. And this was one of the great
calls of all time because less than six
months later, the company was going
public.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. I think one of the misnomers
with blood scaling, people just think it
it means like hire a bunch of people,
like go hire. How does it relate to like
the number of people? How do you think
about that and how does that apply to
blitz scaling in your philosophy around
it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we I do believe that AI makes
blitz scaling easier in some ways
because of the fact that individual
human beings can be much more productive
than before. I
think that it's possible that there will
be a billion-dollar company in the next
 
think it's going to be a major trend
because AI can amplify, but there is
still extreme value to people working
together.
&gt;&gt; Obviously, the success of an investor is
determined by how well they can pick a
company. I think picking where you work
is going to be a huge determinant of
your career success.
Do you think there's overlap between
what investors should be thinking about
when they pick companies and what
employees should be thinking about when
they pick companies?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. If you are part of a winning
team, so many benefits occurr. And so if
you are an employee, if you're looking
out for your own career, obviously you
want to be on a rocket ship, not only
because it'll provide you with huge
amounts of money potentially, but
because it will accelerate your career.
It'll be a huge brand value for you.
it'll make all these other things
possible. So, as an individual employee,
you should put on your investor hat and
try to figure out, do I believe this is
going to be a massive success? The other
thing you have to do is you have to ask
yourself, who are these people that I'm
going to be working with for the next x
years? That is really one of the core
reasons why you should pick a company
and because these are the people who you
are adding to your network who will be
the key collaborators that you are going
to work with in the future and I had
made decisions based purely on that
point. We were talking before we began
recording about our mutual friend David
Weekly. So I worked for David for a
while and here was what I told David
when he asked me to join and and help
him out is I told him I'm not looking to
get a job right now. I'm supposed to be
taking a quarter off. It's like, I need
you. I'm like, okay, David, here's how
it's going to work. Here is why I'm
going to work for you. It's not for the
money, although I hope that we make
money here, but what I need from you is
I need to connect with a whole younger
generation of technologists.
You, David, are really good at bringing
those people together. So, that's what
I'm looking for from you besides a
salary. And he agreed to that and was
good to his word. And that's how I met
so many of the people in the technology
community here in Silicon Valley. Chris,
in choosing, you know, these companies,
you know, one of the big big drivers is
working with the founder, CEO, like that
person. What is your advice on how to
sus out whether you're going to get
along with or that's the right founder
for you? How how do you best assess
that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that, you know, my hack
for doing this is, and it's not always
possible, but my hack for doing this is
to say, okay, well, let's go travel
somewhere together.
&gt;&gt; Wow. And the reason for that is I find
that people can be very good at
projecting a certain persona, but they
become very challenged at doing so after
the 10th hour of the flight or after
you've been sitting in a lounge for two
hours or after you've been stuck in
traffic. You start to see who the person
really is. And I call it the summer camp
effect.
But when you see people under those
circumstances where they can no longer,
you know, just put up their their face
and their shields and where you're
seeing the real person, then you get a
much better sense of do I want to spend
more time with it. Hey everyone, we'll
be right back in a moment after a word
from our sponsors. AI change is how work
gets done. Recruiting is no exception.
Meta View is the AI platform
purpose-built for recruiting. If you're
looking to level up your AI adoption and
see real impact from intake to offer,
it's a no-brainer. Metaview's suite of
AI agents works for you at every stage
of the hiring process. Their platform
powers instant job post creation, AI
powered candidate Q&amp;A, insights on
pipeline performance, compensation, and
so much more. I've seen firsthand how
tough it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in candidate
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metiv changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Metaview. Just head over to
metaviv.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts or get started for free. You'll
be uprun and AI enabled in minutes. We
talk a lot about comp negotiation and
we've done a lot in equity and all all
that jazz. But we haven't heard what I
think you know you had written down and
we talked a little bit about is
negotiating founder shares when you
yourself are starting a company. That's
a whole another ball of wax and how that
works because I got to tell you I don't
have any clue either.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let me explain how I got into
this to begin with. So, I started my
first company in 1999. I was at business
school and I was convinced that by the
time I graduated June 2000, the boom
would be over and that if I wanted to
make a mark in this particular boom, I
needed to do something now and
preferably start a company over the
summer and sell it before I had to go
back to school. But, you know, didn't
quite work out that way. I started the
company with one of my friends from high
school who fortunately for me and for
him had gone on to be one of the first
internet millionaires. He had created a
company, co-founded a company called
webcom that was a web hosting site and
it was acquired by Vario which was
acquired by NT and he walked away as a
cash millionaire starting in like 1998
or so. And so 1999 rolls around and we
decide we're going to start a company
together because we're good friends at
high school. And I'm like, I don't have
many other friends who are internet
millionaires. This seems like a good
idea. And but he was like, but you know,
he's like, but listen, I'm not the
software developer. I'm the operations
data center guy. We get a software
developer. So we brought on board one of
my friends from Stanford who happened to
be in my freshman dorm who happened to
be a brilliant computer scientist who
had won all these awards and things like
that. And so that was my introduction.
So we had this whole conversation which
was around okay well how much equity am
I going to get and because you know
first was just the two of us Thomas and
I we just simply divided up 50/50 I told
Thomas I insisted you take no I think I
can't remember we insisted that one of
us take 1% more and I think it was
probably me that took 1% more because I
was originally the idea holder behind it
I was the CEO but then when our friend
my my friend Albert came in we were like
we went online and we looked for what
you're supposed to offer someone coming
And he said, "Okay, well, how about 5%."
And Albert said, "Well, you guys are
super early and you're going to go
through a lot of dilution." Albert was a
pretty savvy guy. I don't think that's
going to work. I'm like, "Okay, let's
think about this. Let's figure out a
system that seems fair." Because the key
to me is decide on the process for
making the decision before you get to
the numbers. Because the numbers, people
will argue about numbers all day long,
but if you first get them to agree to
the process, then things will be better.
And so in that instance, what we did is
we had a discussion around, well, what's
the right ratio? Since you're coming in
later on, what's the right ratio between
the holdings of the two initial founders
and your founder, what is the level that
will feel fair to you? And we sort of
came up with this ratio of it should be
roughly 3 to one.
And that's relatively arbitrary, but
it's like, okay, we've agreed to that.
Then once we do that, we do the math and
we say, okay, if we have 3x plus 3x + 1x
is 7x, divide that. Okay, that means
that your share should be this percent.
And so that's where it ended up being.
That's how we made that decision. And
then we extended it further because we
at the end of the summer, I wanted to go
back to school. And the people who were
involved, the the like the the other
board members were like, "Whoa, whoa,
whoa. We need a CEO." So, we had to
recruit a CEO to come on board. So, we
recruited a CEO to come on board. And
Jim, who came in as CEO, asked for a
certain amount, and we agreed to it. And
I think in his case, he had asked for
 
again, this is a prefunded startup. So,
that was actually probably not enough.
And in fact, a month or so later, Jim
came back to me and said, 'You know, I
think I probably didn't do a good job of
negotiating. I think I probably should
have had more. And I said, "Well, Jim,
you know, we have a deal, but I'll tell
you what, go back and think about it for
a bit, and if you come back to me and
tell me that you want to change the
deal, we can look into it. But if not,
what I would just say is that there's a
long time to go in the life of this
company. there'll be other opportunities
to add, you know, stock options and
other things like that. I think that,
you know, you're going to do well and we
might just might as well just wait and
take care of it later because if we open
it up now, we got to go to the board and
do all this stuff. I think that things
will probably work itself out. And he
went away and a couple days later he
came back and said, you know, I gave my
word and I think you're right, so I'm
going to stick with what it is. So in
all these cases, the overarching
principles are decide on the principles,
not the numbers. The numbers come
second. Once you agree on the
principles, then it's easier to come to
agreement on the numbers. It's not
always easy. I've done things where I
had to get someone to agree. They had a
piece of papers that said they had 25%
of a company and I had to get them down
as low as possible. And I've had one
like eight hour conversation where I was
able to get someone from 25% to 6%.
&gt;&gt; Wow. I mean, 20ome years later, has that
process become more formulaic, Chris?
because the stories you're telling are
kind of like well this and that and that
I mean has it become more standard or is
it still kind of oh
&gt;&gt; I think it's still very much a wild wild
west now look there are better
benchmarks thanks to companies like
Carta that can show you how much
ownership people have but the fact is
those are still benchmarks every company
is a one of one and you still need to
recognize people's feelings you still
need to get them to agree on that
process first and I think that that's my
overarching message decide on a fair
process and then it's easier to get
everyone to accept the outcomes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. The process and principles.
I I love that. And Kelly, this is why
why companies want to have a
compensation philosophy. Like how do we
do compensation here? Let's talk about
that first before we get into the
numbers because once you get into the
numbers, everything just becomes like
can I get more? can you know and you're
you don't have any bedrock to which to
fall back on of okay like this is this
is the way that they do things and
there's a there's a method to the
madness and also like you're you know to
your point Chris around you are doing
deals with people we don't really view
like employment agreements as deals but
that's exactly what it is and when you
do a deal with another human you want to
make sure that the deal is based in
fairness and it has something of
substance underneath it and numbers are
not substance.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. But I will share one numbers
hack that I got from that CEO Jim Fitz
Simmons that we mentioned and it's this
whenever we for that company whenever we
prepared a job offer for someone we came
up with a package which you know is
typical right here's a salary here's a
stock option package we would create a
version that was more salary heavy and
lighter on stock and we create a version
that we create a version that was less
salary heavier and heavier on stock
because you don't know what a person's
indifference curve is and you doing your
best to put together what you think is
fair. But if you make those three
options along your indifference curve
and they pick one of the ones that you
didn't expect them to pick, you just
created value.
&gt;&gt; I love that.
&gt;&gt; Chris, you're an absolute legend. Thank
you so much for spending an hour with
us. I I learned a ton from this
conversation and I know our audience is
going to as well.
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Chris.
&gt;&gt; Well, it is a delight. Hopefully, I was
able to maintain my energy throughout
and please feel free to have me come on
again. I don't know if you've, you know,
used up all my fund of stories, but we
can always find out.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chris.
&gt;&gt; Thanks all.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
