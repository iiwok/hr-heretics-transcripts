# Calibration Sessions Demystified

## Transcript

what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics Kelly we
got another dear Heretics coming at you
and this one's about calibration
sessions I just went through performance
review Talent calibrations at my company
and often found myself conflicted on how
much I should be facilitating the
process versus giving my opinions on
individual talent I feel like doing that
isn't remaining neutral how should I
think about balancing this what's your
take Kelly that's a great one and it
also parallels the question that we
often get and I've experienced is
offsites you know when you're
facilitating your executive offsite and
you're trying to contribute and what
does that look like it is a fine line
you know what I mean because our role is
to facilitate the calibration sessions
you know hold folks accountable to the
principles of your company to all the
ground rules of these sessions and make
sure that you're eliciting the right
level of feedback and honesty and then
on the other hand you have a lot of
experience with these folks especially
more senior level folks and so how do
you balance owning the process with
participating in it as a participant I
actually think both things are necessary
which makes
so much harder because it's not like the
easy thing is to say someone else
facilitate it and I'm going to you know
participate and give a ton of
feedback or I'm not going to say
anything about talent and I'm just going
to facilitate the process and I do
believe you have to balance both yeah I
think this is a fundamental question
that should not be answered during
calibration and instead should be
answered
before so in fact like it's a great
question because it's making me rethink
like how I've always done it and this is
what's happened to me historically which
is okay you know we just did the nine
box or whatever scoring system we did
this year which is different than last
year because it's always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
iterating and
then right and then and then it's like
oh my God like uh it it took longer than
expected or there was more work than I
thought and then calibration happens and
you're kind of just like scrambling to
like oh my God I barely slept last night
like you know here we are now let's go
calibrate and you know by the way that
there is an 11 box as well I don't know
Jesus know this that's just like let's
just boil the ocean while we're at it
anyways okay so here's the thing this
question made me think about it and be
like I think we should spend way more
time at the front end of this to say how
are we going to run this process who is
going to opine in the room and then who
is the decider
of the final score because often times
it kind of ends up being consensus e uh
or senior person wins sort of a thing
and that that's fine like that's totally
fine if that's what your process is but
I have historically found that it's
actually not codified and if you take
the time on the front end to codify how
the calibration will work then we could
just be like well this is what we had
agreed to so let's stick to these rules
and this is how we should do it now to
answer the question
specifically I absolutely think
whoever this HR person is should be
opining right like if you have data on
the person then you should explain what
that data is in the calibration session
that is the whole purpose of it the
problem is if you're judge jury and
executioner then everyone's going to
think you're
heavy-handed and you know you're in
charge of these things and and I
actually think HR should not be in
charge of actually setting the rating
for the employee unless it's on the HR
team right yes I totally agree so I've
heard a lot of beliefs that the HR
person is like the secret decider and
yes they're sitting there and to your
point please make that clear before you
start calibrations that's really helpful
because when you opine as you and I both
are greeen it's not from a place of like
coercion power decision- making process
invisible hand invisible hand yeah which
I actually like that it's just in a more
positive way
um that can be another segment so what I
do I don't know if it's right or wrong
but what I do is I usually insert last
and someone asked me this recently and
my response was
your participation should be very
thoughtful to be extremely
objective and not final right to present
your view as data points just like
everyone else because they'll hear it
differently from you they'll be like oh
that must be it then this person is
that's not true so make sure you use a
disclaimer saying this is from my
observations or whatnot if helpful
remain as objective as possible I have
heard you know folks in HR aine it's
based on like one shitty Behavior
pattern or what they said at like a
cocktail party like that's not objective
right or and so it has to be things that
are related to the business related to
the job Frameworks related to the level
and how you think about those at your
company and the values in a way where
that leader can take it just like
everyone else's information and distill
it yeah just like most things that HR
has to handle I always subscribe to the
New York Times test which is if what we
are saying behind closed doors ends up
on the front page of the New York Times
are we going to be okay with it like
obviously we don't want it to get out
but like are we going to be okay with it
and can we defend it and that's always
been my philosophy is like yes like
we're not trying to have these
conversations more publicly because it
will cause more harm than good and be a
distraction but in a world in which it
gets out we must be able to defend it in
a professional and objective way hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after word from our sponsors I must
admit I used to believe that AI didn't
actually exist in recruiting or HR that
is until my friend Heather do who leads
talented signal fire told me to check
out metav I got into the product and was
like Wow AI actually does exist in
recruiting and this product is sick
metaview is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for recruiting
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metav view changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation ation your people can focus
on creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out metaview head over to metav
view. a/ Heretics to talk to one of
Med's product experts tell them that me
and Kelly sent you or you could just go
to their website and get started for
free you'll be up running and AI enabled
in
minutes Kelly talk to me a little bit
about like just kind of going back to
First principles of
calibration why did we do it and what is
it for like what is the purpose yeah
it's a a very Artful process do you know
what I mean like some people love it
some people hate it and my opinion we do
this so that the company can
hold a consistent bar and build muscle
about talking about aike Talent as they
relate to one another these are areas to
make sure that we are not just like
raing Nolan in a vacuum and then all of
his peers it's to protect against the
natural subjectivity and bias that
humans have um in my opinion not just on
a one team like not just within
marketing but ideally across the whole
company right which is why I love the
higher level cross functional look and
talking about things related to the
universal career Frameworks right a
director of marketing director of
engineering director of Finance you
should be able to calibrate those Folks
at the first order of how your company
thinks about those levels even though
within their groups they're doing it
deep you know also including Technical
and functional skills of that area yeah
and the other side of the calibration
for me that a lot of companies Miss
Nolan is at least half of it is
forward-looking so half of the
calibration is performance and how folks
are doing and being Equitable fair and
you know having parity against like
roles I don't think we spend enough time
talking about so what are we going to do
with this person independent of the
function who are our nodes across the
company and our bets on people and
leaders what are we doing to keep them
who are we going to work with them can
they jump into different functions um
yeah succession planning and single
points of failure is a big problem in
organizations yeah so do we talk about
that so I aim to talk about that 50% of
the time and the other part 50% of the
problem is a lot of companies are so
immature in the first part they spend
the whole time talking just trying to
get a handle on that which makes sense
because it's an imperfect hard process
yeah yeah the first part is it to to get
it perfect is a Fool's errand it's not
possible so what I've seen is typically
there's you know the manager calibration
right which gets run through the hrbp
the hrbp will flag anything that they
think is a little off before it goes up
to either the director or the VP of the
org then the director of V of the org
will look at it then kind of make their
marks and then when you walk into the
room when you're talking about the level
or promotions that are under question
right it's usually somebody's like flag
something and then that's the only time
we have a live discussion about that
thing and then creating the Sacred Space
to actually have the discussion around
your go forward Talent plan because
there's no other time to do it I've
never seen another company do it outside
of the calibration session and so that's
actually I totally agree with you Kelly
that nobody talks about is like we get
so wrapped around the axle for the
rating and promotions and like debating
the these things when the way more
important discussion is what are we
doing with this person what are we
expecting from them in the next six
months how do we make sure like if they
decide to leave we have a backup plan
and those sorts of things yeah and some
indications of that like if there are
superstars at your company that I've
seen it so many times and all of a
sudden they're leaving they're like what
are you you're literally one of our
biggest bets you're wonderful no one's
ever told me that never heard thata
about options U which goes back to a
session we did a few days ago or last
week around retaining top talent and how
you do that um the other thing Nolan is
I again these are all layers of
evolution and maturity like you can't
just go do these things unless the
foundation below it is strong you know
um yeah but ultimately these things are
transparent across the company every
employee knows that you know you do
calibrate Talent every employee knows
how you do it let's just say use a nine
box ideally I I I am showing you this
nine box and being like here's where
you're at here's why here's how I love
to talk about what you want to do next
or where we want to go it's a really
powerful visual it's just it's almost
like comp transparency you can't do that
unless you have such a good handle on
your process and your philosophies and
all Corner cases and why you do it the
trick is and the HR team can't just have
that or a few Executives every manager
has to internalize that and be gred it
before you make those things transparent
yeah and these things are they're
iterative approaches right the first
time you do it it's like nobody knows
what's happening
basically right it's a disaster and we
should be okay with that that's my point
exactly like set the expectation that
we're building a muscle here and it's
like going to the gym it's like you
don't go to the gym one time and get
jacked like that's just not how it works
in fact like we have to eat right all
the
time happens to you you told me it was
definitely not I do not have that
genetic bug my buddy Ryan does he works
out for a week in his jacked but like
that's just the reality of the thing is
just like we have to eat right all the
time you know we have to have a
consistent basis of when we do this and
then as time goes on it's Progressive
overload it's like great well we did
this last time now we could take a step
forward most importantly though where
the analogy doesn't hold is setting
those expectations with the company so
everyone is aware of like what we're
doing so it doesn't become this like uh
oh you know calibration day like there
they go into the room I wonder who
they're talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about now which is
how this thing devolves into so many
companies and it becomes super toxic and
I'll leave like one of my last points is
a real one so um you know I'm doing an
interim CPO roll like Quizlet for the
entire year we're going through this we
just went through the end of year
calibration kind of like you said Hot
Mess some good spots just kind of fine
all the only the executives use nine box
and whatnot so we're like one we're
doing this every six months building
muscle I think every three months is
like quite the gauntlet to through when
they're trying to execute a business so
probably a touch point though
right maybe um but in this case we need
to like I was going to say so we're
doing it every six months to build
muscle and this next one we're having
every Manager work the nine box and get
comfortable with it and so we're going
to spend the next three months wrapping
everyone's head around the nine box what
it means how to use it potential
succession planning so we can apply it
at the mid year and hopefully keep
building the muscle and get jacked yeah
here's the the short story for everybody
is that this is an imperfect process
right every company is different and how
they do it that's what's so fun about
the space is that we can all learn from
each other so let us know in the
comments like what you guys do what's
been working for you also like let us
know if you feel safe what's not worked
because that's also helpful for people
and this is how the profession continues
to progress so please share your
thoughts in the comments and let us know
what you guys think thanks all see you
