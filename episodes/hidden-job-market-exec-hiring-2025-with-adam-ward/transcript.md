# Hidden Job Market: Exec Hiring 2025 with Adam Ward

## Transcript

 
[Applause]
[Music]
 
what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today we
have the head of talent and head of
people Wiz Adam Ward what's up man
welcome to the show hey how are you
thanks for having me so unfortunately
Kelly's sick today also known as she's
playing hookie uh hope you feel better
Kelly but we will run the show without
you so I want to talk about like what's
going on in the market today you are
probably hiring more heads of talent and
heads of people than just about anybody
so just give me like a brief rundown
we're filming this on January 22nd
 
adum yeah well I won't go into the world
but I'll go a state like the talent
world you know I think it's very
interesting right now because
we're starting a new year and we have a
backlog of delayed hiring in terms of
heads of people and heads of town that
are starting to
unblock balanced by a lot of these roles
are still pocket listings if you're
familiar with the real estate term you
know apocalyps meaning that house that
never goes on the market is kind of sold
through like a whisper Network through
your real estate agent that's very
similar to the market right now so if
you're a people or Talent leader and
thinking like hey I'm okay where I am or
maybe even unhappy where I am but I want
to pick my head up or put my toe in the
water it's quite a frustrating
experience because normally you would
typically go to if you're a leader and
exec to some search firms if you're
maybe like midlevel maybe you look you
job postings but really not a lot of
that is happening on either side rather
CEOs or chro or hiring managers are
going to like kind of their trusted
Network it's like hey who do you know
that might be great right so that's how
like this word is getting out and how a
lot of these hires are being H happening
so if you look at from external
standpoint when you try to see the
market it's really hard to understand
what's going out there because if you go
to the search room hey are you all busy
like yeah we're busy but they're not
seeing all the searches even
collectively there's a whole lot of
roles being filled kind of on the side
for example if you like looked on your
LinkedIn two weeks ago in January and
you're like ah I didn't know that person
was looking and that company was hiring
a CPO because that that happened through
a you know a whisper Network broker
exchange type of situation okay so I
agree with you I'm seeing exactly the
same thing why like why is that
happening why aren't companies posting
roles on the website like they used to
and then you know typically what used to
happen in the past was like we'd post a
role we'd like try to Ping a bunch of
people over the course of two weeks we
would fail and then I would call you and
say all right Adam help me Sol this
problem yeah I think there's three
reasons so one is Supply demand both
like the perception of like a lot of
Supply out there in the reality of
Supply so the perception is there's a
lot of Supply great talent out there
false that's like you know that that's
false that there's a lot of amazing
talent on the market ready to find next
roles true a lot of Supply but maybe not
a lot of great Supply so there's that
perception of like hey I don't need to
do this because I can just go tap
someone who is readily available the
second is you know if you post it you
know historically before you would like
ask maybe internal recruiters or others
on the team to help do it but now you're
getting inundated with a lot of poor
quality Supply that the team doesn't
have have time to be able to work their
way through leading to into like a
pretty negative brand perception or
Canon experience out there and then the
third is that there is this like subset
of people who don't want to put their
hand up because they maybe are in a
company they are like reasonably happy
but they wouldn't mind hearing about
opportunities and so they have been like
talking to their local networks they're
like those bonds are true and there are
some great connections out there but
there people are a little bit of PTSD of
like is the grass really greener maybe I
should stay here but I also don't want
to miss out on things but I also don't
want to be exposed to my CEO that I
might be open to New
Opportunities so I want to talk about
like what makes a good head of people
and head of talent leader to CEO but you
just mentioned this whisper Network
thing and I think a lot of people who
are listening to this right now are like
well that's not fair like I'm not
getting opportunities that way and if
you're one of those people Adam like
what is your advice to them to have
better networks and to build these
networks such that when these
opportunities come up they are in the no
versus in the dark yeah let's also just
recogniz like hiring has never been fair
so to believe that galarian you know is
like a Miss no more to start but there's
a lot of things you can be do to like if
you're in that moment or be prepared for
that moment which is like thinking about
you know people talk about this like
Board of advisors or you know that
people kind of keep like you know formal
or informal mentors and advisers but
thinking about who are those people that
you've just clicked with over the Arc of
your career people who are just maybe
have the same shared values as you you
just kind of really always clicked when
you've talked or you had like this
 
was like way pithier than a 45 minute
conversation with someone else we
probably all can think about those
people but yeah even spending 15 or 20
minutes going back through and think
about who are those people why that
matters is one they're much more likely
to help you because you did click with
them two they probably have shared
values with you that they are going to
be a decent proxy for you out there on
the market of things that if they're
like well that sounds interesting it's
also more likely be interesting for you
right so you kind of want to build that
long list of people you might overlay
that with like hey are they like
relatively plugged into to like what's
happening in the market either because
they just love networking and being
aware or maybe their job somewhat
requires it so you think about building
that list of people that might have it
and and then it's a somewhat fixed list
because you're going to go back to them
on a regular basis because my advice is
this once you have it think about
putting those 10 to 15 20 people on a
every two to three week four week
rotation where you're checking in with
them totally so there's an initial
conversation that you have of like hey
here's where I'm at here's my framework
of what might be interesting to me
here's like the three short you know
bullet points that you want to remember
I'd love to hear about opportunities you
think that you you have out there that
could be interesting that might come in
your way would love to hear about them
but you don't stop there right every two
or three weeks you're checking in with
them on a no action update which is like
hey Nolan great to catch up three weeks
ago thanks so much for your time hey as
a reminder here's the three things I'm
looking for and here's a couple
conversations I've had or things that
have looked interesting let me know
everything comes your way what that does
is it resets the lens through which like
the next 36 hours that you interact with
people slack groups your email whatever
and you kind of reset the clock for them
and you know spread those 20 people out
over different weeks weeks you kind of
work through those and continue to keep
up to with them there's no action for
them right and it's really easy for them
to help you because they can literally
copy and paste a blurb about you those
three bullet points
whatever but sometimes there will be
actually like hey noan great to talk saw
this opportunity saw you're connected if
it feels right if you're open to it
would love an intro to this person
here's a copy paste thing that you could
send to that person and here's their
email address yeah I was talking to a
friend this morning about exactly this
topic and I feel like one of the things
most people do really poorly is cold
outbound like they're just bad at
communicating that way and so my view is
is like instead of uh instead of just
sending like an ask all the time just
say like what's up to people or say like
congratulations when things happen um
you know the example that I used the
other day was I saw this company who had
built a new product I know the CEO they
launched it on Twitter and I was like yo
like this is sick congrats and I even
think instead of like making a specific
ask just just like putting yourself in
front of them expands your surface area
of luck like now all of a sudden that
person's thinking of me because I said
that and so it's it's I think there's
different types of touch points too
right Adam it's not just like hey like
think of me for this job because then
you kind of get annoying it's also just
like like hey saw you did this thing
like congratulations or was thinking of
you today like hope you're killing it
like just little things like little
human things like that go a long way
yeah and you see it over my head the
book give and take from Adam Grant
totally you're a taker like you're less
likely to get help right people
generally do want to help people but
when it feels authentic and it's
relatively easy for them to do they want
to do the last thing is like you're also
just being a good Human by being excited
for them being interested offering to
help them too you know a taker is like
totally you help me a a a giver is like
hey I need some help but also how can I
help you hey thought of this for you
would this be interesting and so just
being a good person as weird as that and
as you know trit as that sounds um
actually is very helpful when you are in
that time of need as well totally all
right so let's go back to this supply of
good people and talent leaders yeah in
my mind the only barometer of good
actually comes from the CEO and nothing
else matters like what your peers think
doesn't matter uh like what what we want
to be true doesn't matter what really
matters is what CEOs think good people
and talent leaders have as their skill
set what are they telling you when
they're opening up searches and they're
talking to candidates about what they
find as the qualities that they want in
their next hire yeah I think there's two
camps there's one who they don't know
what great looks like and what good is
and the second who think they do and
have to go through like a long process
to discover it and so the first Camp you
know maybe is like starting at the
beginning you know maybe even through
pain there was like Hey I'm not sure
what great looks like can you help us I
andan like there's lots of ways I can
talk through DCL like how we do that
those that do and like what our data has
showed over time or those that get to a
point of view on what good looks like
what we've looked at over time is we
often look at these like think about as
a 2 by two which would be like
experiences and characteristics as your
columns and your rows might be must have
and nice to have so the upper right
being the must have characteristics is
honestly what matters most between good
and great the number one characteristic
we've seen over you know six plus years
of doing these searches is some version
of
business-driven meaning they think about
how the people or talent in the
organization that is there or they need
to get will help them Drive business
outcomes and that's the lens through
which they operate they're like a
business leader first who happens to run
the people are Talent
function yeah like you hear this this
meme right in our community all the time
right which is like oh I'm business-
driven but what is like how does it show
up like how does it actually show up on
a day-to-day basis yeah sometimes I
think one way it shows up is being the
person who's talking the CEO out of a
people program we're talking them out of
a hire right where the perception
historically was the the the HR leader
the talent leader was selling me on a
person on a program and it was kind of
like a build build build type of thing
where all of a sudden you're like how do
we get all this infrastructure all this
people programming is it really driving
so I real Vis tactically might look at
the okrs for the quarter a half and they
are mapping back every people process or
program or even person like is this
driving this forward or no and they're
willing to scale or cut that back
because they know it's not in service of
that outcome or even miss their personal
okr because you know I remember these
okrs we had at door Dash right which was
like hire 25 Engineers this quarter
right and that's probably a bad okr but
it's like everyone has it right and I
think what you're saying correct me if
I'm wrong
is you know I'm at 20 Engineers we have
three weeks left but we don't find the
great candidates that are meeting our
bar and like the hiring team is feeling
the pressure to like get to offer extend
and the the talent leader actually like
no we will not compromise we're just we
I'd rather miss this goal than hire
these people yes so two things I'll say
about that I just was off a call last
week with a recruiting leader who was
saying that they set their okr
recruiting around quality not number and
like it's move like so I see this moving
with like more Forward Thinking
companies because this number is you
just like think about the headcount
planning process in capacity it's kind
of an exercise in round numbers you know
we're not GNA H 121 we're gonna Hunter
 
so it's like it's false Precision so
then we put all this pressure around
falsely precise number you create all
this activity when it's really just like
a best guess at a moment in time often
months ago so when you recognize for
what it is then you actually can focus
on what really matters which actually
might be the quality coming in so like
that's one thing we do see this shift
moving away from a number the second
thing is like what gets measured gets
done so if the goal is just to hire 25
people and you're aized people they're
going to hire 25 people but they might
not be the the right people so just like
I think that setting the numbers can set
to like the wrong set of behaviors that
you're looking for is probably not the
right okr and really companies are
setting hiring goals for recruiting
teams or recruiters to make sure they're
keeping the the the the pedal down right
they're keeping the momentum going
forward they're not so I know at
Facebook they used to just set a number
for us that they knew we couldn't hit so
we wouldn't stop like they're like what
what can you do and you're like oh we
can do 100 like great the number is 200
like right so here's the amount of
resour like no no we're not giving you
more resources we are just going to
continue to push you so we're not
stopping we know you're not going to hit
it but we have to set a number that you
are will not slow down against you're
exactly right like that's why they do it
I actually think it has a perverse
incentive when you do that when you set
these audacious goals is like people run
around and contort themselves to try and
hit it and really the contortion means
we're lowering the bar and we're pushing
people through and so it's that's a
great example of uh a a business-driven
talent leader is able to say like it's
okay that we're going to miss but we
kept our bar high and we did not
compromise our standards as long as
we're defining like what that bar is and
like what that looks like that is like
that is the path I see the best people
and talent Leaders Moving towards they
they acknowledge the hiring plan and the
goal and they're obviously doing the
right resourcing but really the focusing
on is like the right business outcome
which is like the right people at the
right
time hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hes because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metav view changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
process medavie covers all your
compliance needs works with all your
existing tools and takes less than 3
minutes to set up join Talent leaders at
organizations like brex deal hellofresh
and quora and check out medavie head
over to metav view. a/ Heretics to talk
to one of Met's product experts tell
them that me and Kelly sent you or you
could just go to their website and get
started for free you'll be up running
and AI enabled in
minutes all right so going back to your
your Matrix so the top right corner
right is uh must have skills and
characteristics like what else is in
that box yeah it's often that they are
like a systems thinker like first
principles and you hear those terms a
lot so essentially they can break down a
pretty big problem into actional and
operational steps right so if on a CEO
I'm looking around my table and I have
my engineering leader I have my sales
leader Finance marketing they're all
they're all they're all Business Leaders
who are thinking about moving the
business forward and are really good at
taking a highlevel directive and
breaking it down into an actionable plan
so think about a product road map a
sales calendar or like a pipeline report
like we had not maybe moved far enough
along as people and talent leaders of
thinking about how do we operationalize
these things because we often think
about oh these are like we're working
with irrational units of humans and it's
we can't like put that into a box I
think we can do better than we have
historically of taking that objective
and tying it to how our people in our
town how we're going to drive that
forward yep that makes sense the other
one I hear I've heard recently is CEO
Whisperer yeah I don't think Whisperer
is the right word I think sometimes
you're a yeller sometimes you're a coach
sometimes you're coddler I think
Whispering has the wrong connotation of
puppeteering or in the corner you know
giving them the answers to the test yeah
maybe sometimes it is that but I think
that relationship between CEO and chro
head of people is so unique and special
because they they can be a lonely physan
because you are often the only person
sometimes that CEO can talk to about her
leadership team right sometimes there's
Whispering sometimes there should be
yelling and sometimes like we need to
hug it out you know but like the right
CPO knows you know what dials to be
turning when and based on what that CEO
needs at that time here's a good example
where we just did a search that was a
backfill for their former head of people
and we asked like hey what didn't go
right that last time and thato was like
my head of people essentially reacted in
the same same way I did every time so
meaning if I was like calm they were
calm if I was freaking out they were
freaking out like I need them to be the
counterbalance to me if I'm freaking out
they need to like be like no we got two
hands on the wheel here or if I'm not
freaking out I should be then like I
need that too and so often the
complimentary piece can be useful there
versus someone who is too sympatico with
them yeah and if you're a candidate like
that's actually a great question to ask
right most companies are not hiring for
the first time and if you are it's a
different set of questions but like you
know what what didn't go right with the
last person is a great insight for you
as you think about is this a place I
want to work yep yeah and often like
what ultimately Works in this role is
like our we values align not just as a
company together but like your values as
a CEO me as as a people person how we
apply those values might lead to like
some level friction but if you're you
know if you're lyed on these like core
values or first principles you're going
to be okay but you got to ask the right
questions to get to those see it's it's
the first question is probably not going
to get there it's just like a good
interview the better you are tunneling
tell me more about that oh like when we
click in on that then you're going to
get down to the core a little bit yeah
okay so I guess you know on the other
side of this is like what are the
qualities that Define the people leader
having trouble getting hired in today's
market yeah I think they may be you know
on a spectrum from like operational
excellence to spiritual leader you know
they're closer to the spiritual leader
you know more of the champion of the
people they they are coming across more
programmatically than operationally
strong there's a fear out there from
CEOs that they're going to hire AE of
people who's going to overbuild or over
architect
their people function and for some
companies who are maybe in more of the
startup land or growth stage one of
your few advantages against other
companies is your ability to move
quickly and when you put in too much
people layers you're like throwing away
one of the only you know competitive
advantages you have against some bigger
competition that you're trying to take
from and so that's I think there's this
fear in the back of Mind of CEOs that
you know that they're going to slow down
a bit as well all right Adam I want to
talk about the the polarity thing for a
second so uh one of you were telling me
before we started Taping that one of the
ways you help calibrate a CEO and a
broader team which I think is really
interesting because there's always like
CEO has something in mind and then
there's like the rest of the team talk
about the polarities and talk about how
you like bring this entire team together
to be like this is the the actual
profile we need to hire for yeah yeah
and you know what we learned
being inhouse before running these exact
searches is where searches took too long
when you are laundering alignment via
candidates so meaning some version of
like I'll know what good life looks like
when I see it or hey like let's bring in
some calibration candidates and we like
we'll use that to figure out what we're
looking for the problem with all that is
like crazy you know inherent bias that
happens uh intentionally and
unintentionally around you what a good
candidate looks like so what we try to
do before we look at any profiles is
really get into the objective things
that we're looking for and aligning the
stakeholders on it so if you think about
kicking off a search and we think about
some like characteristics candidates are
going to be on a spectrum of things so
it's not it's neither a one or a zero of
you know I used um operational
excellents for spiritual leader but
people are going to spike on a scale of
 
a particular role and as we hear about
like what matters and like what they're
looking for in terms of this person
building out the talent and culture and
people uh for this company we think
about okay what are some of like the
characteristics and what might be the
trade-off on those so we list those out
it might be like five or six and we do
oneon-one meetings with all the
important key you know people who might
give input or who might influence the
success of this role maybe not all
interviewers but they might be people
who are going to really have like a hand
in in this role and we do in person one
to one we ask them to think about those
sliders plot you know on this scale one
to 10 where you think they need to fall
against these two polls the only illegal
answer being five so they can't be dead
center they have to be you know left or
right of Center and of course our
technical stakeholders are often doing
 
will you know remember scorecards and
you know they're going they're doing the
same thing here you know and then what
we do is we like roll those up and we
overlay all of those points on the
Spectrum and show them to the CEO or
hiring manager be like hey here's where
we have gaps right and we need to close
those gaps not because not averaging
them but you as the highing manager need
to make a call on where you want this
person to fall relative on these
spectrums and then communicate that back
out to the stakeholders before we go to
search before we go to market on that
and so what's interesting about that is
uh one almost all leadership teams think
they're aligned going in and they never
are the second is you surface some real
like undercurrent misalignments that
just are showing up through this role
but actually like fundamental
differences in the direction of the
business or leadership or other things
so we often like pull up these like you
know coaching moments or other like team
building moments that they need to go
tackle but is just showing up in this
scoping of a role that's super interest
so you show it to the hiring manager you
don't show it to like the whole team and
then you basically give the action item
to the hiring manager to like go get
alignment yeah and we also rarely even
show who said what because that may not
matter right because they might even
themselves put their own weightage by
behind that person you know it may not
matter unless there's like something
really important like oh there's one
person out here consistently from the
team like oh that might be something to
go with your coach or someone else to go
figure out but there might be it
actually might be more topical than
person related and so like hey there's a
misalignment between whether we think
this person should be doing more of X or
more y let's figure that out if we're
not sure let me show you some example
profiles of what x looks like let me
show some example PR of why looks like
to kind of test that and test the edges
of the profile again so we're not
possibly missing out on a great early
candidate because we didn't have our
stuff together that's actually the next
one I want to talk to you about so yeah
can I let me say one more thing why this
matters this matters more for this role
than any other role because this person
is evaluating your company on two levels
one is this a great place for me in my
career Two does this leadership team
work well together and know how to
attract great
talent right and so they're getting
signals personally and professionally
and like companywide through the search
so having a better candidate experience
and more um structured one is actually
help you attract and close better
candidates it does seem like in today's
market a lot of exec teams and CEOs
think oh there's just like all this
great Supply you know they're just like
all over the place and like they don't
really care about the candidate
experience and I think candidate
experience actually in today's world is
a little bit of a fluffy term when what
you're saying is I am finding exactly
right and true it's like the best people
are typically already employed or have
many opportunities to be employed they
need to be like so many things have to
go right and the way I've been
describing it to some of my friends is
like it's like the devil you know where
you currently work versus the devil you
don't and it feels riskier than ever to
like go and take one of these
opportunities because of the bad
behavior in the interview process and
like the bad behavior just generally of
how like these exec team operates yeah
absolutely you know I love that I think
you're you're right there are a lot of
people who have like a very small
antenna up you know for the right
opportunity but are otherwise perfectly
happy and you know stable and if you
don't really show that you care about
them and how they can impact the
business you're not going to even be
able to activate them let alone get them
through the process and so I actually
think can experience in 2025 is going to
come back one as like as a really
important differentiator and partly
because in Fairly so a lot of our other
processes are going to be automated but
the most important crucial moments the
moments that matter in a hiring process
are still going to be very much human
Centric totally I I think it's going to
look more like free agency in
professional sports yeah like every you
know if a tier one quarterback in the
NFL gets to free agency which they never
do they have their pick of the
litter and I think that's what CEOs and
exec teams need to understand and is
that like just because your job is open
doesn't mean you've earned the right to
hire the best person for IT yeah and to
be fair you know over the last three
years when over hiring happened
including in the people function a lot
of CEOs had some bad experiences you
know a lot of CE heads of people had
some bad experiences there was like a
lot of rush to hiring like I need
someone oh my gosh like the market is
moving fast I got to grab someone and
that someone ended up not being the
right one and you know that changed and
soured how they think about hiring this
this next role so almost every hire dect
level is a reaction to the last high it
was like pendulum swing and often like
an over rotation to it to where like you
don't really need to get like someone
who's not from HR at all because you
have may experience but maybe need
someone who's maybe more like you know
operationally minded or business-minded
but we see these like pretty heavy
reactions to the last person they hired
that was maybe not the best Tire yeah
it's just what humans do right it's like
we just swing the pendulum like right
the other way and fenelli is the worst
at this on many levels but you know this
is another way that um we're not so
great at at the at these things let's
talk a bit about like these head of
talent and head of people roles so I
think another narrative that exists
right now is the role has
expanded and there's a lot for the
people leader to do
um I guess like how do you help help a
CEO understand like the what of like
what this person is actually going to be
doing versus like what the CEO is doing
versus how they work in Partnership
together and I guess like part two of
that is then how do we go and assess for
all of these skills like how are we
actually like in an interview process
understanding if somebody's good at
those things yeah I think there's two
ways that we think about this to like
service this is like what needs to get
done like what's build a bucket of those
things and then CEO like what are you
uniquely positioned to do and should you
be doing and then like that narrows down
that bucket so you have this original
bucket that's maybe narrowed down based
on what the CEO should or you know
uniquely position of doing and then
let's stack rank what matters most to
you and so maybe workplace or it is at
the bottom of that and then we like to
think about like what could someone else
be an expert in that could be
complimentary to the head of people so
yeah maybe we give them it but can they
hire a right-hand person who like owns
it because that's such a specialty area
versus what should they uniquely be
owning and not insourcing to another
person on their team right and so when
you kind of do that exercise it actually
comes quite clear on on what you're
looking for so once we kind of narrow
that down then like okay what are the
experiences and characteristics that we
think this person is going to need to
have experiences wise to be successful
and characteristics to be a great person
for our company and then we stack rank
that so stack ranking matters in a
couple for reason reasons so one the the
experiences become like your sourcing
plan right experiences are things that
you can visibly see on paper or quickly
reference were they at a company who
grew from 500 to a th000 you know have
they been through an IPO have they seen
our next stage or grow these have they
been in ass sass company these are all
sourcing strategies these aren't
assessment criteria these are just your
external filters and then your
characteristics become your assessment
process right and then the stack ranking
helps you do two things one is you
should be screening for the most
important characteristics as early as
possible so we're knocking out people
and helps you put weightage behind the
feedback that you get so what I see
happens a lot is you know we might as
you go through a hiring process um we
often have recency bias of a negative
a no late in stage on a number five
criteria versus number one knocks a
candidate out and we forget that they
spiked on one two and three what we said
objectively mattered most before we
started talking to people so I to look
for like reasons not to hire not because
like we have a high bar it's like oh
we're just we're humans and we remember
the last thing the last thing we
remember is kind of like a mixed
feedback type of thing so we pass but
hey but wait they have the experiences
we want in those three things that we
really care and we think we can coach
for and five because weally said those
matter less now you can change the
criteria as you learn more and need more
candidates but to put the wrong wage
behind them is why you miss out on some
great talent sometimes that's a really
good take on like you know recency bias
and how it creeps into the process
because you can get somebody aligned at
the beginning of the process and they're
like yeah this is the stock rate this is
what matters and they start talking to
people and then all of a sudden it's
like we start looking for the unicorn
candidate that's perfect at everything
and that's just like not the way the
world works with Talent everybody has
strengths and everybody has gaps and so
you know I talked to these CEOs all the
time who were just like they just want
the laundry list of like they've done
all these things you know plus like you
know they've seen the next St plus
they've had you just keep adding and
adding and adding and it's just like
it's never realistic yeah our data shows
that you know you you have five
experiences character a must have
everything after that adds an extra
month to your search so if you want to
run a six to n month search sure have
nine criteria but if you want to run an
average exec search which is like two to
three months you you know no more than
five on each side that's really
interesting okay if then like I think
CEO is dou if this then that like those
like that kind of like structure
typically resonates with them yeah and
even if you don't have the data I think
it's a powerful way to to to get
somebody aligned okay so let's talk
about the candidate side for a bit so if
I'm a
candidate what is the best way to
interact with you as a search firm yeah
um I think having that you know we
talked about a little bit earlier but
having that like clear crisp concise
framework is really helpful yeah we've
all probably tried to help friends who
might be looking for something like hey
like what might be exciting for you
you're like hey I'm actually pretty wide
open like that's really hard for us as
humans to think about through our mental
Network and Rolodex of like oh you
should talk to this person talk to this
person but when you have these really
clear ideas of what you're looking for
it's much easier to help place them the
best recruiters out there as you know
are excited to connect any candidate
with any opportunity 99% of them are not
going to be the one they're representing
but they intrinsically love to see great
people and great opportunities get
connected together and the easier you're
able to te that up for them the going to
be helping you slot you into a bunch of
opportunities that they even may not be
working on but if you're like hey I'm
pretty wide open they're going to try to
force you into the three to five
opportunities they personally are
working on they're going to try to force
fit you and JMU in then all a time you
get there and you're like you're timeing
conversation like maybe I should like
this now you start to sacrifice your own
criteria of what you're looking for so
just like we like to run structured
hiring for clients Canada is to run like
a structured search
meaning if you remember that 2 by two
that we talked about of experiences and
characteristics for a candidates
tangibles and
intangibles right split by must haves
and ni to haves tangibles are a specific
role or scope location in office
compensation things that can be like
seen on the surface the intangibles are
the culture of the company what makes
the CEO tick you know all those other
things that you're G have to like get
into a candidate process so just like
the experiences are your sourcing for
for a company your tangibles are like
how you're filtering but you're going
have to have conversations to really get
into some of the kind of the intangible
things that really matter to you so that
doing that work and continually going
back and refining it is a really good
way what I find candidates often do is
use the jobs to figure out like well
what's out there right like what's out
there using that as like a way to
um shape their search but we just talked
about you know 75% of these rols are
below the waterline of the iceberg in s
opportunity so you're better off
thinking more objectively what might be
exciting getting that word out into your
network and using the search firms to
communicate that you're GNA have much
better success with that approach yeah
the other thing I'm hearing in that is
like you're not their
therapist right like you you know this
is where um because it is an interesting
relationship right with the candidate
and the search firm yeah right is like
obviously like you probably go back
years and like you and I go back like a
decade and so like you actually kind of
can be my therapist because we're homies
yeah but like you know somebody who
doesn't have that depth of relationship
with you right and maybe somebody you're
meeting with for the first time like
they have to do this work on their own
with their own network and then as you
get deeper in the process like maybe
things change and that stuff is cool but
like there is a level of homework people
have to do for you to then be like oh
wow this is somebody I really want to
place because I know exactly what
they're optimized for and they're going
to make me as the exec recruiter look
good when I do the introduction to the
company which is one of the things
people don't talk about that really
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matters yeah yeah that it really
does and you know I'm probably why
you're a little different like I don't
mind doing a little bit of therapy work
with folks and like helping along the
journey I just love helping people
figure that out for their career and so
but it might take two or three calls so
maybe I'm not running the best business
that way because maybe not as efficient
but I do like to help people that way
but the more they're able to work
through those things and do that
homework the better the better position
they're going to be and yeah I think Kim
know that like recruiters are the ones
who are pitching and sometimes not even
pitching but maybe telling the candidate
they're hey I know to share the profile
with the CEO but they've already like
decide they're not any going to do that
you have to give them the reasons to be
able to do that you have to tee that up
for them so the your ability to like
logically talk through your career the
reasons by behind those Transitions and
then quick pivot looking forward here's
what I'd be excited about and clear
cryst way that's essentially like the
exact recruiter Playbook of what you're
doing here's their experiences here's
his motivations and here's why I'm
excited about them so you almost have to
get the recruiter excited about you so
they are representing you fairly in
proactive promisingly to that higher
major yep I don't think I've ever talked
to anybody about that I think that's
like a really good framework for people
to think about it which is like you know
ultimately Adam is going to be
presenting my profile and so I should be
as like in control as possible one for
me but two to make Adam look really good
because if I make Adam look really good
then like he's more likely to present me
to more companies and B at the top of
his role aex when a new role opens up
and he's thinking about me yeah and the
best recruiters I think can you know
subconsciously or you know behind the
scenes are mapping like oh your style or
characteristics are going to really
match well right so they need to go deep
enough with a person to understand their
motivations and like what makes them
differ like good and great and then
tease out what is it unique about this
company and this exec team that these
characteristics going to really kind of
plug in well to them and like that's
what really notches like that's why many
people might interview but very few
people are going to get to a final stage
because you use that assessment process
to get to those that values alignment
that values match yep okay so then last
thing for you is the nightmare situation
happens right which we've done all this
work Adam and you know we feel like
we've done it right we place the
candidate and then 60 days later you get
the call from either the company or the
candidate and they're saying it's not
working what's like the main reasons
it's
not I think there's there's two
categories of them so one is like
fundamental shift in the business which
is real and has happened a lot more the
last three years than the previous 13
years meaning the company isn't going to
be growing at the rate they thought like
they don't need that level person or
literally fundamental shift B hey we
actually are going hard pivot and we are
going this way we need something there
like a really deep X industry experience
so that happens not as often as the
other but it does happen like it's
happening more frequently as um we've
been kind of going through this last few
years I think that the second one was
where one of the two parties talked
themselves into it and so and often it's
more of a candidate talk themselves into
that opportunity like they probably had
some like pretty good intuitions that
this might not be right but you know
there has been it's like hey there
aren't a lot of these jobs out there I
want I need to get back in there I've
been maybe on the sidelines doing
fractional work or Consulting and like I
need to I need to get something and they
sacrificed one or more really important
things in their mind for the role and it
turns out even more than they thought is
like a key part to that job so meaning
like hey number one or two on their
intangibles was a leadership team that
really
values their talent in a demonstrated
way like hey I didn't really see that in
the process seems like they're really
maybe cutting back on things and then
they get in there so remember like
hiring managers are on their best
behavior during the interview process
candidates are on their best behavior
during the interview process so if you
get like an Intuition or an inkling of
something it's probably way worse
because everyone's showing up a little
bit better than maybe they even are
Behavior wise and so that kind of
unravels pretty quickly for them yeah
it's like a big you know trust your gut
and then also if you sniff something
yeah it is impendent upon you to go vet
that thing yeah and a lot of times
people are just like ah like kind of a
thing but like oh you know what like
like brush it off and to your point it's
like you're going to have to go live
with that every day yeah well you can
bet that that CEO is back channeling you
are you back channeling them right are
you back channeling that EXA team with
investors with people who used to work
there like you should be doing as much
if not more due Ence on them and they
are you they're paying someone to do due
diligence on you you don't have anyone
who's necessarily doing all the due
diligence you should be doing on that
that's gold Adam where can people find
