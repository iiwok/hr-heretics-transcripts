we're going to talk about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
wild windsurf situation of which like
 
wild windsurf situation of which like
literally news broke as we're like
 
literally news broke as we're like
getting on the call. So I think I have
 
getting on the call. So I think I have
all the details for the audience. I
 
all the details for the audience. I
apologize. Things are moving so quickly
 
apologize. Things are moving so quickly
here that things may change by the time
 
here that things may change by the time
you consume this and we are recording
 
you consume this and we are recording
this on July 14th at 1:00 Pacific time.
 
this on July 14th at 1:00 Pacific time.
So here's the high level. Windsurf was
 
So here's the high level. Windsurf was
acquired by OpenAI.
 
acquired by OpenAI.
Now, Microsoft owns a 49% stake in Open
 
Now, Microsoft owns a 49% stake in Open
A Open AI and has IP rights.
 
A Open AI and has IP rights.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Now, there's a tenuous relationship here
 
&gt;&gt; Now, there's a tenuous relationship here
right now between Open AI and Microsoft
 
right now between Open AI and Microsoft
that sets the foundation for all of the
 
that sets the foundation for all of the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's about to go down
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's about to go down
&gt;&gt; that me and Peter are going to talk
 
&gt;&gt; that me and Peter are going to talk
about,
 
about,
&gt;&gt; which is essentially uh Microsoft with
 
&gt;&gt; which is essentially uh Microsoft with
these IP rights um can essentially take
 
these IP rights um can essentially take
whatever OpenAI is developing and use
 
whatever OpenAI is developing and use
it. And so OpenAI was concerned that
 
it. And so OpenAI was concerned that
Microsoft was going to take the IP from
 
Microsoft was going to take the IP from
Windsurf and drop it into their C-pilot
 
Windsurf and drop it into their C-pilot
product.
 
product.
&gt;&gt; And this is exacerbated by there's this
 
&gt;&gt; And this is exacerbated by there's this
lawsuit going on right now. And an email
 
lawsuit going on right now. And an email
surface from from the lawsuit where the
 
surface from from the lawsuit where the
Microsoft CEO Satia Nadella said in
 
Microsoft CEO Satia Nadella said in
reference to OpenAI, we have all the IP
 
reference to OpenAI, we have all the IP
rights and capability. We have the
 
rights and capability. We have the
people, we have the compute, we have the
 
people, we have the compute, we have the
data, we have everything. We are below
 
data, we have everything. We are below
them, above them, around them.
 
them, above them, around them.
&gt;&gt; What a great partnership.
 
&gt;&gt; What a great partnership.
&gt;&gt; So that's the found. So you know, so
 
&gt;&gt; So that's the found. So you know, so
like they wanted they open wants to
 
like they wanted they open wants to
acquire Windsorf. They're like, uhoh,
 
acquire Windsorf. They're like, uhoh,
like we don't want Microsoft to have
 
like we don't want Microsoft to have
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Deal gets called off. So it
 
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Deal gets called off. So it
falls through.
 
falls through.
Then Google snaps up Windsurf for 2.4
 
Then Google snaps up Windsurf for 2.4
billion.
 
billion.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And there's essentially then on
 
&gt;&gt; Yep. And there's essentially then on
Twitter what started with a oh my god
 
Twitter what started with a oh my god
what an amazing outcome like yay like
 
what an amazing outcome like yay like
the employees are going to be like
 
the employees are going to be like
you're going to be this is amazing like
 
you're going to be this is amazing like
this is the dream.
 
this is the dream.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; We will come back to the drama then that
 
&gt;&gt; We will come back to the drama then that
happened in a second. So
 
happened in a second. So
basically all this drama breaks out. I
 
basically all this drama breaks out. I
will come back to that. But an hour ago,
 
will come back to that. But an hour ago,
Cognition
 
Cognition
also purchased Windsurf for three
 
also purchased Windsurf for three
billion.
 
billion.
So if if you're tracking at home, there
 
So if if you're tracking at home, there
are now two real deals that are on the
 
are now two real deals that are on the
table. So the Cognition deal, which is a
 
table. So the Cognition deal, which is a
$3 billion deal that includes Windsurf's
 
$3 billion deal that includes Windsurf's
IP, product, trademark, brand, and
 
IP, product, trademark, brand, and
business operations. So that means the
 
business operations. So that means the
majority of the people and the Google
 
majority of the people and the Google
deal where Google hired several of the
 
deal where Google hired several of the
key windsurf personnel including the CEO
 
key windsurf personnel including the CEO
co-founders and multiple researchers
 
co-founders and multiple researchers
from the R&amp;D team. They are all joining
 
from the R&amp;D team. They are all joining
deep mind working on agentic coding
 
deep mind working on agentic coding
initiatives specifically for Gemini and
 
initiatives specifically for Gemini and
that deal is worth 2.4 billion.
 
that deal is worth 2.4 billion.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So let's get into the drama. Okay. So
 
&gt;&gt; So let's get into the drama. Okay. So
erase the cognition deal from your head
 
erase the cognition deal from your head
for a second. over the weekend. Um,
 
for a second. over the weekend. Um,
basically what Google did is to to try
 
basically what Google did is to to try
and avoid issues uh regulatory issues
 
and avoid issues uh regulatory issues
with the acquisition.
 
with the acquisition.
They basically did an aqua hire
 
They basically did an aqua hire
situation to where they were taking the
 
situation to where they were taking the
co-founders and the researchers for 2.4
 
co-founders and the researchers for 2.4
billion and then giving the rest of the
 
billion and then giving the rest of the
company to the employees. So now it's an
 
company to the employees. So now it's an
employeeowned company. And the issue
 
employeeowned company. And the issue
with this, Peter, and this is where I
 
with this, Peter, and this is where I
want you to jump in, is that the
 
want you to jump in, is that the
founders and these researchers were
 
founders and these researchers were
going to see this massive payday from
 
going to see this massive payday from
their equity in Windsorf
 
their equity in Windsorf
and none of the employees that were
 
and none of the employees that were
staying at Windsorf, the entity, were
 
staying at Windsorf, the entity, were
going to be able to take part in that
 
going to be able to take part in that
payday. So, Peter, do I have that right?
 
payday. So, Peter, do I have that right?
Is that essentially like what we were
 
Is that essentially like what we were
talking about on Twitter this weekend?
 
talking about on Twitter this weekend?
&gt;&gt; 100%. The only nuance is vested and
 
&gt;&gt; 100%. The only nuance is vested and
unvested equity. So
 
unvested equity. So
&gt;&gt; there was uh for a while on Twitter,
 
&gt;&gt; there was uh for a while on Twitter,
which you know, shame on us uh for
 
which you know, shame on us uh for
getting too excited about incomplete
 
getting too excited about incomplete
data on Twitter, that does happen. There
 
data on Twitter, that does happen. There
was a meme going around that actually
 
was a meme going around that actually
even the vested employees that were not
 
even the vested employees that were not
making the jump from when surf to Google
 
making the jump from when surf to Google
were getting screwed. So that's not
 
were getting screwed. So that's not
true. Those people are going to get paid
 
true. Those people are going to get paid
according to their vesting. What that
 
according to their vesting. What that
leaves though, and this is gigantic
 
leaves though, and this is gigantic
because Windsurf as a product, not
 
because Windsurf as a product, not
Kodium the company, but Windinsurf as a
 
Kodium the company, but Windinsurf as a
product or excuse me, might be having
 
product or excuse me, might be having
that backwards is like a year old.
 
that backwards is like a year old.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; this is a very new flashy product that
 
&gt;&gt; this is a very new flashy product that
they're building. And the majority of
 
they're building. And the majority of
the people who work at Windsorf have
 
the people who work at Windsorf have
been there less than a year.
 
been there less than a year.
&gt;&gt; More than 50% of them have. So what does
 
&gt;&gt; More than 50% of them have. So what does
that mean? That means they were
 
that mean? That means they were
unvested. The equity did not accelerate
 
unvested. The equity did not accelerate
because this was not an acquisition. So
 
because this was not an acquisition. So
there is no acceleration clause that
 
there is no acceleration clause that
matters and so they were literally just
 
matters and so they were literally just
being left in the lurch.
 
being left in the lurch.
&gt;&gt; Y
 
&gt;&gt; Y
&gt;&gt; and look like I've you know posted about
 
&gt;&gt; and look like I've you know posted about
this like a bunch of people posted about
 
this like a bunch of people posted about
this and there were all and like most of
 
this and there were all and like most of
it was like yeah that's kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
it was like yeah that's kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
the employee should get paid out and
 
the employee should get paid out and
then there were always a couple people
 
then there were always a couple people
who were like do you even know how
 
who were like do you even know how
acquisitions work? This is always how
 
acquisitions work? This is always how
acquisitions work. Nothing is new here.
 
acquisitions work. Nothing is new here.
Like get over it. Don't cry. And it's
 
Like get over it. Don't cry. And it's
like that is just completely untrue.
 
like that is just completely untrue.
Yes, of course there have been
 
Yes, of course there have been
acquisitions where the people were not
 
acquisitions where the people were not
fully hired etc. But on the majority the
 
fully hired etc. But on the majority the
majority expectation for a deal like
 
majority expectation for a deal like
this which is gigantic $3 billion two to
 
this which is gigantic $3 billion two to
two to five to three point $3 billion.
 
two to five to three point $3 billion.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Is that the employees will get taken
 
&gt;&gt; Is that the employees will get taken
care of. It is a unwritten but
 
care of. It is a unwritten but
definitely expected rule across Silicon
 
definitely expected rule across Silicon
Valley that you are going to do your
 
Valley that you are going to do your
best to have the entire employee base be
 
best to have the entire employee base be
taken care of and that includes
 
taken care of and that includes
acceleration. And if it doesn't include
 
acceleration. And if it doesn't include
acceleration, guess what? If you got
 
acceleration, guess what? If you got
bought by Google, then you get Google
 
bought by Google, then you get Google
stock instead. That's valuable stuff.
 
stock instead. That's valuable stuff.
So, like I just don't I hate I I'll say
 
So, like I just don't I hate I I'll say
this maybe more strongly. I absolutely
 
this maybe more strongly. I absolutely
hate the idea that everyone's like, "Eh,
 
hate the idea that everyone's like, "Eh,
whatever. they weren't going to get paid
 
whatever. they weren't going to get paid
out anyways. This is kind of just how
 
out anyways. This is kind of just how
the world works. It's not really the
 
the world works. It's not really the
expectation. And I think it really does
 
expectation. And I think it really does
change something fundamental about what
 
change something fundamental about what
joining a startup is about.
 
joining a startup is about.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Yep. Exactly. I you just you
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Yep. Exactly. I you just you
hit the nail on the head. What I will
 
hit the nail on the head. What I will
add to it is
 
add to it is
this. You know what what Peter's saying
 
this. You know what what Peter's saying
is when a deal happens of this
 
is when a deal happens of this
magnitude, of this speed and velocity
 
magnitude, of this speed and velocity
with this level of success,
 
with this level of success,
every other time employees have been
 
every other time employees have been
taken care of.
 
taken care of.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, you know, those those
 
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, you know, those those
haters on Twitter who are like, "Oh,
 
haters on Twitter who are like, "Oh,
like you don't know how deals work."
 
like you don't know how deals work."
Really, what they're talking about here
 
Really, what they're talking about here
is like when deals are um when the the
 
is like when deals are um when the the
seller doesn't have any power. That's
 
seller doesn't have any power. That's
not the case we have here, right? the
 
not the case we have here, right? the
seller had tons of power, right? That's
 
seller had tons of power, right? That's
why they're selling for so much so
 
why they're selling for so much so
quickly.
 
quickly.
&gt;&gt; And so, for sure, there are deals that
 
&gt;&gt; And so, for sure, there are deals that
happen to where it's like, yeah, like we
 
happen to where it's like, yeah, like we
acquired, you know, it was an acquis it
 
acquired, you know, it was an acquis it
was an aqua hire, you know, like the the
 
was an aqua hire, you know, like the the
investors maybe get 1x, maybe they get
 
investors maybe get 1x, maybe they get
less than 1x and so the employees don't
 
less than 1x and so the employees don't
get anything. Yeah.
 
get anything. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like everybody understands those deals.
 
&gt;&gt; Like everybody understands those deals.
That's not what happened here. The
 
That's not what happened here. The
investors are making a boatload of
 
investors are making a boatload of
money. Do you know Peter what the the
 
money. Do you know Peter what the the
last uh the last valuation was?
 
last uh the last valuation was?
&gt;&gt; I don't I I mean I've read a couple
 
&gt;&gt; I don't I I mean I've read a couple
places that many of the investors are
 
places that many of the investors are
making 3 to 4x their cash. So yeah
 
making 3 to 4x their cash. So yeah
that's the case you know Verun the execs
 
that's the case you know Verun the execs
and the you know select engineers that
 
and the you know select engineers that
are going over to Google are making buku
 
are going over to Google are making buku
money and are set. So that leaves this
 
money and are set. So that leaves this
employee base that thankfully we can
 
employee base that thankfully we can
&gt;&gt; I actually want to leave the cognition
 
&gt;&gt; I actually want to leave the cognition
deal to one side even longer because
 
deal to one side even longer because
that's sort of a white savior night
 
that's sort of a white savior night
situation where cognition just came in
 
situation where cognition just came in
and made this whole but it doesn't get
 
and made this whole but it doesn't get
rid of the problem because this will now
 
rid of the problem because this will now
a I mean look at scale inflection
 
a I mean look at scale inflection
character AI this is now a theme across
 
character AI this is now a theme across
venture that means it's going to keep
 
venture that means it's going to keep
happening and not every one of these
 
happening and not every one of these
deals is going to have a cognition to
 
deals is going to have a cognition to
ride in and make everybody whole. And so
 
ride in and make everybody whole. And so
it really does change the calculus of
 
it really does change the calculus of
joining a startup that is this rocket
 
joining a startup that is this rocket
ship because now not only do you have to
 
ship because now not only do you have to
worry about what your equity is worth,
 
worry about what your equity is worth,
you have to be worried about whether or
 
you have to be worried about whether or
not you qualify into some super select
 
not you qualify into some super select
group that gets to continue doing this
 
group that gets to continue doing this
or like it. They basically just put a
 
or like it. They basically just put a
scarlet letter on everyone who was at
 
scarlet letter on everyone who was at
Windsurf who didn't make it to Google
 
Windsurf who didn't make it to Google
and they were like I mean you clearly
 
and they were like I mean you clearly
weren't some of the best employees we
 
weren't some of the best employees we
had so good luck with the rest of this
 
had so good luck with the rest of this
company you know. Yeah.
 
company you know. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I just don't look I I really dislike
 
&gt;&gt; I just don't look I I really dislike
that as a move from a founder.
 
that as a move from a founder.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's talk about like why are
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's talk about like why are
these deals being structured the way
 
these deals being structured the way
that they are just for a beat so people
 
that they are just for a beat so people
understand this. So, uh, under the last
 
understand this. So, uh, under the last
administration, Lena Khan ran the was
 
administration, Lena Khan ran the was
the FTC.
 
the FTC.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And she essentially stopped all
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And she essentially stopped all
acquisitions in tech. Like for for
 
acquisitions in tech. Like for for
better or worse, like that's what
 
better or worse, like that's what
happened.
 
happened.
&gt;&gt; No, there all big acquisitions. There
 
&gt;&gt; No, there all big acquisitions. There
were still a lot of smaller deals going
 
were still a lot of smaller deals going
on.
 
on.
&gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. All big acquisitions,
 
&gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. All big acquisitions,
especially from big tech acquiring
 
especially from big tech acquiring
anything else.
 
anything else.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, every one of those deals had
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, every one of those deals had
significant regulatory scrutiny.
 
significant regulatory scrutiny.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And so what ended up happening was there
 
&gt;&gt; And so what ended up happening was there
was a a grinding of the gears and none
 
was a a grinding of the gears and none
of these deals happened until one of
 
of these deals happened until one of
these deals, I believe Character was
 
these deals, I believe Character was
like one of the first ones. Yes.
 
like one of the first ones. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Uh was structured in this way to where
 
&gt;&gt; Uh was structured in this way to where
it's essentially like, well, we're just
 
it's essentially like, well, we're just
acquiring the founders and the
 
acquiring the founders and the
researchers, you know, aka the most
 
researchers, you know, aka the most
important people.
 
important people.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
you keep the company employees, keep
 
you keep the company employees, keep
running that thing, right? We're just
 
running that thing, right? We're just
going to take what we want here. So, the
 
going to take what we want here. So, the
founders are gone. Y
 
founders are gone. Y
&gt;&gt; they're no longer involved in the
 
&gt;&gt; they're no longer involved in the
company. And you know, we had um we had
 
company. And you know, we had um we had
Annie on the show who's the chief people
 
Annie on the show who's the chief people
officer at Character and she talked
 
officer at Character and she talked
about this openly. It's it's such a
 
about this openly. It's it's such a
strange dynamic. I even in the
 
strange dynamic. I even in the
conversation I was like I don't even
 
conversation I was like I don't even
know how deep I should go with her
 
know how deep I should go with her
because

was it was stunning to everybody but now
like we are leaning into this and you
 
like we are leaning into this and you
know this is the new world we still have
 
know this is the new world we still have
a product like we still have the same
 
a product like we still have the same
mission we just don't have the founders
 
mission we just don't have the founders
anymore.
 
anymore.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you know to her credit right like as

&gt;&gt; Totally.
&gt;&gt; You know after this is over. Totally.
 
&gt;&gt; You know after this is over. Totally.
&gt;&gt; So anyways all that to say that deal
 
&gt;&gt; So anyways all that to say that deal
happens right employees get taken care
 
happens right employees get taken care
of still in those deals. Now we're
 
of still in those deals. Now we're
starting to see, this is the first time
 
starting to see, this is the first time
we're starting to see to potentially a
 
we're starting to see to potentially a
deal structure and terms to get a deal
 
deal structure and terms to get a deal
through, right, to where it doesn't have
 
through, right, to where it doesn't have
regulatory scrutiny that they're like,
 
regulatory scrutiny that they're like,
"Oh, like you know, these other
 
"Oh, like you know, these other
employees we don't really give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
employees we don't really give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
about."
 
about."
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And for me, Peter, this is actually I
 
&gt;&gt; And for me, Peter, this is actually I
think it's I I describe it as revealed
 
think it's I I describe it as revealed
behavior.
 
behavior.
&gt;&gt; So you and I, right, we're we're players
 
&gt;&gt; So you and I, right, we're we're players
in the game. We deeply understand the
 
in the game. We deeply understand the
game. We appreciate that. Like, you
 
game. We appreciate that. Like, you
know, working at Carta too, right? It's

the thing because that's how you acrew
the most value.
 
the most value.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; But ultimately like these other actors
 
&gt;&gt; But ultimately like these other actors
specifically like some of these like

careful here and say there's a
possibility that this was all one deal
 
possibility that this was all one deal
and it was always going to work out this

is if you've separated the acquisition

what you're saying there, but like I
 
what you're saying there, but like I

&gt;&gt; it's not like an or thing for me, but
like I do love that. Like, I think that
 
like I do love that. Like, I think that
that's actually a great thing. Like,
 
that's actually a great thing. Like,
it's always kind of been this way. the
 
it's always kind of been this way. the
top like 20 to 50 people at a company
 
top like 20 to 50 people at a company
are generally the ones that are like,
 
are generally the ones that are like,
you know, creating the the majority of
 
you know, creating the the majority of
the value. So, I I have nothing against
 
the value. So, I I have nothing against
the people who made out like bandits
 
the people who made out like bandits
here. Not at all. I think that's great.
 
here. Not at all. I think that's great.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; For me, it's everyone else and and how
 
&gt;&gt; For me, it's everyone else and and how
we think about them as part of the
 
we think about them as part of the
ecosystem.
 
ecosystem.
And this is where I will tell you I feel
 
And this is where I will tell you I feel
like the era of AI, you you're just
 
like the era of AI, you you're just
you're seeing you could see people how
 
you're seeing you could see people how
they talk about it. like they don't give

don't care
&gt;&gt; they feel like you are replaceable
 
&gt;&gt; they feel like you are replaceable
and the only positive thing from this is
 
and the only positive thing from this is
that finally we have seen deal terms say
 
that finally we have seen deal terms say
it out loud again we believe this is
 
it out loud again we believe this is
true right it's it's July 14th maybe it
 
true right it's it's July 14th maybe it
turns out mean
 
turns out mean
&gt;&gt; Pacific
 
&gt;&gt; Pacific
&gt;&gt; yeah maybe we're wrong. But I The reason
 
&gt;&gt; yeah maybe we're wrong. But I The reason
why everyone's worked up about this is
 
why everyone's worked up about this is
because
 
because
logically I can see where they're coming
 
logically I can see where they're coming
from. I don't agree with it.
 
from. I don't agree with it.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; But I can see where they're and that's
 
&gt;&gt; But I can see where they're and that's
why everyone is riled up about it
 
why everyone is riled up about it
because it's wrong.
 
because it's wrong.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; It is wrong.
 
&gt;&gt; It is wrong.
&gt;&gt; It it is. And it again, this is where I
 
&gt;&gt; It it is. And it again, this is where I
can hear the comments being like, "Well,
 
can hear the comments being like, "Well,
it's not new." And you're like, "Well,
 
it's not new." And you're like, "Well,
okay, in the specifics, maybe it isn't
 
okay, in the specifics, maybe it isn't
new. There were deals in which employees
 
new. There were deals in which employees
got screwed before, but AI has
 
got screwed before, but AI has
introduced this new dynamic and again I
 
introduced this new dynamic and again I
love the way you put it when you're
 
love the way you put it when you're
talking about the way people talk about
 
talking about the way people talk about
these jobs where you've removed the
 
these jobs where you've removed the
value from the people and you're just
 
value from the people and you're just
saying like this is something that we
 
saying like this is something that we
see with startup founders all the time
 
see with startup founders all the time
right now in our data which is we want
 
right now in our data which is we want
to keep the team as small as possible.

The goal is never to hire again. The

on the margin. That makes total sense
 
on the margin. That makes total sense
for every individual company on the

people go? What jobs do they have?
 
people go? What jobs do they have?
&gt;&gt; I am
 
&gt;&gt; I am
&gt;&gt; I I'm like really fairly
 
&gt;&gt; I I'm like really fairly
uncertain about the people who say that
 
uncertain about the people who say that
AI is not taking any jobs. It's like
 
AI is not taking any jobs. It's like
where have you been the last
 
where have you been the last
&gt;&gt; I agree totally. Exactly.
 
&gt;&gt; I agree totally. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; This is an absolute silly conversation.
 
&gt;&gt; This is an absolute silly conversation.
Of course it is taking jobs. Y
 
Of course it is taking jobs. Y
&gt;&gt; maybe it is. Maybe you're not getting
 
&gt;&gt; maybe it is. Maybe you're not getting
laid off because of AI, but you're not
 
laid off because of AI, but you're not
getting hired because of it. So like I I
 
getting hired because of it. So like I I
just I feel like it's a the reason why
 
just I feel like it's a the reason why
this one versus scale or character the
 
this one versus scale or character the
other ones blew up is because one I
 
other ones blew up is because one I
think it looked worse at the surface and
 
think it looked worse at the surface and
the communication was much worse. And
 
the communication was much worse. And
the second is because I think people are
 
the second is because I think people are
looking around in context with those

&gt;&gt; I heard him speak one time and I might
 
&gt;&gt; I heard him speak one time and I might
get the number wrong but the the essence

early employees into millionaires.
 
early employees into millionaires.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
And what you're seeing here now is
 
And what you're seeing here now is
essentially people like you know the CEO
 
essentially people like you know the CEO
of SSRF again with what the data we know
 
of SSRF again with what the data we know
basically saying I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
basically saying I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

They weren't the the researchers who
 
They weren't the the researchers who
came up with this novel way of doing it.
 
came up with this novel way of doing it.
Um and so like yeah like you know they
 
Um and so like yeah like you know they
were essentially cogs in the wheel which
 
were essentially cogs in the wheel which
is how a lot of employees have felt for
 
is how a lot of employees have felt for
the last 15 years 20 years. And now it's
 
the last 15 years 20 years. And now it's
like actually like working its way
 
like actually like working its way
through the system into the outcomes.
 
through the system into the outcomes.
So you're exactly right Peter that if
 
So you're exactly right Peter that if
you are evaluating now working at a
 
you are evaluating now working at a
startup. So this is what I'm going to
 
startup. So this is what I'm going to
talk about next is like what what comes
 
talk about next is like what what comes
next
 
next
&gt;&gt; and how do we think about this moving
 
&gt;&gt; and how do we think about this moving
forward and you are you and I are the we
 
forward and you are you and I are the we
are not researchers.
 
are not researchers.
&gt;&gt; It's true 100%.

that you could do on so I mean basic
 
that you could do on so I mean basic
structure here it comes down to your

trigger uh liquidation which is a single
 
trigger uh liquidation which is a single
trigger is just if the company gets
 
trigger is just if the company gets
bought all invested equity is
 
bought all invested equity is
accelerated. A double trigger is if the
 
accelerated. A double trigger is if the
company is purchased and you are laid
 
company is purchased and you are laid
off in the first six months of that
 
off in the first six months of that
purchase then your equity your unvested
 
purchase then your equity your unvested
equity accelerates.
 
equity accelerates.
I would be very interested to watch
 
I would be very interested to watch
whether or not those terms start to
 
whether or not those terms start to
change
 
change
&gt;&gt; first and foremost more single rather
 
&gt;&gt; first and foremost more single rather
than double
 
than double
&gt;&gt; and then beyond that what counts as an
 
&gt;&gt; and then beyond that what counts as an
acquisition what counts as like a
 
acquisition what counts as like a
qualifying change of control because
 
qualifying change of control because
none of these would have qualified under
 
none of these would have qualified under
the current definitions nobody is
 
the current definitions nobody is
getting acquired it's licensing
 
getting acquired it's licensing
agreements or a 49% stake
 
agreements or a 49% stake
&gt;&gt; so it's it's a very like on the equity
 
&gt;&gt; so it's it's a very like on the equity
side I actually think that we need to
 
side I actually think that we need to
watch out to see if there's
 
watch out to see if there's
equity clauses that become much more
 
equity clauses that become much more
common as top talent sort of demands
 
common as top talent sort of demands
them in these deals.
 
them in these deals.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's essentially basically what
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's essentially basically what
you're talking about is democratizing
 
you're talking about is democratizing
what has been true for execs.
 
what has been true for execs.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
 
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; For a long time, right? Execs negotiate
 
&gt;&gt; For a long time, right? Execs negotiate
these things.
 
these things.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Um into the rest of the employee
 
&gt;&gt; Um into the rest of the employee
population. You know, I have a slightly
 
population. You know, I have a slightly
different take,
 
different take,
&gt;&gt; which is
 
&gt;&gt; which is
I feel like this presents an opportunity
 
I feel like this presents an opportunity
for founders who do believe in the
 
for founders who do believe in the
social contract
 
social contract
to actually
 
to actually
like they want to get ahead of it. And
 
like they want to get ahead of it. And
so if it was me, what I would do is I
 
so if it was me, what I would do is I
would actually say
 
would actually say
&gt;&gt; uh you know there's all these models
 
&gt;&gt; uh you know there's all these models
that happen. You talked about the the
 
that happen. You talked about the the
liquidation preference stack. And so
 
liquidation preference stack. And so
what that means for people is like uh
 
what that means for people is like uh
you know if investors um investors can
 
you know if investors um investors can
block deals if it's not a certain amount
 
block deals if it's not a certain amount
bigger than the round that they invested
 
bigger than the round that they invested
in right they can they have all these
 
in right they can they have all these
different rights um that they can invoke
 
different rights um that they can invoke
&gt;&gt; and I think for really hot companies
 
&gt;&gt; and I think for really hot companies
founders what they should do is actually
 
founders what they should do is actually
premeditate this for the employees and
 
premeditate this for the employees and
so saying like hey investors guess what
 
so saying like hey investors guess what
we're going to do for our employee base
 
we're going to do for our employee base
because it's going to help us recruit
 
because it's going to help us recruit
We're going to actually give everybody a
 
We're going to actually give everybody a
double trigger. We're going to actually
 
double trigger. We're going to actually
give everybody a single trigger if we
 
give everybody a single trigger if we
hit this share price in an IPO or an M&amp;A
 
hit this share price in an IPO or an M&amp;A
event.
 
event.
&gt;&gt; And so I actually think you could start
 
&gt;&gt; And so I actually think you could start
to see it coming from the company side
 
to see it coming from the company side
to be able to compete for the talent.
 
to be able to compete for the talent.
The problem is with that idea is that
 
The problem is with that idea is that
the power just unfortunately is not with
 
the power just unfortunately is not with
the rank and file.
 
the rank and file.
&gt;&gt; The power is with the researchers.
 
&gt;&gt; The power is with the researchers.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's the thing is we can I
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's the thing is we can I
could speculate about five or six
 
could speculate about five or six
different changes that you could make to
 
different changes that you could make to
a standard option agreement or RSU
 
a standard option agreement or RSU
agreement that would make it more
 
agreement that would make it more
employee friendly. The problem is what
 
employee friendly. The problem is what
incentive does the company have to do
 
incentive does the company have to do
that when as we've seen from our data
 
that when as we've seen from our data
fewer and fewer employees are getting
 
fewer and fewer employees are getting
hired.
 
hired.
&gt;&gt; That's the thing.
 
&gt;&gt; That's the thing.
&gt;&gt; Where does the leverage exist? Like if
 
&gt;&gt; Where does the leverage exist? Like if
you come in and you're not a hot shot
 
you come in and you're not a hot shot
researcher, if you are Peter and you
 
researcher, if you are Peter and you
want to run an insights team somewhere,
 
want to run an insights team somewhere,
does do I have the leverage point to
 
does do I have the leverage point to
push back on standard equity terms at
 
push back on standard equity terms at
the company? I don't know. And I I don't
 
the company? I don't know. And I I don't
know why a lot of these companies who
 
know why a lot of these companies who
are flooded with applications right now,
 
are flooded with applications right now,
there is there's a ton of great talent
 
there is there's a ton of great talent
on the market. Why would they make
 
on the market. Why would they make
exceptions here? Now, some of them will
 
exceptions here? Now, some of them will
do so because this is part of the core
 
do so because this is part of the core
founder ethos and that's what they want
 
founder ethos and that's what they want
to show, which I absolutely respect and
 
to show, which I absolutely respect and
love. Um, it's kind of like the idea of
 
love. Um, it's kind of like the idea of
giving more people time to exercise
 
giving more people time to exercise
after they've been terminated. Some
 
after they've been terminated. Some
founders do it and they make a point of
 
founders do it and they make a point of
it. A lot of founders don't do it
 
it. A lot of founders don't do it
because the market doesn't force them
 
because the market doesn't force them
to. I think this is going to be the same
 
to. I think this is going to be the same
thing.
 
thing.
&gt;&gt; Yep. I agree. I the only advice I have
 
&gt;&gt; Yep. I agree. I the only advice I have
for people is you need to you need to
 
for people is you need to you need to
become AI native and you need to invest
 
become AI native and you need to invest
in yourself. And it it sounds like a
 
in yourself. And it it sounds like a
little fluffy, but specifically like you
 
little fluffy, but specifically like you
know, Peter, one of the things I've been
 
know, Peter, one of the things I've been
watching you do for the last couple of
 
watching you do for the last couple of
years
 
years
&gt;&gt; is like your LinkedIn following is mega,
 
&gt;&gt; is like your LinkedIn following is mega,
right? Like what are you what are you at
 
right? Like what are you what are you at
now? You're got to be over 100,000.
 
now? You're got to be over 100,000.
&gt;&gt; Uhund 140 I think.
 
&gt;&gt; Uhund 140 I think.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And so if Carter decides like,
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And so if Carter decides like,
"Oh, AI researcher is bigger than
 
"Oh, AI researcher is bigger than
Peter."
 
Peter."
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Well, guess what comes with Peter?
 
&gt;&gt; Well, guess what comes with Peter?
Whoever hires you is that 140,000 person
 
Whoever hires you is that 140,000 person
audience.
 
audience.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And these are the things that I think
 
&gt;&gt; And these are the things that I think
people got to start thinking about what
 
people got to start thinking about what
they can take with them from company to
 
they can take with them from company to
company. Right. For us, it's our brand.
 
company. Right. For us, it's our brand.
Like that's what you and I have been
 
Like that's what you and I have been
pretty good at. For other people, it can
 
pretty good at. For other people, it can
be like, you know, like researchers are,
 
be like, you know, like researchers are,
you know, they're they're building these
 
you know, they're they're building these
frontier LLMs. Y
 
frontier LLMs. Y
&gt;&gt; I think everybody's got to get clear on
 
&gt;&gt; I think everybody's got to get clear on
this in this era of displacement
 
this in this era of displacement
&gt;&gt; because you you said it right. Carter
 
&gt;&gt; because you you said it right. Carter
data is showing
 
data is showing
&gt;&gt; there's less hiring going on.
 
&gt;&gt; there's less hiring going on.
&gt;&gt; If you think of this like
 
&gt;&gt; If you think of this like
&gt;&gt; a sports league, I think it is I know
 
&gt;&gt; a sports league, I think it is I know
the TBPN like somebody so and so got
 
the TBPN like somebody so and so got
traded. Things are funny and they are
 
traded. Things are funny and they are
funny, but it really does boil down to
 
funny, but it really does boil down to
that where it's not because you worked
 
that where it's not because you worked
at the Los Angeles Lakers that you will
 
at the Los Angeles Lakers that you will
get a job at the Detroit Pistons. is
 
get a job at the Detroit Pistons. is
because you can fill a role and you're a
 
because you can fill a role and you're a
 
basketball and literally it's about your
 
basketball and literally it's about your
skill set and you individually. It just
 
skill set and you individually. It just
becomes a more atomized ecosystem and I
 
becomes a more atomized ecosystem and I
can mourn for that as much as I as much
 
can mourn for that as much as I as much
as I want to which I am like I
 
as I want to which I am like I
&gt;&gt; I do think that like starting at a small
 
&gt;&gt; I do think that like starting at a small
company as an early employee as a
 
company as an early employee as a
generalist is an awesome way to build
 
generalist is an awesome way to build
your life. You learn so much and I just
 
your life. You learn so much and I just
hope that there's still room for that.
 
hope that there's still room for that.
But in general I think your points are
 
But in general I think your points are
really really well made. You have to
 
really really well made. You have to
take control of what you offer on the
 
take control of what you offer on the
table. And sadly, you might expect less
 
table. And sadly, you might expect less
from execs or company management in
 
from execs or company management in
terms of how much they are going to care
 
terms of how much they are going to care
about you when the chips are down.
 
about you when the chips are down.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. It's a it's a sad and I think
 
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. It's a it's a sad and I think
an and oftentimes ugly state of reality
 
an and oftentimes ugly state of reality
that we're looking at. We're looking for
 
that we're looking at. We're looking for
good actors. And so I think the other
 
good actors. And so I think the other
thing we're going to see is like when
 
thing we're going to see is like when
when good actors
 
when good actors
do good things, they're going to be
 
do good things, they're going to be
praised very widely, especially on
 
praised very widely, especially on
social media. So yeah, we're in a we're
 
social media. So yeah, we're in a we're
