hey everybody welcome to another session
of the fabulous HR Heretics we are here
today with another pendo friend Trisha
price peno's Chief product officer I'm
so excited to have her here I worked
with her for three years pendo and
Trisha today clearly I've dusted off my
pink sweater this is rare but it's here
I mean it's like a crew neck with the
whole thing you know it has a little bit
of like Elizabeth Holmes Vibes it does
like with the the turtleneck thing yeah
for those of you who instead of black
turtleneck she's going turtleneck for
those of you who only listen and don't
watch today might be a good time to
check out the YouTube all I need is a
brooch and we're good to go but Trisha's
awesome we've again we've been working
together for years excited to have her
on previous stendo she was at enino as
their product officer Innovation officer
for about six years she's sits on boards
before that she was in sales and go to
market and products at promatics
Financial she is from Virginia resides
in North Carolina and we are excited to
get into it with you today I'm excited
to be here thanks for having me all
right so just to jump in we like to you
know get into the meat here and the
zingers right away and I just want to I
got to dig into the dynamics of being a
Chief Products officer working for a
Founder CEO that's a product Guru I mean
that is like me starting my own company
and then hiring a people officer it's a
dynamic it's a Vibe and it's not easy
and Todd's been on the show as you know
very intense lots of strong opinions and
let's talk about it let's talk about how
you're how you deal with that and how
you dealt with that especially on
boarding through today three years later
you're still here still here you know it
is a special Dynamic and you missed one
more piece of the puzzle like founder
CEO product Guru product person and
pendo sells two product people as our
buyer so there's like even sort of a
third Dynamic also a fourth Dynamic
which is one of the other Founders is on
our product leadership team as well so
there is definitely a lot there and I
think if you if you can figure out how
to build trust how to build
relationships and how to utilize
Founders the right way it can be an
incredibly special tool or gift at the
same time you have to figure out how to
set
boundaries and how to be a tough cookie
in certain situations to not get run
over so it's been good and bad for me
I've seen this relationship actually
work out terribly in the past and it's
actually at that company I still don't
think it's working out great but like
how you know one of the examples was the
founder was like showing up to product
reviews and you know still pinging
Engineers on a daily basis and still
very much in the minutia which is how
they got to be so good usually how did
you solve that problem well in the very
beginning we did have some ground rules
I asked for some space for a period of
time where Todd would not interact with
anyone other than one level below me and
even that we would talk about what those
meetings were going to be they wouldn't
be secret they wouldn't be in private or
sort of behind my back they would be
something we both talked about and
aligned on what the purpose was in
discussions but I did ask for him not to
come to any product reviews or get in
the details with individual contributors
I'm going to say three or four months
that I asked for I I knew that couldn't
be too long Nolan because that's not
fair to Todd either to just give me
blank trust and say go mess everything
up right so but I also needed a little
time to get my arms around everything
and if he was in there directing it's
like as soon as you try to make progress
and get your hands around things they
change and so we did have that Mutual
understanding he actually still does not
come to my product reviews unless we ask
him to and sometimes we do or but we do
have a quarterly sort of more qbr style
type meeting where he can engage at a
little bit higher of an altitude and
then we also if we're building a brand
new product and tau is so good when
you're thinking about building a brand
new product and the user experience we
will absolutely have brainstorm sessions
with Todd and pick his brain and use his
magic to help Drive The Experience of
the product yeah you got to like Channel
like the genius and use that in the
selective right cases versus you know
like always like the involvement because
otherwise it just feels like Dad is
there all the time and then you it kind
of handicaps you and and stops you from
being able to do a good job it does
Nolan and I find that specifically to
Todd utilizing him in a brainstorm
session is just magical and the way he
can operate with me or even if I'm not
there with the individual contributors
even is really great that's wildly
different than putting him in the middle
of a product review where you're more in
a position of leadership and
decisionmaking and that needs to be my
space yep and Founders love to be
involved I mean it it is impossible to
like give them the hand and say stay out
because they will you know what I mean
they're like they'll find their way in
like a rodent Todd said it on the show
like Todd when we were talking about you
know execs that are going to do well
versus not like one of his early red
flags is when they just go off on an
island come do a thing and he's not
brought along that's actually like one
of his big red flags yes it is well
that's a really good point noan because
we talked about meetings and him coming
to product reviews and brainstorms but
even when he wasn't coming to product
reviews I wasn't all out there making
decisions on a daily basis and not
talking to him about it he was advising
he was influ in we were collaborating on
those decisions it's just I needed a
little space in some of those meetings
to be the leader but that doesn't mean
like I wasn't appreciating or asking his
opinion I mean he's started the company
knows every in and out about it why
wouldn't I want that guidance I just
want to double click really quick
because if I'm in the audience I might
be saying that's really wonderful that
you were able to set ground wolves with
your very passionate founder CEO and he
agreed to leave you alone that is not
normal or the norm and like how did you
do that in a way where he agreed and did
he push back at all and what advice do
you have for
others to ask for that because I don't
think a lot of people ask for that and
if they do they might get met with the
bird I think a few things one it was
something we aligned on before I started
but it wasn't in the offer letter
because I wrote that which yeah exactly
okay okay in the paragraph 2B I think I
think the other piece of the puzzle and
we can talk about this in a bit is Todd
and I spent pendo and I spent a lot of
time getting to know each other before I
started it was at least a 9mon maybe a
yearlong sort of dating scenario before
I came to pendo and so there was a trust
built already we had a lot of common
people we knew and so I do think I came
in from a place of trust I do think I
came in with a clear expect a that I
needed room to operate but I would do so
collaboratively and yeah we did have
disagreements for sure and we still do
and I think that might be the most
magical part of how it's worked and our
relationship is I will get mad and he
will know that and he'll on his walk
home from work give me a call and say
like hey how would you like for me to sh
up for that meeting differently or I'll
call him and say really wish you could
have handled that a different way with
me next time and I think we don't let
that frustration build up the way it can
sometimes at work and I think that's
another big piece of how um we've
sustained yeah there is a piece that
like he's kind of a normal human like
I've experienced like Todd a couple
times I'm like this guy's kind of dope
um so you can't like think about him as
like how most Founders operate
especially with like the festering thing
I feel like most founders let a lot of
things fester and then it like boils
over but the thing that you said which I
think is very contrarian is this like N9
month to onee recruiting
process I remember being at Google and
talking a lot about the executive
candidate experience and they had to
meet like 10 people and thinking at the
time like well yeah like of course like
this shouldn't be like an expedited
process like this is like one of the
most important hires like we're ever
making and oh by the way for them
like they want to know where the bodies
are buried and they want to know what
they're walking into and how they could
possibly be successful and you know we
just had we just had Andy price on the
show who was saying that you need to
soak with the company that's how
recruiters gets I actually think like
candidates need to do that too so can
you elaborate more on what that process
was like sure you know first I do want
to say absolutely for my sake too not
just theirs like it's like getting
married it is right I mean is a little
bit easier to leave a tech company than
it is your spouse but like it is a
complicated process and I think you do
need to spend a lot of time into it for
me my experience I mean Kelly was our
chief people officer and we built an
incredible relationship through that
process as I did with Todd as I did with
Eric trone our founder CTO as well but
for me what happened was there was an
exec who had been at Salesforce my last
company in Ceno was was built on top of
the app Exchange in partnership with
Salesforce and so I was very close with
several of the senior Executives
especially on the product side at
Salesforce and I think Kelly or pendo
had reached out to to my friend Mike
makuchi and Mike said the timing wasn't
right for him or whatever but he and
Todd knew each other and he said I don't
know if you know this but there's a
really great Chief product officer in
North Carolina literally in your
backyard you should get to know Trisha
and I had already been at enino for
almost six years five plus years at the
time and so via Mike Kelly Todd and I
got connected and
Todd you know reached out and I said hey
I might be interested one day in pendo
but I'm nine months to a year away from
making a move I had just expressed to
enino that you know it might be time for
me to move on in a year or six months
and like time for me to start thinking
about and US succession planning which
we were starting the process of and so
Todd said great fine let's meet anyway
funny enough I went to dinner with my
husband and almost forgot I had the
meeting with Todd on the calendar this
is how much I wasn't looking and I was
like oh my God I got to get home so you
know glass of wine in a first discussion
later because I had forgotten about it
we really enjoyed each other and then he
said you know meet Kelly and then you
know I said the same thing I love this
this is so cool especially the fact that
I'm in North Carolina it's in North
Carolina I love that it's product for
product and a more technical product
which I was very excited about but I
need time right we had just gone public
from Ino you've got to make sure you do
all the right things from a transition
perspective and I was very thoughtful of
that so then Todd said okay well next
time I come to my beach house because he
has a beach house somewhat near where I
live let's get together so then we had
coffee and it was just like he's like
okay well just meet a couple more people
just meet a couple more people and I did
and I kept saying the same thing and
it's funny it was like 9 months to the
day when I started at pendo from that
first discussion and he had said I
cannot wait nine months but we did and
it was great because we did have that
time to all get to know each other
that's so good it feels like a very
organic process I've actually found it's
really hard to assess product leaders
for their talent I still to this day I
struggle with this of like what does a
good product leader look like and how do
you go about assessing it and so what's
your take on can I ask you before Trisha
why have you had issues assessing
product leaders specifically Nolan like
what is it I'm just curious yeah I just
I find that like you know ultimately the
success of a product leader is how good
is the product and how good is the
business model and so a lot of times
it's well they just joined a company
that had a great product and a great
business model and so what the hell did
they actually do here versus like you
know building something from scratch or
like cu like I'm in more zero to one
mode you guys are in one to end mode and
so I just I don't even know how to think
about it so can you educate me on how
you think about that well I love that
clarification because I do think it is
different what's a great product leader
from zero to one and one to n and I am
noan more of a scaler I am more of a
product leader that's one to n than I am
zero to
one for me at the highest level my job
is to hire great people my job is to set
a high bar cheer really loud when we
reach the bar you know pick us up when
we don't brush us off keep moving making
that that entails having the right
Talent having the right Vision playing
with new technology like AI Etc and it
requires making hard prioritization
decisions knowing what to say no to you
also really really understanding the
company strategy and tying the company
strategy to the product decisions you
can't just build features like good
product leaders Drive business outcomes
and we understand what the business
outcomes are I'm a business person first
and product execution is how we achieve
the outcome and so for me that is
especially if you're talking about one
to n what is a great product
leader hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
por and check out metaview head over to

[Music]
yeah and especially at a company like
pendo where the ICP is product leaders
and you have three four Founders in
there at some point having all opinions
and everyone has a opinion on the
product because that's the passion of
the company and the you know who we sell
to who you sell to how do you deal with
that H how do you manage the Strategic
part of it versus being in the weeds and
all the little things you have to do how
do you any advice or things you put in
place to seem open or be not seem be
open and take in ideas but also stay
sane and you know have a boundary well
first of all a good product leader
spends a lot of time with customers and
Prospects you have to and that's 50%
evangelizing because big especially if
you're in B2B let me be clear if you're
in B2B your customers are putting their
neck on the line in their career on the
line buying your product and they have
to build from a place of trust and a
place of trust can come because they
tried out your product because they've
used it before because their best friend
uses it but it can also come from
building a relationship with people and
knowing that you're going to be a
company a team a person who's going to
be there and respond when things go
wrong whether that's a bug or
performance problem or a feature missing
and so that building relationship
building trust evangelizing is an
important part of my job but equally it
is to build the relationships to ask
people what are their biggest challenges
what are the outcomes they're trying to
achieve what are the challenges and then
aligning our investment strategy and
road map to what those challenges are
and so that is for me a key piece of the
puzzle is that time with one-on-one with
customers and prospects for sure yeah
how do you how do you think about the
tension between like sales and product I
you know I've been a part of companies
that you know sales is always like well
we just if we just had this one feature
right Trisha like come on like what like
what's taking so long for you guys to
build this thing and then it's like it's
literally like a NeverEnding feature
list that they will always come up with
we need more to
sell yeah exactly exactly how do you
think about like that tension and
specifically the input from go to market
I think especially at pendo I'm really
fortunate to have good relationships
with the go Tok Market
team also they sell to products so they
need us and they depend on us because we
have very strong relationships like it's
more than just product to your normal
ICP or your buyer it's product to
product spending that relationship and
so they probably need us really badly so
that's part of why the relationship like
pissing us off is probably not the best
option out there but because we're the
ones speaking at all the product
conferences right all those things so
that doesn't happen as much also I think
because Todd is such a product person he
really does not let that happen and the
product is his baby and he built you
know the ver first versions of it for
sure so there's probably a little bit of
buffer or something there because of of
Todd's love of our product and belief in
our product but I also think we execute
I mean of course I'm biased to my team
but our last two pendemonium are user
conference if you came to them I mean
there's so much Innovation customers
like they can barely keep up our
customer success team will tell me they
can barely keep up we are fighting the
sales enablement calendar to get all of
the product into sales enablement and
train so it'd be pretty tough for sales
I think to tell us that we're sort of
the Slowdown there are times where
competitors will go do an acquisition or
competitors will come out with something
that feels in that moment for that one
particular feature like a a move and go
to market will put pressure on us or ask
us what are we doing in response to that
but I think that's a fair question and
we as a product team try not to get
defensive in that moment because I think
that's a fair question when they ask
it do you ever feel pinched or pressured
or unreasonably stressed out given all
this AI pressure like I feel like
everyone's like waking up at 3:00 a.m.
like AI what do like how how do you like
keep that straight in your mind how how
does that affect you if at all I would
say I feel more pressure for the company
to succeed and hit the numbers and do
what we need to hit our business
outcomes if I wake up at night it's that
or if I wake up at night it's because of
a people issue or a change that I need
to make in my
organization not a or not a particular
feature or a product thing we need to
build I think we jumped on top of AI
pretty early on and have had a good AI
strategy and a good steady state of
executing against it and releasing
product we could always do more but I
feel pretty good about where we are
specific to AI so if anything keeps me
up at night it's like are we going to
hit the number is there more I can do to
help us hit the numbers gotcha it does
feel like there's just like a lot of
hype in Ai and I I keep saying I think
the hype train is way ahead of where
reality is right now and so one question
is do you agree with that and then the
second question is the hype train I
think is actually going to hit the
station eventually and so how are you
actually staying aware of what's going
on and like how are you just making sure
that you're not falling behind so few
things I mean if you look at specific
like ai's been around a long time right
I graduated from college in the
 
looks different right now with the llms
right in generative AI has definitely
been a hype cycle or Elite frog and
Innovation and I think it's also much
more quick and accessible like if you
talk about building predictive models
and machine learning models or Monte
Carlo simulations like these kinds of
tools have been around a long long time
and they take a long time to build and a
very specific expertise in general to
build and then you talk about the llms
coming around and it essentially starts
to become an API and it's not really
that simple but it is very accessible
and democratized for everyone and easy
to use so that I think has helped create
this hype cycle I do think people are a
little bit overusing it and you see like
what I call magic wand ification which
is like just because you put a magic
wand in your UI doesn't actually mean
you drove some sort of new value with AI
and I think when people get unreasonable
pressure from their boards or their CEOs
or their go to market Partners to just
do AI but they don't actually have a
good idea yet that magic W ification
shows up and then you just have features
it's also very early on for monetization
and who's winning at monetizing AI
you're not really seeing all that much
of companies who are established
utilizing AI driving monetization you're
seeing AI Drive New companies really
quickly to come up or companies to stay
competitive and drive more value using
AI so I think that's an interesting sort
of piece of the puzzle to to watch I
mean I think you know just giving a
company a really high valuation because
they say they do AI That's
probably as we've all seen this movie
before
not going to last and not going to turn
out but I do really think ignoring it
and pretending like it's just a hype
cycle is probably the wrong thing
because it does really cool things I
mean even in your day-to-day life like I
use Chad chbt to write my great my
Grandma a
letter and you know you did I do every
week Grandma I hope Grandma's not
listening that's terrible Trisha why do
you do that way to put your heart into
that way to put your heart into those
letters okay okay okay she's 102 and a
half that feels worse this is getting
worse for me do you say can you write a
letter for2 year old is that how you
prompt it yeah well it knows her now
because it's Ai and here's the thing she
likes very flowery language and she
likes a lot of
words and that's not me and so I just
tell her like this is what the I have
two high school boys and I'm like this
is what they accomplished this week you
know Brady made the soccer state
championship and Jarrett's cross country
State and I tell it and I put some
pictures in there and I travel desertic
for work and then it like writes this
really beautiful letter that she really
appreciates do you print that out and
send it or do you at least write it this
is no no no I it's worse worse worse I
convert it to a PDF and email it to my
mother who reads it to her okay this is
a thread I'm so glad we pulled thank you
thank you for sharing that this is
amazing I actually this is so tangential
but I actually have a Founder friend who
will once a week prompt AI to say like
give me a letter like Abraham Lincoln
would write his his wife about how much
I love my wife and like he edits like
 
real life like this is not like real
human being at least you're like
actually putting in like some bullets
and you know you want to flush it out a
little bit more I can understand your
use case I think people are actually
like using this thing to like basically
not do any work though in relationships
and that's where it gets a little shitty
for me that's that is pretty shitty
Nolan I have another great example of
how I've been using it I keep dreaming
that when I retire that my husband and I
are going to get one those things like
the van the camper van we're going to
get a camper van like a sprinter van
yeah yeah yeah like a sprinter fan and
we're going to drive to Vermont and so I
sometimes just to like dream what it
would be like to not be on Zoom all day
I have chat gbt put make itineraries for
me in my Camber van you got to keep the
dreams alive whatever it takes whatever
it takes thank God we're on Riverside
here and not zoom speaking of the 90s
great Great era by the way we talked
about your being in your Prime earlier
before we started recording now I'm
visualizing you was 10 to having your
sons read you PDS letters but you know
we had talked Trisha last week about and
and myself too about being emerging
female Executives you know in the early
 
I mean I I remember being at in Yahoo
and I'm kind of like the only female
leader in the room and usually 15 years
younger at that than these male leaders
and so just wanted to to talk about your
journey there in your experiences
because you're a really strong leader
you know you work with the Todds the
Eric trones I mean they're very intense
like how how did you do that coming up
in your career and and some of the some
of the Winds and some of the scars yeah
I was a math major in undergrad and then
was a software engineer right out of
college and there definitely weren't a
lot of females women in th that role or
even as a math major for me at NC State
so it seemed it just seemed like the way
it was and funny early in my career it
really didn't bother me early in my
career I was just so driven and like so
ready to outwork everyone this is going
to sound really weird I can't believe
I'm saying this this is why we're this
is why we're here this is incredible
it's true I thought it was an advantage
when I was young in my career I was like
yep I can beat all these guys and they
are all going to know who I am and I can
actually remember interviewing for jobs
in college and you know it would be
those on campus interviews where people
would go in a group for the second round
on site together and I can remember
being the only woman and being 100% sure
when I walked out of there I'd be the
one to get the job and that it really
helped differentiate me and I probably
under understood what actually
differentiated me at that point in my
life being 21 but I definitely felt it
was an advantage early in my career and
I definitely just was very confident
very very driven very focused and ready
to outwork everybody and I just didn't
care and I would just go so I just felt
early in my career it wasn't it just
wasn't a thing and then you become a
little more mature and a little more
aware of what's actually happening
around you and how much business is
happening at the golf course or at
places you're not invited to and you
know when I was on the executive team at
enino where we did focus on diversity
and I did have a very diverse team I was
the only woman on the sea suite at that
time and you were there for a long time
six years were you the only woman for
six years on the SE Suite or the
majority of that time yes yes you know I
I just think as I got older it it
was more of an issue for me to
feel the weight of supporting other
women and making sure they had the right
opportunities and it's like the it
shouldn't be the only way you could have
the kind of successful career I did is
if you're just like you know willing to
outwork everyone and not everyone has
that same personality I have and not all
men do either and not all men had to do
you know some of the things I had to do
to be successful and so as I got older
and more mature I just really felt a
little bit more of the burden of
everyone else around me and also a
little less willingness to be so driven
to outwork and be the one and sort of
step on people even at certain times I
think I did in my early career versus
like bringing people together and that
is where it became a little bit more of
my mission and to help other women and
make it more Equitable yeah how much of
that is do you think about today as like
part of your responsibility given the
sea level title I absolutely think it's
part of my responsibility for sure to
advocate for other women and to make
sure that my
colleagues think about the broader
perspective and to ensure fairness in
the workplace absolutely do you think
that we've made progress with our fellow
male counterparts stepping up to that
yes I absolutely do I mean part of why I
did come to pendo was because I saw a
lot more women in the sea suite and on
the executive team than I had seen in
other places I worked and that was
attractive to me and also because we
display our diversity numbers out on the
website and so if they're public that
means you can't hide behind things and
it's something you have to talk about
and that was part of what attracted me
to come to pendo I absolutely do think
we've made progress but not enough I
mean we're not even close to having a
quality so disclaimer we didn't put this
on the
you know on the docket so we can strike
it but if if you feel okay with it like
given this conversation I'd love to get
your opinion on something noan and I
have been talking about for months now
which is this this trend of companies
basically laying off and cutting out Dei
and B Teams right and and de de
investing in in these resources and your
your opinion on that it is a complicated
one and we do not have to strike it it
is a complicated did one because when
you're under immense pressure for
profitable growth and to break even it
is easy to say that's a position that
isn't driving a business outcome you
know we spent the first however much of
this conversation talking about how much
pressure there is to reach the numbers
and to reduce spend and it's easy to say
this isn't something that drives
business results so I I understand how
it's happening but I don't think it's
the right thing to do and I think you
are
seeing
representation of women and minority
groups go down in a lot of
companies you are seeing a tone change I
mean all my friends that I talk to in
tech companies Feel Like H the the tone
to women and minorities is sort of going
backwards in terms of importance or ey
rolling important initiatives an
important employee resource groups and
getting funding for those things so I
think it's a real Miss because I believe
that diversity is the right thing to do
but I also believe that it drives
business results and will be more
innovated and successful if not
everybody looks the same and so I think
it's a mistake yeah it's a it's a really
interesting take Trisha because I think
I I think what we've seen with the the
last version of the Dei movement has
made a a lot of people feel like like
more divided than like more like
included and and I think this is where
the difference of opinions and and how
we interact with people what do you
think like the future of this thing
looks like like what do you think like
the right resources are for a company
because I Kelly and I have been
searching for these answers I don't know
if you know you have any ideas that
you've been thinking of I don't I I hope
I guess what I've been thinking about
and hoping is that you know my kids who
are in High School by the time they are
the ones running companies they'll just
have been raised different exactly
that's my hope like I think everything
we're doing right now in reality is a
crutch because of the lack of education
and the lack of exposure and the lack of
awareness that those of us who are
running companies today have and having
a dni initiative or leader or resource
groups are to help sort of fix that but
you you only we can fix things and so I
I I guess that is my hope and I don't
know if it's realistic or not yeah I
strongly agree with you I feel like it
has to start early in life otherwise
it's just like you get to the company
level and these things are ingrained in
people and how can how can you possibly
solve them at work every day well that's
that's why right these teams exist right
I mean we we try to shift people's
behaviors and their mindsets in these
companies they work in where do their
behaviors and mindsets come from we all
have stuff and you know my parents used
to be like what what are you doing for
your job you're trying to change
people's behavior why don't you just go
open up a restaurant like what what is
this so that that's what we're trying to
do is retrain how people were like
raised and so I I to I love that that
angle Trisha that we're we're doing that
now with these kids right I have two
boys too like figure it out I mean our
boys poor kids have to be raised by this
crazy woman so don't talk about me like
that they'll they'll learn they'll learn
they'll learn yes so just to transition
the last few minutes I'd love to do do
some real talk around HR right clearly
we have to my favorite your favorite I
you know I'd love just to kick off this
this chat between us three with with
maybe how things have changed for you
right you've been working in Tech a long
time 10 15 years ago I mean how has your
perception of this function shifted from
then to now what did you expect then
what do you expect now how's that
Evolution taken place sure it was a fun
one well I love that you called it a
function because there are certain
departments at a company that I call the
functions actually learned that from my
last boss at
Ino and I also fondly call them the
department of no and I'm not going to
name these specific departments unless
you push me and I will then but the
department of no those are the people
who have a very important job of
actually making the business not move
forward are you describing legal
security legal you know
accounting you know and and and you know
I'm being a little sarcastic because
obviously those things are important to
keep us safe but they are the department
of no and they do like to slow things
down and I think for
me on my tech Journey it's thinking
about our people teams from an HR
department which is part of the
functions or the department of no to a
people team which is becoming a
strategic partner to yes and
understanding the outcomes and what
you're trying to achieve and take your
really smart great people and help you
learn how to make them work together to
achieve your goals and when you can get
that kind of a relationship it is
special and I have had that at at pendo
for sure yeah yeah you're describing yes
and yeah yeah that's a really great way
to frame it which is yeah Trish I hear
what you're saying and I think if we
tried it this way it would actually be
more effective that is that is it I
think in its best version you know to
take the other side so like Kelly you
and I talked about shat poopaa
who is now running a new company and is
saying like no
HR and and in fact no HR and HR is
actually run by the functional executive
The more I've thought on this one Kelly
the more I can understand like why
somebody feels that way because of
exactly what Trisha LED in with which is
like it is the Department of know at
many companies and then the other thing
is which Trisha didn't say is a lot of
leaders will basically just throw
over the defense and make it hr's
problem when it's actually like their
problem to go and solve so Trisha what's
your what's your take on this like push
back slash revulsion of of HR well I can
understand it because if you're only
experiencing sort of a more traditional
HR department of no policies and
procedures these are all the things you
can't do these are all the
rules you know know hey this person
isn't working out in my team help me
figure out how to up level this person
or find somebody better in the market
and they just pass like you know the the
the cover template report the TPS report
for you to fill out you know if that's
where you're coming from then I can
understand this need to say like I'm
trying to run a business I'm a leader I
understand my people I can run my
business I don't need the department of
no and the TPS report template
but I think if you have the Good Fortune
of ever working with a people team that
is actually business partners and that
can be that like sort of magic eightball
lens for you you know I can't spend
every moment thinking about how
everyone's going to react to this
communication that's coming in but my
people team often can and does right or
if I'm having a conflict between two of
my employees sometimes it's better
solved without me in the room and I'm
not shering responsibilities I'll get in
the room but sometimes it's more
effective to have an independent person
just work with people and I mean Kelly
has this magic of bringing laughter and
like just sort of bringing
approachability and real talk to the
conversation that sometimes as the boss
you just can't do so I think if you are
fortunate to have a real partner team
you wouldn't want that model yeah and I
mean we we talked about the chth comment
right Nolan I think it was like eight
months ago and I'd love to have him on
here but now he's like you know all
famous in the all in podcast and who
knows but he's been famous for a while
to be fair whatever so the point though
is I understand why he said that as well
but my disagreement is you're not
getting rid of HR you're just having
someone else do the work because the
work doesn't go away so it's a matter of
not trusting the people in those seat or
wanting them to be in those seat which
is what we're kind of talking about and
the last question I have Trisha because
I love unpacking executive spine sets
around this is I that the audience can
learn so much what does it look like and
feel like when you're working with a
great HR leader like describe not like
the adjectives they're this they're that
but like what does the week look like
how do you interact with them how often
what do they do you know day in and day
out little things big things like how
does that actually look if you were to
like describe it so someone else could
implement it if you have a real
relationship with your people team and
whether that's your business partner or
whether that's the chief people officer
then a lot of the conversations are not
what's on your calendar it's all the
things you're like going for a walk in
the morning or I'm driving to Raleigh to
the office and the phone call that ad
hoc I'm thinking about this can you help
me think it through hey can you just
listen to me brainstorm for a minute and
challenge the way I'm thinking I think a
lot like that's where the magic happens
in the relationship I think the on
calendar stuff is more of the you know
functioning Department work that has to
happen we've got to look at the review
cycle we've got to look at the nine box
we got to do succession planning like
and I'm saying those things funny I
realize those are important and these
are people's careers and they need
raises and I'm not diminishing the
importance of that but the ad hoc
conversation of like how do I take my
team from a b to an A or an A to an A+
and those come not from calendars I I I
love that it's the stuff off the
calendar such an easy way to delineate
or I'm struggling with Todd doing this
thing and it's making me mad talk me off
the ledge today or how am I going to
call him and approach it let me practice
it with you before I do it with him so
that we have a productive conversation
like that's a simple thing but that's
yeah and now of course I'm visualizing a
meeting on my calendar with the subject
line I'm struggling with
Todd happened it's happened it's
happened happened Trisha this has been
awesome I think it's really helpful for
our audience to get a perspective from
somebody like you who's like you know as
a as Chief product officer and your
relationship for like how you work with
people like me and Kelly so thanks for
sharing your insights we're super
grateful for it so good to have you my
friend thank you thank you for having me
