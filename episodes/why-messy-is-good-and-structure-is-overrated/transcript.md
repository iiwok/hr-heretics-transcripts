what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment to where we
are keeping going the dear Heretics
theme Kelly so today we have a note from
Andy who says uh Kelly really loving
what you and Nolan are doing for ASR
heretic straightforward non-fluffy
I love this stroke in the ego Bri job
you're really getting me into this uh a
challenge I've seen across many people
departments in later stages is the
ability to operate as a highly
collaborative single unit for the
business as people Department scale and
get larger silos forum and it becomes
increasingly difficult for HR Talent
tour Awards OE L &amp;d to operate as one
team align to the business how can cpos
ensure their people departments Foster
an environment of cross funural
collaboration and unity where the
business grows to a thousand plus
employees and the business needs to
become more complex and Global maybe a
good topic for you all to discuss in the
show thanks so much so Kelly what's your
take on how the the people team can kind
of work better cross functionally and
like you know speak the same language
yeah it's a great question Andy thank
you it did not stroke my ego just for
the record just so thank you for that uh
I have a lot of thoughts on this Nolan
so I mean you know starting from the
most simple of aspects I I don't know
about you but I'm shocked at how many
people teams don't spend time together
talking about the business and what's
going on with the strategy and the
market conditions and how that connects
back into the people in the organization
I feel
like maybe people get so busy and
they're wrapped up in the programs but
everyone just kind of starts doing and
they start doing in their own lanes and
there's not a lot of time allocated to
talking about how those Lanes come
together and service to what's going on
within that business so my first point
is simply spend more time talking about
the why and and and where this is going
versus running on the hamster wheel
executing stuff yeah so yeah your your
deal is like hey be intentional right
and come together and and talk about
what's working with s working um I'll
take a I I agree with you I will build
off of that um by actually starting like
I think people try and sexualize too
quickly that's actually like one of the
bigger learnings I had working at door
Dash so we had a GM model at D Ash in
the early days they still have a GM
model today uh but in the early days it
was kind of like a competition and so
like New York would be competing against
San Francisco which would be competing
against Houston and these GMS were like
operating their own little
foms and inside these foms people were
doing things radically different from
what Market to the next now you may
think well the downside of that is like
oh my God you got people running in
different directions and that was 100%
true the positive side of that was we
got to run so many different experiments
because people were doing things
differently and not the same and then
ultimately what we did is like as things
hardened and more uh firm in these areas
we got more clarity and data on what was
working what was not we were then able
to say hey this experiment Works in
Houston let's actually now go test it in
Chicago one of the big wearings for door
Dash though was not not every city is
the same and so the analogy and the
metaphor I want to use here for Andy is
like look engineering may be different
than product product may be different
than sales they might actually be
different things and so I would actually
caution you to say
one size fits all sometimes works and we
should definitely share learnings but we
should also be okay with each
organization having their own flavor and
empowering especially like the
executives and the leaders of that
organization to truly run it their way
while also serving you know the ultimate
culture of the company yeah and how to
Andy's question though how did you enjoy
that which sounds really useful and
helpful and also ensure that there was
glue so there wasn't silos like what
tactically happened to make sure that
those folks across you know that people
leadership team whatever it looked like
were connected what what what did it
look like the magic was the weekly
Business Review me okay so and go a
central place to stop drop and roll and
talk about the business how this is all
connected to that business awareness of
what's going on between fums or in
Andy's case L &amp;d HR business partners
recruiting
Etc it's really really important and
it's I've been surprised lately on how
many people like well I don't really
know what they're doing they're running
this program and they're doing this like
it has to be one experience do you know
what I mean that's where I think a lot
of HR people being pushed to think like
product managers now where it's like how
are you architecting this one experience
all the way through and every pillar or
function that makes up a people team has
to understand their part in that and how
they're connected to everyone else
ultimately to the organization the
business yeah I hear so totally agree
with you that the wbr was like the magic
thing that brought everybody together
yeah to where we could be like and and
you know with WB it's like we could just
look at data and see like what's working
in what Market what's working what's not
working in another market and very
quickly like we should stop doing this
and we should keep doing more of this in
HR it's it's a lot harder um I think
because a lot of the feedback uh is
qualitative right it's like well well
like this exactly loves this thing I
think we have to like lean into more of
that um and also some of these
departments they have different
radically different CRVs to
solve um and so my take is is like uh
the first thing you should optimize for
is ensuring that you are solving the
problems of the Business Leaders like
that is like thing one um and that means
sometimes like you know Engineers going
through a big hiring SP great they're
going to be bore of the the recruiting
team
and maybe the L&amp;D isn't that big of a
deal there versus like you know in sales
like we really need to work on sales
trading and get that chicken order right
and so I think being okay with that but
I also like I just get really concerned
about having this like peanut butter
approach yeah for the entire company I'm
more of like a like let them run and
take those learnings back but to your
point you have to have the magic moment
to where we can learn from each other
yeah there there are two other things
I'd offer you know for Andy on this one
is I'll just speak at pendos is my last
you know role like we we would not work
where it's like here are the recruiting
priorities and here are the operations
priorities and here are the org
development priority I would it would we
all made a joke of it which was kind of
fun we would have gradients like you
know what I mean like red plus yellow is
orange and we'd have priorities shared
by like hene and dni what is that they
would work together like there wouldn't
be siloed road maps or priorities or
strategies they' be gradients that would
be visual in terms of like these colors
right like blue and yellow is green so
we have our org Dev hrbp teams with our
L &amp;d leads and our programs people
working on a green priority which is the
gradients of those organizations
together and they would literally again
work together on those priorities that
would be that experience not the
Tactical things those pillars are siloed
and
doing hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after award from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metav view is the AI assistance for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident and inform decisions and
talent leaders can finally take control
of the interview process join Forward
Thinking Talent leaders leaders at high
performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and Kora and check out
medavie head over to metav view. a/
herotic to talk to one of metav VI's
product experts or get started for free
you'll be UPR running an AI enabled in
minutes just so I understand when you
say green like the the um the two colors
is that is that a business thing or is
that like on the HR team like it's on
the people's side it's on the people's
side so we never have just pure this
functions doing this under people it
would always sh so you're forcing
collaboration inside of the people team
that's right using very simple
kindergarten like situations which is
the colors equal a new color gradients
and I can share it it's really funny
actually it's it's it's it worked and
the second idea which we were going to
think about actually implementing as we
got bigger right 1500 2,000 plus is
structurally this idea of pods on the
people team versus to your I think you
mentioned this earlier Nolan
centralization so instead of having all
recruiting is here and all hrbps are
here and all L&amp;D is here you literally
mix and match so your SWAT team pod it's
almost like mini GMS where you have an
hrbp lead an L&amp;D lead a hiring Squad all
in service to engineering product and
design and they literally work on things
that are specific to that organization
that might be very different than what
sales needs with the through plet line
of universal things that connect all of
them obviously but they are dedicated
PODS of cross functional people leads
that are actually an org chart team yep
I I love that idea um the other thing
I'd submit to so at Carta uh one of the
things Henry would always make a joke
about is we do like a really big reor
every like 12 to 18 months and he would
joke about it because people would
always like complain about the reor and
I was one of those people who was like
oh my God why are we doing this again
like why are we boiling the ocean if you
work T like what are we doing here what
problem solving and it was another one
of those things I was wrong about
because what was happening was the
business was
changing and so I would say like the
other thing to consider as you factor in
what is your word look like today it
should be oriented around the problems
of the business but if you're in a
growing company the problems of your
business are going to change and so what
you solve for today will be different
in the future and so I think the way
that you can you could think about this
is by telling people that hey this is
what we're solving for right now and I'm
not going to guarantee it but I'm going
to tell you in high likelihood in six to
nine months it's going to be entirely
different we're going to make some sort
of organizational change to go solve
this next big business problem yeah um
and I think that's where it was one of
the growth areas for me when I was in
the seat was well I had my team and it's
like all nice and it's like the or chart
which really pretty and I feel really
really good about this and that's not
what it's about what it's about is
ultimately solving the business problems
and making sure your a team yeah is
positioned to do that it's funny when I
was I remember when I was young like 23
 
you're doing a good job when it feels
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
messy that's when you'll know you're
doing a good job and I love the the
question people get now amas are we
going to have more or
changes yes I just don't know exact I
don't know exactly where when uh or how
you know and and the last thing I'll say
before we wrap is mobility I think I've
always felt this is a really important
aspect within a people team and it's a
great way to help with silos in like
through osmosis is just move people
around and or expect them to have
business context and Acumen around
what's going on in those other functions
like I always said if I left tomorrow or
like if one of you left I I should be
able to put the recruiting leader in the
OR development seat or you here like you
should be able to do that which is good
for their careers anyway but it also
naturally helps with silos it's great
feedback and thanks so much for the
question we got a Quee of like three or
four of these uh right now that are in
the oven Kelly and I are going to be
working on these over the next couple of
weeks but keep sending them in uh dear
Heretics is taken off Kelly has been a
great idea uh and Annie Dixon was for
the question again thanks all HR
