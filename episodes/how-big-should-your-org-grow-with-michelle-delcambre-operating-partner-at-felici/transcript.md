all right everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we have an awesome
episode with Michelle delcamp did I say
that right Michelle you got it close
enough okay all right so your career is
Awesome You Led Talent at zenitz
and data PR data bricks before joining
stripe as the head of people operations
and you were at Stripe from 200,000 to
 
partner at felicis which is one of the
best early stage VCS in the world thanks
so much for joining us today thanks for
having me I'm excited to be here all
right so I want to talk about the The
Benchmark your org thing that you guys
just launched at Ficus and I think this
this tool is so dope because it's one of
the things that I've thought a lot about
when I've been in the operating seat is
like how does my company compare against
other companies how should how big
should this org be so can you just
describe what the benchmarking tool is
and why you guys created it yeah so I'm
GNA quickly back my way into the answer
and talk a little bit about why I did it
before I talk about what it actually is
um so the net net is this Founders or
their HR leaders are asking me all the
time how their org should grow and I
frankly didn't have the best answer
everything available to me felt
anecdotal which didn't feel valuable to
them second employee spend is the single
biggest spend for most Founders right
and there are a crap ton of benchmarks
out there that measure Financial
efficiency and go to market metrics
there's a ton of stuff around SAS
benchmarks but these metrics for how
teams grow didn't exist they didn't
exist in this format and so I felt like
it was missing in the market and wanted
to create it and finally the metrics
that do exist are so SAS focused right
the unicorns of a decade ago were
consumer companies most recently the
unicorns have been SAS companies so all
of our metrics fit that model the
unicorns of the next decade though are
not likely to be SAS companies and so I
wanted to create benchmarks that are
relevant Beyond one type of company that
could be customized based on a broader
set of filters and could update as this
publicly available data changes and then
the last thing I will say is years ago
when I was at alassian if if you are a
candidate who I recruited at At Last
Hand the story will resonate but I used
to be really excited to tell people this
story about how atlassian had this
hockey stick growth and we had no boots
on the ground Salesforce it was this
really awesome model we had and of
course now everyone knows what plg is
but back then it seemed really novel and
cool to me but our org grew very
differently as a result of that than
what other orgs around us were seeing
and so it would have been very
interesting and cool for us at that time
to be able to have a model that was more
relevant for how our org should grow and
so all of those things kind of led into
US creating this thing we're really
excited about called Benchmark your org
and what it is is a free- to use tool
that leverages real data from 15,000
companies and it spans the most common
functions of startup has so you can log
in you can select your stage your sector
your sales motion your Revenue range and
your valuation range and you get a plan
that shows how you stack up relative to
your industry peers as it relates to
your org design and the other thing I
will say about it is I said this to you
Nolen when we spoke before but I think
benchmarks are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because they become
dated so quickly and they're only useful
as long as the data remains con
constantly refreshed and so the data for
this tool will be updated monthly so it
stays current um and
relevant so 15,000 companies is a
massive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] data set like how did
you guys pull that off yeah it's a good
question so we actually partnered with a
company called findom which if you're
not familiar with them they are designed
as a recruiting tool but they had all of
the data we were looking for and I
wanted to do this and I wanted to do it
quickly so it made sense for us to
partner with someone who already had
access to the data they have something
called a talent data Cloud platform that
generates these Dynamic 3D Talent data
images and it pulls from a variety of
sources there's a big long list from
publicly available LinkedIn to GitHub to
stack Overflow to Census Bureau and
Company funding announcements and
patents and Publications and personal
pages and there's all of this data out
there it just wasn't used in a way that
was allowing us to get these benchmarks
so we use their data and inputs along
with our filters and assessments around
Revenue new sales engine etc those
things to create these benchmarks and as
I said earlier it's 15,000 companies but
it is only ever going to include
companies that have fundraised in the
last 10 years because we think as
companies get older they just the data
becomes less relevant and it will update
monthly the thing I most excited about
is I think we'll start to see Trends in
how certain types of companies grow over
time that may be different than what has
been standard in the past and so that's
the thing I'm kind of most excited about
as this evolves why do you both think
that you had to build this like I'm just
G to you know it's Heretics this is Off
Script of course in my usual form that
it's 2024 and you you went out Michelle
and you couldn't find anything that was
helpful like what why is that I mean I'm
glad you created it I can't wait you
know to use it and check it out but I
feel like should have should have been
here like 15 years ago so what's going
on yeah I don't know I think the
technology that's available us to us
today the data sets that are available
the way we can model data and generate
data looks a lot different than it did
even four or five years ago and so I
think technology has evolved in a way
that's allowing us to do this and I mean
frankly I also think we we rely on this
Benchmark practice that's like go out
run a survey it works so we just keep
running the survey every year and I I I
don't think there's ever been a desire
to recreate it or do something a little
easier than it has been in the
past yeah I agree with I think it's Tech
too like um I remember when we were at
door Dash we had these questions all the
time and the way we would get these
questions answered is we would go to
Sequoia capital and we would just ask
like hey these are the 10 things that we
want to know that are important to us
like can you just go get those answers
same and and so COA did an amazing job
of keeping their data for their
portfolio as clean as possible but that
wasn't the same at other VCS like other
VCS like didn't care about it the
operators inside of the company already
have so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do that like
actually like reporting out on this so
other companies can get the benefit of
their data is not something that they're
usually thinking about um but I just
want to like click in for people to to
tell them like how important I think
that this is so I just ran a little
report using the tool and there's so
many things that you can see so like one
is headcount by function so like how big
should each of these orgs be depending
on your stage your size your your
company your your Revenue size all these
things management versus individual
contributors which is one of the things
that Kelly and I have talked a lot about
I have a take that I think we're going
to start seeing way more ices than
managers um like what is the overall
head count and then also attrition and
like what you can expect from Atri
attrition by function so Michelle how
did you come up with like those are the
things that people really care about the
attrition one specifically I will touch
on part of it is just normalizing
attrition it never ceases to amaze me
how often Founders are like we don't
want to lose people and I'm like
actually you kind of do sometimes want
to lose people and sometimes you want to
be the one who makes that decision that
people should leave your organization
and the others
are I think I think there are a lot of
things that contribute to a healthy
organization managers to ic's not just
from an or design perspective but we're
not going to accomplish this with the
Benchmark but from how they engage and
how information funnels from one level
to the next I think is important when
you think about building a healthy
organization and so I think just
understanding this sort of ratio of
managers to ic's and what that should
look like in your or is just critical
right um so these are all pretty
straightforward metrics and to your
point earlier Kelly it was shocking to
me that I couldn't go out and just say
why can't I see how many managers I
should have to I's or why is there just
the standard ratio across across the
industry and so really it was that these
things were missing and I couldn't find
an answer for these specific questions
there were a handful of other things we
thought might be interesting but it was
difficult for us to get the data where
we wanted it to be specifically around
things like diversity uh across orgs or
across functions and so that may come
out in a in a future version of this but
we couldn't get the data right um for
this for this uh for this skill and a
lot of a lot of us you know a lot of a
lot of folks in the CPO head of head of
people's seat are looking at metrics now
that are a blend of the business and the
people right not The Usual Suspects on
spans and layers and attrition and Etc
so are you all thinking about or have
you put in there things like Revenue per
employee um right percentage of spend on
R&amp;D etc those things have been creeping
up more and more yes um we've gotten in
front of it but that's something that I
think people leaders need to start
influx in into their strategies I agree
with that I I could talk to you all day
about the sort of missing uh people data
metrics that don't exist today I will
say we are working on a V2 of this
that's specifically for Felisa Founders
that will hopefully allow us to pull in
the types of data you're talking about
and will also allow us to drill more
deeply into specific companies so a
Founder can say I actually only care
about this chosen peer group and it's
these five companies what have those
companies done and so we're working on a
V2 of this that goes deeper and and
covers these these things that you're
talking about along with other things aw
that's awesome I'm excited I me applaud
for you all and more that we influx
those stuff in there and make right make
those metrics mainstream into the people
world I think the more will be at the
table so to speak which I don't this
thing is this thing is dope like if if
you're a cheap people officer ahead of
HR and you take this to your founder
like this actually feels like you're
showing up to the conversation with
actual data that your founder probably
hasn't seen so Michelle where can people
find this it is
www.us.com Benchmark or if you just
Google felicis Benchmark it comes up
sick okay I want to transition to talk
about the talent Vortex so you've talked
about this quite a bit on LinkedIn it
also has to do a bit about the attrition
conversation that we were just happening
so we can you just tell us what is a
talent
Vortex yeah so I think of a talent
Vortex this way it is a company that has
built something in a way that it is
pulling in the best talent out there
from the right backgrounds call it the
right universities the right experience
whatever and it is bringing them in for
a period of time that Talent is
improving and making that company better
and on the back end that company is
sending that Talent out into the world
better than they brought it in and
they're going on to do things like found
their own companies which is how we've
sort of modeled the talent Vortex images
but they're also going on to do bigger
interesting jobs at other startups and
other companies that are out there to do
cool
things so Michelle you know that startup
Founders don't want great employees to
leave right like there's there's all
these things that we feel when a great
employee leaves which is oh my God like
how am I going to explain this to the
board how am I going to explain this to
the company but like you're actually
describing I think a thing that's really
common amongst great companies which is
not only do they recruit great talent
which everybody agrees with but then
that great talent that they they coach
and they invest in then goes into the
world and does other things like yeah
talk talk about like how
how you feel about when Talent leaves
and why we look at this the wrong way I
I think there's a couple of things here
right like um I think of every company
and I'm I'm going to distill this down
it but there's like a team one a team
two and a team three and a great
employee at team one is not necessarily
the same grade employee at Team three
for example and so I think there has to
be this natural attrition that's
happening to keep the performance level
or to sustain Peak Performance across
your organization I think that's natural
and I think you should push for that and
I think in some cases that means talent
that you don't need anymore is leaving
and I think in some cases it means
Talent that's actually still great
talent is also leaving your organization
and I I think that's healthy and I I
also think really good Founders want
that and I would challenge if you are if
if you are telling the outside world
that you are building uh an organization
with the top talent and none of that
Talent is ever leaving I would question
whether or not that really is the top
talent are these really the most
Innovative people are these really the
people with the best ideas who are
capable of doing bigger greater things
all the time I'm not I'm not sure I
believe that that's true if they're all
staying at your organization forever and
ever Michelle What What In your
experience what what are the top reasons
why Founders don't want people to leave
like when you dig in like what are what
is that gut reaction like no they can't
leave what are those themes and how have
you helped them get over that I think
it's a I think it's a couple of things I
think first and the biggest thing is I
think people think if people leave
Founders and Executives think if someone
leaves your organization it's actually
because you've done something wrong and
in some cases it sure it is but in some
cases it actually isn't and so I think
helping Founders to overcome and and to
my point earlier about normalizing this
concept of people should be leaving your
Oregon and in fact you should have a
mental model of how and why and who
should be leaving at any given time I
think is important so the normalization
of that it's not that you've done
something wrong is that this is a
natural sort of part of running a
business is is one thing also think
hiring is hard and it's expensive and it
takes up a lot of time it never ceases
to amaze me how often a Founder is
surprised by how much time they are
spending on people and hiring related
things and so I think there is this
worry that they're going to be spending
more and more and more and more time on
this if they can't keep people and all
this I I I want to caveat this by saying
I do think you should be keeping most of
your people for a period of time right
I'm not saying everyone should be
leaving on a regular basis but I I do
think that there should be some natural
healthy healthy attrition and so I think
normalizing that people are leaving is
is one way of doing it and the other
thing is I think strong HR leaders
should be modeling and forecasting out
based on things like performance whether
or not you want to retain them from an
equity perspective who should be leaving
when they should be leaving and what
percentage of each function should be
leaving at any given time and I think if
if HR leaders are taking the lead on
doing that then it helps to to make it a
natural part of running the orgas
opposed to this weird unnatural thing
that's happening off to the side totally
that was my Family Feud number one
answer by the way if Founders just it
exhausts them to hire it exhausts them
to do the agency the time all these
things and so and then on the HR side
I've seen a tendency to like not plan
for that until boom someone goes and now
we're flat-footed and so that's why it's
even more exhausting because you're
behind the eightball and the whole thing
snowballs so I love that totally
hey everyone we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our
sponsors here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet Del lighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive
accessible and mobile First Tool people
actually like using it which is why
companies like Ryan a dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shoutouts and live streams among
other features help Elevate the employee

and tell on Nolan and Kelly from HR
Heretics sent
 
you also there's I mean we call it
literally regrettable attrition like I
don't know if we could call it like a
worse thing I remember putting together
board decks at Carta and having literal
anxiety when talking around regrettable
attrition and knowing that one of the
board members was going to be like well
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened here how did we
lose this person yeah yeah it's it's
it's like they left you suck attrition
that's what it's called 100% I think
there are things you can do though right
there are things you can do probably not
at earlier stage but at later stage
around really nurturing your alumni
population I think is important the
other thing is lots of companies see
Boomerang employees and once that starts
to happen and once you encourage that if
you're reporting on that it sort of
offsets this like o somebody left what
happened because yay somebody came back
what happened right and so I think those
are we miss those opportunities
Michelle you nailed it I had a post uh a
couple of months ago around this is like
reframing regrettable attrition to
incredible alumni yeah totally and it's
just like it also turns out that if you
can have people leave in a way to where
like they feel like they learned a lot
that they got a ton of value out of that
experience that you maintain the
relationship not only while they're at
another company could you potentially
leverage that relationship to help your
current company but your point around
boomerangs is something that I don't
think is discussed enough like we used
to have this feeling um in the early
days of door Dash that has now since
changed but it was like you're either
with us or you're against us and that
was a really shortsighted perspective
that we had at the time because it was
like you know we were competing against
Uber and so it was like you know we were
just we needed everybody all in all the
time and as the company has now matured
many people have gone back yeah and and
are now working there again and so talk
to me a little bit about like boomerangs
and why you think that that's so
important well actually I'm going to
answer this in two ways I'll start with
my answer on boomerangs which is this
like when you see people coming back it
helps to solidify that it isn't
necessarily that there's something wrong
with you the timing was off what that
person needed was different right there
was another opportunity that was going
to grow them in a way that you couldn't
necessarily at that time we saw a ton of
boomerangs at atasan um and it's because
we had reached a level of scale that was
no longer interesting or relevant to
that person and then later on WE reached
another level of scale that suddenly was
interesting or relevant to that person
and we could grow develop enable them in
a way that we weren't really set up to
do at the prior level of scale and so I
I think that that's why the boomerang is
important because it signal signals that
you're you're growing in a healthy way
and you're not actually pushing people
away because they don't like you it's
just the timing is wrong and the timing
doesn't stay right on any any one thing
um forever and the other thing I will
say which is is less about boomerangs
and more about this alumni population
and and to your point about you're
either with us or against us like
imagine if you join a company and you're
surrounded by really amazing people
that's great but imagine if you're
surrounded by amazing people and you
also have this amazing Alumni network
that you also benefit from and you are
in the company of and your name is
mentioned alongside like that that still
helps to attract Talent even though
those people are gone and if you view it
that way then it becomes a talent
attractor as opposed to something
negative that's happened in your
orc know Kelly that reminds me of what
Colleen McCreary says which is like you
want to be from a great place yeah and
it's so critical like it's it's it
sounds so obvious when you say it but
just as as somebody who has like been on
the inside when somebody you love leaves
like in that moment especially if you
get surprised which I think is a
separate conversation but like if you
get surprised in that moment all you can
think of is like oh my God how am I
going to explain this to the board
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we going to do you're
just thinking of all of the negative
ramifications of that person leaving
yeah I mean we've talked about it a
bunch being a great bring being a great
company
from you have to help people move on and
celebrate what they're doing next and I
remember one company it was you know I
had a board slide that we were churning
out this great talent and they were
founding new companies and they were
doing big things and that was celebrated
so I think it's somewhat on us too to
like make that part of the strategy um
not just play for it or play defense
right you're actually playing offense
with it and expecting it and holding up
a flag when you when you get it right
you know yeah now the whole team is
leaving and there's a bunch of themes
it's like yeah good job leader you're
turnning out great people and you're
ruining like there there is a balance
here to this um but I I think I think
the tides are changing for sure yeah
Michelle you did hit on one topic that
I'd love to unpack which we haven't
discussed on the show but I am
increasingly hearing more of from HR
leaders which is you know when obviously
we want we want great talent to stay but
then also it's okay if they leave but
you'd mentioned something specifically
around like what happens like when like
Equity or Andor comp gets way out of
whack right so we hire somebody in the
early days they've been you know they
were absolutely instrumental and maybe
their role isn't as instrumental now
moving forward
but we had comped them in such a way to
where now we're looking at them and
saying like the comp for the current
role doesn't actually justify what
they're doing yeah talk to me a little
bit about how you know those situations
and how you've handled them I look I
think that's natural I think this
happens in every organization I think
your the way you you build your com
structures and your comp philosophy
becomes more sophisticated and more
rigorous over time and there's almost
never a world where you don't end up in
a scenario where you have someone who is
over or underpaid and so the the basic
HR practices around writing compensation
I think are important um I think where
you run
into problems is in early days not even
the earliest days I'd say somewhere
around series A and B where you have a
little more cash to spend and you
start the Easy Button comp is the easy
button when you're hiring I can't close
this person's why I just pay them more
um I will close them and in some cases
that works but I I would argue in in a
lot of those cases and this is our point
before is that then those people end up
not not producing or not growing or not
expanding in the way that you need them
to to justify that comp over time and
every year they're looking for Market
refreshes and Merit grants and all of
those things and so you you increasingly
have to give them more to keep them
engaged and and to keep them around and
so I think in those cases like I'm a big
fan of the pay for performance model um
because then those people don't make
more money over time they kind of stay
where they are until they are within the
right range and then they start they
start to move up I think the
conversation we had Nolan that you're
remembering is one where I said I think
the word I use is at early stage comp is
broken generally exactly and I was I I
was referring more to just this
like I think the equity bargain we make
with early employees is flawed in that
we ask early employees to take less cash
in exchange for a larger ownership stake
in the form of
equity so basically we keep people from
becoming cash-rich by keeping salaries
low in the short term and then give them
an equity offering that requires them to
be cash-rich to purchase it so that they
can potentially see Financial upside in
the long term and I think there are a
lot of problems with that that I'm happy
to go into
interesting interesting what what about
like tender offers and secondaries that
those early employees arguably can take
way more advantage of than the rest of
us coming in later and pay for all those
like 30 Cent options yeah those those
happen so much later though than yep
like
it's not like they're happening in the
first two or three years they're
happening at like I mean I think stripe
has only done a handful and only
recently has done one that really makes
early employees who were going to lose
their Equity grants whole they don't
happen soon enough for those employees
and I think my issue Kelly is this right
like given how many startups fail this
whole like model around that is
extremely risky but a startup has almost
no chance of success if they can't get
good employees to join them so really
any future success a startup might have
is built on the backs of these earliest
employees who took the biggest risk and
took the lowest salaries and more often
than not actually end up losing and I
think my my other issue is that we have
this Equity model that was designed at a
time when companies were going public
way faster than they are now if you
think of the biggest private companies
right now stripe is like 14 or 15 years
old data bricks is a decade old Chim is
 
used to be that the IPO window was like
four or five years and we have model
that was designed for that time that no
longer exists because companies are
choosing to remain private for so long
and I I think I also break this into two
populations of people Kelly to your
point I'd argue that the very earliest
employees call it the first 10 to 20 who
join at Siege or at Siege stage take the
largest risk the companies are cash trar
salaries are low especially compared to
Market they offer these large chunks of
equity in the form of isos which cost
money to exercise so the choice is this
stay with a company for 10 to 15
years hope that there's a secondary
offering at some point in the interim or
walk away from value you helped create
in a company because you believed in
them took a risk sacrificed cash for
ownership and no one stays with a
company for 10 years and to my earlier
point the people you need from day one
are not the same people you need at
series C or Series E or whatever it is
so it doesn't actually benefit employers
to keep their earliest employees for 10
to 15 years anyway but the the comp
model is built to support them
yes so is your spot I'm going to get on
the soap box for a second because I've
been thinking about an article on this
topic but it's it's actually multi-prong
so the you're exactly right there is
this tradeoff between cash and equity in
which you are taking less cash for more
Equity ownership and the the you know
the recruiting pitch as I've given it a
million times to candidate candidates is
hey you're going to join early and if
we're successful you're going to have a
a disproportionately large outcome that
is
true if you exercise your options yes
and this is the piece that like nobody
talks about that I think is actually um
it really disproportionately affects
early stage employees that do not come
from wealthy backgrounds which it turns
out like the majority of early stage
employees don't don't and so I I've told
this story once before but you know when
I left door Das it was $70,000 for me to
exercise my shares and I didn't have
$70,000 and so I didn't exercise and
then at IPO that was worth millions and
I think there's there's a couple pieces
on this one there's the post-termination
exercise window ca ca just like last
week said
 
not exercising their
options uh that's one piece the other
piece that we never talk about is the
tax code oh you know the the tax code is
built in such a way to where if you're
an investor right you not only can you
get long-term capital gains which is
taxed at the lower rate than labor which
is absolutely insane but then in
addition to that you can get qsbs if you
invest early such that like the first 40
to 50 million if you're in there before
the the company has $50 million in
assets you get zero tax yeah meanwhile
if you're an employee working your ass
off building this compy company you have
a massive tax yes even if there's no
liquidity because of the the gain in the
strike price so it's like you're you're
screwed from both angles and I don't
actually hear about anybody trying to
change this and so what's your take like
is it even fixable it doesn't seem like
there's any inertia to fix it that's my
question is what like if I'm listening
to this episode what do I do do I give
more cash less Equity do I offer them to
pay for their Equity two years in kind
of thing I think there's there's four
options right one is simply to make it
common practice to extend the exercise
window to align with it the IPO
timelines of today right there's some
economic trade-off the option pool is
going to need refreshing at a faster
rate unexercised options aren't going to
go back to the pool there are people who
would argue that's unfair to those still
with the company I don't really think
that's a fair argument I think the
stronger argument against extending the
exercise window would be that there's a
scenario where companies can't increase
their pool fast enough because the board
won't approve it and then they can't
keep High performers or get new Talent
right so that requires companies to be
more thoughtful with their pools earlier
on and investors to take more dilution
and investors to take more delution 100%
there is a unique idea that I was
floating around for a while but to your
point about the tax implications no one
we kind of tabled it but I had this idea
that specifically for the first 10
employees that you could decrease the
risk for those employees by creating a
special option pool that seed stage
Founders could leverage to attract early
non-founder employees so it would be
this new class of shares that would
provide downside protection and share
liquidation preferences with the
investors in a downside scenario because
if you think if you join a seed company
and it fails at B there's a selloff or
an aqua hire whatever it is and the
investors get taken care of and the
founder gets taken care of and those
first 10 employees who took all the risk
get nothing right the problem with this
is it doesn't help with a longer term
exercise problem if the company does
well but I do think it makes it easier
for startups to attract top talent
earlier on and sort of there's an
economic acknowledgement of the risk
that they took but the problem with it
is that the tax implications of the
special pool of stock for those
people is terrible like the increased
tax burden is so high that it it
actually hurts employees more than the
economic benefit might actually help
them and so it's hard to get creative
about how to incentivize employees
without acknowledging that the taxes are
a problem yep there's one other unique
solution which is to like
split your original Equity Grant into
common and founder preferred where every
employee gets some sort of I was just I
was just gonna bring this up so Howard
lurman uh who is the uh founder of he
was the founder of yex he's now the
founder of a company called Rome um I
saw him speak last year and he blew my
mind with this idea he was like the
notion that Founders get this insanely
cheap stock to exercise and early
employees don't is inherently unfair and
so what he has done for like the first
 
them Founders and given them founder
shares and I I had never heard I never
even considered this idea because it's
like it's it's it feels so far out of
left field that you would give
nonfounders founder shares but when you
actually think about the implications of
it it is the way to like Bend the rules
so I'll try my best to to explain this
but you tell me if I miss any gaps so
basically um when you get founder shares
they are insanely cheap to exercise and
you basically exercise them right away
so any appreciation on those shares you
will not pay taxes on until there is a
liquidity event right versus with
options um options typically are more
expensive and can be very expensive
especially if you're joining like series
a series B the company's doing quite
well
um and most employees don't even have
the opportunity to early exercise those
options that's actually something that
you have to ask for or typically
negotiate and so that's what I learned
from Howard and I was like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that's a great idea I feel like more
Founders need to push it but I don't
even know if enough Founders know about
it know that it's an option the other
thing is with the common shares as they
exist for employees say the isos that
you're talking about they don't get the
opportunity to sell those in future
fundraising rounds at fair market value
until the company is valued so so high
that it's it's it's almost too late but
Founders can share at or sell at every
fundraising round investors can sell at
every fundraising round right right and
so and I don't think anyone right now is
feeling bad for successful Founders or
or successful investors right but there
is this early population of employees
that people should be feeling feeling
bad for I'd like to scratch that no one
really know they don't even know about
it who does know about this like
Michelle did you just read about this
did you think about it at midnight one
night like is compensia out there
telling people this because I've never
heard this and I've been working with
capensia for 15 years yeah I mean I
think I read about it I would not say
that I'm an expert in tax law or uh
Equity or shares or or any of this stuff
but I would say that I'm an expert in
hearing the The Phrase My Equity is
broken or I can't afford to exercise and
so I can see the themes and the trends
that suggest there's a real problem here
and so I just started reading about what
is what is possible and I started
exploring what if we just made a whole
new like a whole new type of share like
what what would that mean but then we
started talking to you know 409a
evaluators and tax people and it was
like whoa hold your horses this is
actually worse than you think it is and
I don't think the IRS is into being
creative about uh fixing the tax code to
to to also they're not the 409a people
aren't either because they they haven't
seen it right and because they have this
is what I learned at Carta is it was so
hard to innovate in the 409a space
because they're just they're pattern
matchers they've only seen what they've
seen and so when you're trying to
innovate they're like well we don't know
what that's going to mean for your
valuation and they don't want to deal
with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so Kelly when I heard
this in November of last year I was like
holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not only is it a great idea
you literally have a Founder that's
taken a company public who is saying I
think this is the way that we should be
doing this and I am personally doing it
and every investor who invest ask me
this question and I say it's the right
thing to do for employees and so again
huge shout out to Howard lurman who's
the CEO of Rome for pushing this and I
think like this is a this is a piece of
this conversation I'd love to cut out
and share with more people because it it
needs to get more discussion and by the
way as the go ahead I'm digging into
this because I I believe this is how new
practices start yes right exactly this
is how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] changes with someone like
Michelle or how like being like listen
here's the deal and I and I asked
specifically why you know it hasn't
changed and and the the the answer is
because we've always done it this way
because we don't want to deal with it
and Tech anything you want like insert
the blank laziness and a little bit of
fear and complacency is usually the
reason and I def there's other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to
focus to be fair there's just so much
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to focus on when you're building a
company that it's like oh my God like
are we really going to go break ground
in the area that actually doesn't have
to do with our Revenue well I don't mean
I don't mean the companies Nolan I mean
just the general rule makers we don't
want to deal we don't want to change
things that that's what I'm trying to
get at here I think I think Founders
would do it in two seconds if it was
laid out it's just it's a thing it's
it's a thing that needs to change and
that's why I asked and I love it this is
great okay I want I want preferred
founder shares is is my takeway you
should demand that in your next
role see how that goes I I I actually
think if you joined an early stage
company Kelly that was less than 20
people I think you'd be surprised at
that you'd probably be able to get it
done I just think nobody asked for this
either because how to ask and while
we're here Michelle I do have a question
for you um you know to the spirit of the
cerous children usually have no shoes
right the HR folks Chief people officers
it's amazing to me because I I mentor
and Coach a lot of folks during their
offer process what we ourselves don't
think about or ask for in these offer
negotiations and if you had to pick kind
of one area or one thing that you would
counsel anyone listening to pay
attention to in their own offers what
would that
be I think a thing that the exit
packages specifically around shorter
tenure um pre-negotiate those especially
above a certain level I think is an
interesting approach and especially when
you are joining an earlier Stage Company
when you're those are two separate
things right senior at a later company
or joining an earlier Stage Company
where there is high risk and in a lot of
cases Founders are new to hiring they're
not quite sure what they need they make
a hire they don't exactly know how to
make that person successful so it's a
failure and they want that person to go
and so I think that's an interesting um
thing to consider is is sort of
pre-negotiated exit uh I also think one
of the things we uh did at zenefits
which I thought was interesting was for
our employee referral program when we
early on when we had people uh wanting
to negotiate more equity in their offers
we would say we'll give you the equity
package we initially offered you and if
you can join us and you can help us hire
six amazing people in your first six
months we will give you you're actually
acting like an owner and then we will
give you more of an ownership stake to
align such a idea because you've
delivered on something that actually
helps the business and so I think those
types of things where there's going to
be an ask of you in the business if you
can negotiate something around those I
think is interesting too that second
piece is such a good idea I have never
heard that I
I do want to come back to pre-negotiated
Severance and the look that Kelly gave I
know which is because of me by the way
we we argued about this about seven
months ago so when you said that I was
like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
yeah so let's talk about pre-negotiated
Seance I've done it twice I've done it
twice with Executives and it turned out
in both of those cases we exited those
executives in less than a year so again
n of two right very small sample size
but the like the pattern for me was like
the people that are
pre-negotiated their Severance is like
they're they're already thinking about
leaving like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on
here it feels like a red flag so educate
me as to why that shouldn't be the case
I mean I hear you say that and I think
yes but why like who has that much time
that they're like I'm going to go
through this whole interview process I'm
going leave my current job I'm going to
start a new job and I'm going to think
about quitting from day one that just
seems like a you know an awful lot of it
seems like no one's assuming bad intent
here Michelle is what it yeah like you
know and I I think most people have good
intent I would argue and Nolan you're
never goingon to invite me back but I
would argue that there was something
missing in the interview process there
was something missing in the job scope
or enabling them post hire that actually
led to them leaving and while I think
negotiating an exit package should be
more common practice than it is my guess
is that they might have been feeling
that too and so
while you know what I mean it was just
sort of The Perfect Storm for you in in
both of those cases but I think if you
run a good process if you hire the right
person if you know what you want and you
know what success looks like and you get
them in the role the likelihood that
they're going to join and be like I'm
just going to take advantage of this
exit package and start that process all
over again feels really really low to me
yeah you're actually right no she's
right she's in both of those cases we
did have gaps in the process and then we
ultimately had it it wasn't a role
change but it was like a responsibility
changed in both of those cases um and so
you're right that that's that is a gap
in my remembering of what happened in
those cases I just remember one case to
where it was like it literally took an
extra three weeks to negotiate it and I
was like this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] outrageous oh
that's right you were scarred with the
process yeah and it was like back and
forth with that person's lawyer and I'm
just like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we doing
here like you need you haven't you
haven't provided an ounce of work and
I'm spending all of my time negotiating
for when you leave you haven't even
started and so it just like annoyed me
but I do think yeah and I I do think
you're right though Michelle is like we
didn't have great processes for either
of those candidates and then I'm also
scarred because n of two both of those
people leave in a year and I'm just like
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we doing there is a
more positive spin on this which is I I
think it's also beneficial instead of
pre-negotiate your Severance for the
average employee to pre-negotiate their
refresh what are the milestones at year
one or year two what should my impact be
like clearly what should my impact be um
to to get a refresh that is is
Meaningful I think it's potentially
interesting and a more positive spin
instead of joining thinking you're
leaving it's joining thinking I'm going
to crush this and you're going to want
to keep me so much that it makes sense
for us to do this this has been like my
favorite episode so far I still have
like another question for you this is
great um holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm just going
to try and like settle myself after
learning so much so far so last question
is you're now an operating partner at
one of the best early stage VCS in the
world what are the common mistakes that
Founders make and how can HR and and
other operators help these
Founders yeah that's a great question
I think there are three maybe four but I
I'd say there are three mistakes that I
think Founders make very often the first
one is probably going to feel
controversial which is they mistake lots
of activity and working long hours for
productivity they glorify the grind of a
startup and I think that's a mask for we
actually don't have operating rigor and
I'm I'm this is not really a about the
downside of long hours more about the
risk that they churn through talent and
set really bad foundations for how work
gets done which is going to burn as they
scale so that's that's the first one the
second thing is I hear a lot of Founders
talking about culture and I'm not sure
that they've actually gred onto the fact
that that your your culture is the
primary tool to sustain Peak Performance
to enable your employees to have an
impact and to do it fairly autonomously
and to make hard decisions easier and so
I think Founders don't actually
understand why they care about culture
and I think they wait too long to codify
it and then the last thing and probably
the most detrimental thing I think is
they don't actively reinvent or reinvest
in themselves at each stage of growth
and so they stay the same person they
were and they don't actually scale with
the organization in the way in the way
that they need to and I like in terms of
how HR helps like I tend to think that
the HR role and the Ops role are kind of
like becoming one in a lot of ways and
so so I will say this to sustain Peak
Performance you need to know what it
looks like you need to know what matters
your employees need to know how do I
work on only the things that are going
to drive this business forward at any
given time and your guiding principles
should drive that culture and make it
clear what to do when you're faced with
a trade-off or a hard decision and I see
Founders All the Time create these goals
and missions their principles how they
want to behave and the minute it becomes
uncomfortable for them to use them they
waver or they make a decision that isn't
actually aligned with principles that
bleeds into the rest of the organization
and creates a lot of uncertainty for how
work gets done how decisions are made
all that stuff and everything slows down
to a halt and I think a truly strategic
R leader who also operates like a CEO
can design HR programs to mitigate this
and can help Founders to minimize the
discomfort that comes with those
tradeoffs and specifically as it relates
to actively Reinventing or reinvesting
in themselves um I wrote this down
because it sticks with me Sati Nella
said this thing about being a CEO which
was it's a lonely place you've got to be
the one to take some risk and that
emanates from your world view as a CEO
you have to have an absolute first class
view of where the world world is going
and I like this because being a CEO is
uncomfortable it's lonely you have to be
comfortable taking risks you're doing a
lot of things for the first time and I
think early CEOs run the risk of getting
to a good place in they're learning and
becoming complacent and not realizing
that with each stage of growth their
world is changing their company is
changing their role is changing where
they need to be spending time has
changed and if you think about it the
like the first job of a CEO founder is
not very CEO right the number one goal
is building something cool and finding
people who want to use it they delegate
nothing they're talking to customers
they're writing code they're making
design decisions they're interviewing
and hiring every single person that
joins and it's not really about building
a company it's just about generating
enough demand for your product that you
have to hire more people right but once
you move past that product Market fit
phase CEOs get confused about what their
role is and I have I have this thing I
say all the time which is that the CEOs
who need help think they're building a
really precious product and for a while
they are but the best CEOs realize that
actually building a company and when
they realize that it becomes clear that
they need to step away from a lot of the
early CEO activities um and that's hard
and this is where a really strong HR
leader comes into play helps them do
that makes them better teaches them
delegating and the last thing I will say
because I realized I've been talking
forever is as a CEO delegates there are
three things they will never delegate
culture pushing alignment and vision and
hiring and all of those things that a
CEO cannot delegate are squarely in the
Wheelhouse of a strong HR leader and an
HR leader can help help them with all of
those things that always have to be done
by them yeah I could not agree more well
well said and your second point about
helping to codify and build a culture at
that time where the CEO moves from
building a product to building a company
it is insane how important that is and I
I coach Founders all the time all the
time that is it is an invisible headwind
or a Tailwind it's GNA be one or the
other and you can't see it you might not
see it in dollars but holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does it
impact your p&amp;l more you'll ever know
yes like it is and it changes it
constantly changes as the company
becomes more successful and so it's not
like the Ten Commandments that never
updates it actually should be updated as
the company continues to grow yes yes I
agree with that damn Michelle I have
learned so much in this conversation our
audience is going to love this episode
