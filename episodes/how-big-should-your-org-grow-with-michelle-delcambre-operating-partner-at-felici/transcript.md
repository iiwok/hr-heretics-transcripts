right so I want to talk about the The
Benchmark your org thing that you guys
 
Benchmark your org thing that you guys
just launched at Ficus and I think this
 
just launched at Ficus and I think this
this tool is so dope because it's one of
 
this tool is so dope because it's one of
the things that I've thought a lot about
 
the things that I've thought a lot about
when I've been in the operating seat is
 
when I've been in the operating seat is
like how does my company compare against
 
like how does my company compare against
other companies how should how big
 
other companies how should how big
should this org be so can you just
 
should this org be so can you just
describe what the benchmarking tool is
 
describe what the benchmarking tool is
and why you guys created it yeah so I'm
 
and why you guys created it yeah so I'm
GNA quickly back my way into the answer
 
GNA quickly back my way into the answer
and talk a little bit about why I did it
 
and talk a little bit about why I did it
before I talk about what it actually is
 
before I talk about what it actually is
um so the net net is this Founders or
 
um so the net net is this Founders or
their HR leaders are asking me all the
 
their HR leaders are asking me all the
time how their org should grow and I
 
time how their org should grow and I
frankly didn't have the best answer
 
frankly didn't have the best answer
everything available to me felt
 
everything available to me felt
anecdotal which didn't feel valuable to
 
anecdotal which didn't feel valuable to
them second employee spend is the single
 
them second employee spend is the single
biggest spend for most Founders right
 
biggest spend for most Founders right
and there are a crap ton of benchmarks
 
and there are a crap ton of benchmarks
out there that measure Financial
 
out there that measure Financial
efficiency and go to market metrics
 
efficiency and go to market metrics
there's a ton of stuff around SAS
 
there's a ton of stuff around SAS
benchmarks but these metrics for how
 
benchmarks but these metrics for how
teams grow didn't exist they didn't
 
teams grow didn't exist they didn't
exist in this format and so I felt like
 
exist in this format and so I felt like
it was missing in the market and wanted
 
it was missing in the market and wanted
to create it and finally the metrics
 
to create it and finally the metrics
that do exist are so SAS focused right
 
that do exist are so SAS focused right
the unicorns of a decade ago were
 
the unicorns of a decade ago were
consumer companies most recently the
 
consumer companies most recently the
unicorns have been SAS companies so all
 
unicorns have been SAS companies so all
of our metrics fit that model the
 
of our metrics fit that model the
unicorns of the next decade though are
 
unicorns of the next decade though are
not likely to be SAS companies and so I
 
not likely to be SAS companies and so I
wanted to create benchmarks that are
 
wanted to create benchmarks that are
relevant Beyond one type of company that
 
relevant Beyond one type of company that
could be customized based on a broader
 
could be customized based on a broader
set of filters and could update as this
 
set of filters and could update as this
publicly available data changes and then
 
publicly available data changes and then
the last thing I will say is years ago
 
the last thing I will say is years ago
when I was at alassian if if you are a
 
when I was at alassian if if you are a
candidate who I recruited at At Last
 
candidate who I recruited at At Last
Hand the story will resonate but I used
 
Hand the story will resonate but I used
to be really excited to tell people this
 
to be really excited to tell people this
story about how atlassian had this
 
story about how atlassian had this
hockey stick growth and we had no boots
 
hockey stick growth and we had no boots
on the ground Salesforce it was this
 
on the ground Salesforce it was this
really awesome model we had and of
 
really awesome model we had and of
course now everyone knows what plg is
 
course now everyone knows what plg is
but back then it seemed really novel and
 
but back then it seemed really novel and
cool to me but our org grew very
 
cool to me but our org grew very
differently as a result of that than
 
differently as a result of that than
what other orgs around us were seeing
 
what other orgs around us were seeing
and so it would have been very
 
and so it would have been very
interesting and cool for us at that time
 
interesting and cool for us at that time
to be able to have a model that was more
 
to be able to have a model that was more
relevant for how our org should grow and
 
relevant for how our org should grow and
so all of those things kind of led into
 
so all of those things kind of led into
US creating this thing we're really
 
US creating this thing we're really
excited about called Benchmark your org
 
excited about called Benchmark your org
and what it is is a free- to use tool
 
and what it is is a free- to use tool
that leverages real data from 15,000
 
that leverages real data from 15,000
companies and it spans the most common
 
companies and it spans the most common
functions of startup has so you can log
 
functions of startup has so you can log
in you can select your stage your sector
 
in you can select your stage your sector
your sales motion your Revenue range and
 
your sales motion your Revenue range and
your valuation range and you get a plan
 
your valuation range and you get a plan
that shows how you stack up relative to
 
that shows how you stack up relative to
your industry peers as it relates to
 
your industry peers as it relates to
your org design and the other thing I
 
your org design and the other thing I
will say about it is I said this to you
 
will say about it is I said this to you
Nolen when we spoke before but I think
 
Nolen when we spoke before but I think
benchmarks are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because they become
 
benchmarks are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because they become
dated so quickly and they're only useful
 
dated so quickly and they're only useful
as long as the data remains con
 
as long as the data remains con
constantly refreshed and so the data for
 
constantly refreshed and so the data for
this tool will be updated monthly so it
 
this tool will be updated monthly so it
stays current um and
 
stays current um and
relevant so 15,000 companies is a
 
relevant so 15,000 companies is a
massive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] data set like how did
 
massive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] data set like how did
you guys pull that off yeah it's a good
 
you guys pull that off yeah it's a good
question so we actually partnered with a
 
question so we actually partnered with a
company called findom which if you're
 
company called findom which if you're
not familiar with them they are designed
 
not familiar with them they are designed
as a recruiting tool but they had all of
 
as a recruiting tool but they had all of
the data we were looking for and I
 
the data we were looking for and I
wanted to do this and I wanted to do it
 
wanted to do this and I wanted to do it
quickly so it made sense for us to
 
quickly so it made sense for us to
partner with someone who already had
 
partner with someone who already had
access to the data they have something
 
access to the data they have something
called a talent data Cloud platform that
 
called a talent data Cloud platform that
generates these Dynamic 3D Talent data
 
generates these Dynamic 3D Talent data
images and it pulls from a variety of
 
images and it pulls from a variety of
sources there's a big long list from
 
sources there's a big long list from
publicly available LinkedIn to GitHub to
 
publicly available LinkedIn to GitHub to
stack Overflow to Census Bureau and
 
stack Overflow to Census Bureau and
Company funding announcements and
 
Company funding announcements and
patents and Publications and personal
 
patents and Publications and personal
pages and there's all of this data out
 
pages and there's all of this data out
there it just wasn't used in a way that
 
there it just wasn't used in a way that
was allowing us to get these benchmarks
 
was allowing us to get these benchmarks
so we use their data and inputs along
 
so we use their data and inputs along
with our filters and assessments around
 
with our filters and assessments around
Revenue new sales engine etc those
 
Revenue new sales engine etc those
things to create these benchmarks and as
 
things to create these benchmarks and as
I said earlier it's 15,000 companies but
 
I said earlier it's 15,000 companies but
it is only ever going to include
 
it is only ever going to include
companies that have fundraised in the
 
companies that have fundraised in the
last 10 years because we think as
 
last 10 years because we think as
companies get older they just the data
 
companies get older they just the data
becomes less relevant and it will update
 
becomes less relevant and it will update
monthly the thing I most excited about
 
monthly the thing I most excited about
is I think we'll start to see Trends in
 
is I think we'll start to see Trends in
how certain types of companies grow over
 
how certain types of companies grow over
time that may be different than what has
 
time that may be different than what has
been standard in the past and so that's
 
been standard in the past and so that's
the thing I'm kind of most excited about
 
the thing I'm kind of most excited about
as this evolves why do you both think
 
as this evolves why do you both think
that you had to build this like I'm just
 
that you had to build this like I'm just
G to you know it's Heretics this is Off
 
G to you know it's Heretics this is Off
Script of course in my usual form that
 
Script of course in my usual form that
it's 2024 and you you went out Michelle
 
it's 2024 and you you went out Michelle
and you couldn't find anything that was
 
and you couldn't find anything that was
helpful like what why is that I mean I'm
 
helpful like what why is that I mean I'm
glad you created it I can't wait you
 
glad you created it I can't wait you
know to use it and check it out but I
 
know to use it and check it out but I
feel like should have should have been
 
feel like should have should have been
here like 15 years ago so what's going
 
here like 15 years ago so what's going
on yeah I don't know I think the
 
on yeah I don't know I think the
technology that's available us to us
 
technology that's available us to us
today the data sets that are available
 
today the data sets that are available
the way we can model data and generate
 
the way we can model data and generate
data looks a lot different than it did
 
data looks a lot different than it did
even four or five years ago and so I
 
even four or five years ago and so I
think technology has evolved in a way
 
think technology has evolved in a way
that's allowing us to do this and I mean
 
that's allowing us to do this and I mean
frankly I also think we we rely on this
 
frankly I also think we we rely on this
Benchmark practice that's like go out
 
Benchmark practice that's like go out
run a survey it works so we just keep
 
run a survey it works so we just keep
running the survey every year and I I I
 
running the survey every year and I I I
don't think there's ever been a desire
 
don't think there's ever been a desire
to recreate it or do something a little
 
to recreate it or do something a little
easier than it has been in the
 
easier than it has been in the
past yeah I agree with I think it's Tech
 
past yeah I agree with I think it's Tech
too like um I remember when we were at
 
too like um I remember when we were at
door Dash we had these questions all the
 
door Dash we had these questions all the
time and the way we would get these
 
time and the way we would get these
questions answered is we would go to
 
questions answered is we would go to
Sequoia capital and we would just ask
 
Sequoia capital and we would just ask
like hey these are the 10 things that we
 
like hey these are the 10 things that we
want to know that are important to us
 
want to know that are important to us
like can you just go get those answers
 
like can you just go get those answers
same and and so COA did an amazing job
 
same and and so COA did an amazing job
of keeping their data for their
 
of keeping their data for their
portfolio as clean as possible but that
 
portfolio as clean as possible but that
wasn't the same at other VCS like other
 
wasn't the same at other VCS like other
VCS like didn't care about it the
 
VCS like didn't care about it the
operators inside of the company already
 
operators inside of the company already
have so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do that like
 
have so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do that like
actually like reporting out on this so
 
actually like reporting out on this so
other companies can get the benefit of
 
other companies can get the benefit of
their data is not something that they're
 
their data is not something that they're
usually thinking about um but I just
 
usually thinking about um but I just
want to like click in for people to to
 
want to like click in for people to to
tell them like how important I think
 
tell them like how important I think
that this is so I just ran a little
 
that this is so I just ran a little
report using the tool and there's so
 
report using the tool and there's so
many things that you can see so like one
 
many things that you can see so like one
is headcount by function so like how big
 
is headcount by function so like how big
should each of these orgs be depending
 
should each of these orgs be depending
on your stage your size your your
 
on your stage your size your your
company your your Revenue size all these
 
company your your Revenue size all these
things management versus individual
 
things management versus individual
contributors which is one of the things
 
contributors which is one of the things
that Kelly and I have talked a lot about
 
that Kelly and I have talked a lot about
I have a take that I think we're going
 
I have a take that I think we're going
to start seeing way more ices than
 
to start seeing way more ices than
managers um like what is the overall
 
managers um like what is the overall
head count and then also attrition and
 
head count and then also attrition and
like what you can expect from Atri
 
like what you can expect from Atri
attrition by function so Michelle how
 
attrition by function so Michelle how
did you come up with like those are the
 
did you come up with like those are the
things that people really care about the
 
things that people really care about the
attrition one specifically I will touch
 
attrition one specifically I will touch
on part of it is just normalizing
 
on part of it is just normalizing
attrition it never ceases to amaze me
 
attrition it never ceases to amaze me
how often Founders are like we don't
 
how often Founders are like we don't
want to lose people and I'm like
 
want to lose people and I'm like
actually you kind of do sometimes want
 
actually you kind of do sometimes want
to lose people and sometimes you want to
 
to lose people and sometimes you want to
be the one who makes that decision that
 
be the one who makes that decision that
people should leave your organization
 
people should leave your organization
and the others
 
and the others
are I think I think there are a lot of
 
are I think I think there are a lot of
things that contribute to a healthy
 
things that contribute to a healthy
organization managers to ic's not just
 
organization managers to ic's not just
from an or design perspective but we're
 
from an or design perspective but we're
not going to accomplish this with the
 
not going to accomplish this with the
Benchmark but from how they engage and
 
Benchmark but from how they engage and
how information funnels from one level
 
how information funnels from one level
to the next I think is important when
 
to the next I think is important when
you think about building a healthy
 
you think about building a healthy
organization and so I think just
 
organization and so I think just
understanding this sort of ratio of
 
understanding this sort of ratio of
managers to ic's and what that should
 
managers to ic's and what that should
look like in your or is just critical
 
look like in your or is just critical
right um so these are all pretty
 
right um so these are all pretty
straightforward metrics and to your
 
straightforward metrics and to your
point earlier Kelly it was shocking to
 
point earlier Kelly it was shocking to
me that I couldn't go out and just say
 
me that I couldn't go out and just say
why can't I see how many managers I
 
why can't I see how many managers I
should have to I's or why is there just
 
should have to I's or why is there just
the standard ratio across across the
 
the standard ratio across across the
industry and so really it was that these
 
industry and so really it was that these
things were missing and I couldn't find
 
things were missing and I couldn't find
an answer for these specific questions
 
an answer for these specific questions
there were a handful of other things we
 
there were a handful of other things we
thought might be interesting but it was
 
thought might be interesting but it was
difficult for us to get the data where
 
difficult for us to get the data where
we wanted it to be specifically around
 
we wanted it to be specifically around
things like diversity uh across orgs or
 
things like diversity uh across orgs or
across functions and so that may come
 
across functions and so that may come
out in a in a future version of this but
 
out in a in a future version of this but
we couldn't get the data right um for
 
we couldn't get the data right um for
this for this uh for this skill and a
 
this for this uh for this skill and a
lot of a lot of us you know a lot of a
 
lot of a lot of us you know a lot of a
lot of folks in the CPO head of head of
 
lot of folks in the CPO head of head of
people's seat are looking at metrics now

influx in into their strategies I agree
with that I I could talk to you all day
 
with that I I could talk to you all day
about the sort of missing uh people data
 
about the sort of missing uh people data

say we are working on a V2 of this
that's specifically for Felisa Founders
 
that's specifically for Felisa Founders
that will hopefully allow us to pull in
 
that will hopefully allow us to pull in
the types of data you're talking about
 
the types of data you're talking about

and will also allow us to drill more
deeply into specific companies so a
 
deeply into specific companies so a
Founder can say I actually only care
 
Founder can say I actually only care

for you all and more that we influx
 
for you all and more that we influx
those stuff in there and make right make
 
those stuff in there and make right make
those metrics mainstream into the people
 
those metrics mainstream into the people
world I think the more will be at the
 
world I think the more will be at the
table so to speak which I don't this

and on the back end that company is
sending that Talent out into the world
 
sending that Talent out into the world
better than they brought it in and
 
better than they brought it in and
they're going on to do things like found
 
they're going on to do things like found
their own companies which is how we've
 
their own companies which is how we've
sort of modeled the talent Vortex images
 
sort of modeled the talent Vortex images
but they're also going on to do bigger
 
but they're also going on to do bigger
interesting jobs at other startups and
 
interesting jobs at other startups and
other companies that are out there to do
 
other companies that are out there to do
cool
 
cool
things so Michelle you know that startup
 
things so Michelle you know that startup
Founders don't want great employees to
 
Founders don't want great employees to
leave right like there's there's all
 
leave right like there's there's all
these things that we feel when a great
 
these things that we feel when a great
employee leaves which is oh my God like
 
employee leaves which is oh my God like
how am I going to explain this to the
 
how am I going to explain this to the
board how am I going to explain this to
 
board how am I going to explain this to
the company but like you're actually
 
the company but like you're actually
describing I think a thing that's really
 
describing I think a thing that's really
common amongst great companies which is
 
common amongst great companies which is
not only do they recruit great talent
 
not only do they recruit great talent
which everybody agrees with but then
 
which everybody agrees with but then
that great talent that they they coach
 
that great talent that they they coach
and they invest in then goes into the
 
and they invest in then goes into the
world and does other things like yeah
 
world and does other things like yeah
talk talk about like how
 
talk talk about like how
how you feel about when Talent leaves
 
how you feel about when Talent leaves
and why we look at this the wrong way I
 
and why we look at this the wrong way I
I think there's a couple of things here
 
I think there's a couple of things here
right like um I think of every company
 
right like um I think of every company
and I'm I'm going to distill this down
 
and I'm I'm going to distill this down
it but there's like a team one a team
 
it but there's like a team one a team
two and a team three and a great
 
two and a team three and a great
employee at team one is not necessarily
 
employee at team one is not necessarily
the same grade employee at Team three
 
the same grade employee at Team three
for example and so I think there has to
 
for example and so I think there has to
be this natural attrition that's
 
be this natural attrition that's
happening to keep the performance level
 
happening to keep the performance level
or to sustain Peak Performance across
 
or to sustain Peak Performance across
your organization I think that's natural
 
your organization I think that's natural
and I think you should push for that and
 
and I think you should push for that and
I think in some cases that means talent
 
I think in some cases that means talent
that you don't need anymore is leaving
 
that you don't need anymore is leaving
and I think in some cases it means
 
and I think in some cases it means
Talent that's actually still great
 
Talent that's actually still great
talent is also leaving your organization
 
talent is also leaving your organization
and I I think that's healthy and I I
 
and I I think that's healthy and I I
also think really good Founders want
 
also think really good Founders want
that and I would challenge if you are if
 
that and I would challenge if you are if
if you are telling the outside world
 
if you are telling the outside world
that you are building uh an organization
 
that you are building uh an organization
with the top talent and none of that
 
with the top talent and none of that
Talent is ever leaving I would question
 
Talent is ever leaving I would question
whether or not that really is the top
 
whether or not that really is the top
talent are these really the most
 
talent are these really the most
Innovative people are these really the
 
Innovative people are these really the
people with the best ideas who are
 
people with the best ideas who are

normalizing that people are leaving is
 
normalizing that people are leaving is

days of door Dash that has now since
 
days of door Dash that has now since
changed but it was like you're either
 
changed but it was like you're either
with us or you're against us and that
 
with us or you're against us and that
was a really shortsighted perspective
 
was a really shortsighted perspective
that we had at the time because it was
 
that we had at the time because it was
like you know we were competing against
 
like you know we were competing against
Uber and so it was like you know we were
 
Uber and so it was like you know we were
just we needed everybody all in all the
 
just we needed everybody all in all the
time and as the company has now matured
 
time and as the company has now matured
many people have gone back yeah and and
 
many people have gone back yeah and and
are now working there again and so talk
 
are now working there again and so talk
to me a little bit about like boomerangs
 
to me a little bit about like boomerangs
and why you think that that's so
 
and why you think that that's so
important well actually I'm going to
 
important well actually I'm going to
answer this in two ways I'll start with
 
answer this in two ways I'll start with
my answer on boomerangs which is this
 
my answer on boomerangs which is this
like when you see people coming back it
 
like when you see people coming back it
helps to solidify that it isn't
 
helps to solidify that it isn't
necessarily that there's something wrong
 
necessarily that there's something wrong
with you the timing was off what that
 
with you the timing was off what that
person needed was different right there
 
person needed was different right there
was another opportunity that was going
 
was another opportunity that was going
to grow them in a way that you couldn't
 
to grow them in a way that you couldn't
necessarily at that time we saw a ton of
 
necessarily at that time we saw a ton of
boomerangs at atasan um and it's because
 
boomerangs at atasan um and it's because
we had reached a level of scale that was
 
we had reached a level of scale that was
no longer interesting or relevant to
 
no longer interesting or relevant to
that person and then later on WE reached
 
that person and then later on WE reached
another level of scale that suddenly was
 
another level of scale that suddenly was
interesting or relevant to that person
 
interesting or relevant to that person
and we could grow develop enable them in
 
and we could grow develop enable them in
a way that we weren't really set up to
 
a way that we weren't really set up to
do at the prior level of scale and so I
 
do at the prior level of scale and so I
I think that that's why the boomerang is
 
I think that that's why the boomerang is
important because it signal signals that
 
important because it signal signals that
you're you're growing in a healthy way
 
you're you're growing in a healthy way
and you're not actually pushing people
 
and you're not actually pushing people
away because they don't like you it's
 
away because they don't like you it's
just the timing is wrong and the timing
 
just the timing is wrong and the timing
doesn't stay right on any any one thing
 
doesn't stay right on any any one thing
um forever and the other thing I will
 
um forever and the other thing I will
say which is is less about boomerangs
 
say which is is less about boomerangs
and more about this alumni population
 
and more about this alumni population

Michelle you did hit on one topic that
 
Michelle you did hit on one topic that
I'd love to unpack which we haven't
 
I'd love to unpack which we haven't

increasingly hearing more of from HR
 
increasingly hearing more of from HR
leaders which is you know when obviously
 
leaders which is you know when obviously
we want we want great talent to stay but
 
we want we want great talent to stay but
then also it's okay if they leave but
 
then also it's okay if they leave but
you'd mentioned something specifically
 
you'd mentioned something specifically
around like what happens like when like
 
around like what happens like when like
Equity or Andor comp gets way out of
 
Equity or Andor comp gets way out of
whack right so we hire somebody in the
 
whack right so we hire somebody in the
early days they've been you know they
 
early days they've been you know they
were absolutely instrumental and maybe
 
were absolutely instrumental and maybe
their role isn't as instrumental now
 
their role isn't as instrumental now
moving forward
 
moving forward
but we had comped them in such a way to
 
but we had comped them in such a way to
where now we're looking at them and
 
where now we're looking at them and
saying like the comp for the current
 
saying like the comp for the current
role doesn't actually justify what
 
role doesn't actually justify what
they're doing yeah talk to me a little
 
they're doing yeah talk to me a little
bit about how you know those situations
 
bit about how you know those situations
and how you've handled them I look I
 
and how you've handled them I look I
think that's natural I think this
 
think that's natural I think this
happens in every organization I think
 
happens in every organization I think
your the way you you build your com
 
your the way you you build your com
structures and your comp philosophy
 
structures and your comp philosophy
becomes more sophisticated and more
 
becomes more sophisticated and more
rigorous over time and there's almost
 
rigorous over time and there's almost
never a world where you don't end up in
 
never a world where you don't end up in
a scenario where you have someone who is
 
a scenario where you have someone who is
over or underpaid and so the the basic
 
over or underpaid and so the the basic
HR practices around writing compensation
 
HR practices around writing compensation
I think are important um I think where
 
I think are important um I think where
you run
 
you run
into problems is in early days not even
 
into problems is in early days not even
the earliest days I'd say somewhere
 
the earliest days I'd say somewhere
around series A and B where you have a
 
around series A and B where you have a
little more cash to spend and you
 
little more cash to spend and you
start the Easy Button comp is the easy
 
start the Easy Button comp is the easy
button when you're hiring I can't close
 
button when you're hiring I can't close
this person's why I just pay them more
 
this person's why I just pay them more
um I will close them and in some cases
 
um I will close them and in some cases
that works but I I would argue in in a
 
that works but I I would argue in in a
lot of those cases and this is our point
 
lot of those cases and this is our point
before is that then those people end up
 
before is that then those people end up
not not producing or not growing or not
 
not not producing or not growing or not
expanding in the way that you need them
 
expanding in the way that you need them
to to justify that comp over time and
 
to to justify that comp over time and
every year they're looking for Market
 
every year they're looking for Market
refreshes and Merit grants and all of
 
refreshes and Merit grants and all of
those things and so you you increasingly
 
those things and so you you increasingly
have to give them more to keep them
 
have to give them more to keep them
engaged and and to keep them around and
 
engaged and and to keep them around and
so I think in those cases like I'm a big
 
so I think in those cases like I'm a big
fan of the pay for performance model um
 
fan of the pay for performance model um
because then those people don't make
 
because then those people don't make
more money over time they kind of stay
 
more money over time they kind of stay
where they are until they are within the
 
where they are until they are within the
right range and then they start they
 
right range and then they start they
start to move up I think the
 
start to move up I think the
conversation we had Nolan that you're
 
conversation we had Nolan that you're
remembering is one where I said I think
 
remembering is one where I said I think
the word I use is at early stage comp is
 
the word I use is at early stage comp is
broken generally exactly and I was I I
 
broken generally exactly and I was I I
was referring more to just this
 
was referring more to just this
like I think the equity bargain we make
 
like I think the equity bargain we make
with early employees is flawed in that
 
with early employees is flawed in that
we ask early employees to take less cash
 
we ask early employees to take less cash
in exchange for a larger ownership stake
 
in exchange for a larger ownership stake
in the form of
 
in the form of
equity so basically we keep people from
 
equity so basically we keep people from
becoming cash-rich by keeping salaries
 
becoming cash-rich by keeping salaries
low in the short term and then give them
 
low in the short term and then give them
an equity offering that requires them to
 
an equity offering that requires them to
be cash-rich to purchase it so that they
 
be cash-rich to purchase it so that they
can potentially see Financial upside in
 
can potentially see Financial upside in
the long term and I think there are a
 
the long term and I think there are a
lot of problems with that that I'm happy
 
lot of problems with that that I'm happy
to go into
 
to go into
interesting interesting what what about
 
interesting interesting what what about
like tender offers and secondaries that
 
like tender offers and secondaries that
those early employees arguably can take
 
those early employees arguably can take
way more advantage of than the rest of
 
way more advantage of than the rest of
us coming in later and pay for all those
 
us coming in later and pay for all those
like 30 Cent options yeah those those
 
like 30 Cent options yeah those those
happen so much later though than yep
 
happen so much later though than yep
like
 
like
it's not like they're happening in the
 
it's not like they're happening in the
first two or three years they're
 
first two or three years they're
happening at like I mean I think stripe
 
happening at like I mean I think stripe
has only done a handful and only
 
has only done a handful and only
recently has done one that really makes
 
recently has done one that really makes
early employees who were going to lose
 
early employees who were going to lose
their Equity grants whole they don't
 
their Equity grants whole they don't
happen soon enough for those employees
 
happen soon enough for those employees
and I think my issue Kelly is this right
 
and I think my issue Kelly is this right
like given how many startups fail this
 
like given how many startups fail this
whole like model around that is
 
whole like model around that is
extremely risky but a startup has almost
 
extremely risky but a startup has almost
no chance of success if they can't get
 
no chance of success if they can't get
good employees to join them so really
 
good employees to join them so really
any future success a startup might have
 
any future success a startup might have
is built on the backs of these earliest
 
is built on the backs of these earliest
employees who took the biggest risk and
 
employees who took the biggest risk and
took the lowest salaries and more often
 
took the lowest salaries and more often
than not actually end up losing and I
 
than not actually end up losing and I
think my my other issue is that we have
 
think my my other issue is that we have
this Equity model that was designed at a
 
this Equity model that was designed at a
time when companies were going public
 
time when companies were going public
way faster than they are now if you
 
way faster than they are now if you
think of the biggest private companies

right now stripe is like 14 or 15 years
 
right now stripe is like 14 or 15 years
old data bricks is a decade old Chim is
 
old data bricks is a decade old Chim is
 
used to be that the IPO window was like
 
used to be that the IPO window was like
four or five years and we have model
 
four or five years and we have model
that was designed for that time that no
 
that was designed for that time that no
longer exists because companies are
 
longer exists because companies are
choosing to remain private for so long
 
choosing to remain private for so long
and I I think I also break this into two
 
and I I think I also break this into two
populations of people Kelly to your
 
populations of people Kelly to your
point I'd argue that the very earliest
 
point I'd argue that the very earliest
employees call it the first 10 to 20 who
 
employees call it the first 10 to 20 who
join at Siege or at Siege stage take the

are not the same people you need at
 
are not the same people you need at
series C or Series E or whatever it is
 
series C or Series E or whatever it is
so it doesn't actually benefit employers
 
so it doesn't actually benefit employers
to keep their earliest employees for 10
 
to keep their earliest employees for 10
to 15 years anyway but the the comp
 
to 15 years anyway but the the comp
model is built to support them
 
model is built to support them
yes so is your spot I'm going to get on
 
yes so is your spot I'm going to get on
the soap box for a second because I've
 
the soap box for a second because I've
been thinking about an article on this
 
been thinking about an article on this
topic but it's it's actually multi-prong
 
topic but it's it's actually multi-prong
so the you're exactly right there is
 
so the you're exactly right there is
this tradeoff between cash and equity in
 
this tradeoff between cash and equity in
which you are taking less cash for more
 
which you are taking less cash for more
Equity ownership and the the you know
 
Equity ownership and the the you know
the recruiting pitch as I've given it a
 
the recruiting pitch as I've given it a
million times to candidate candidates is
 
million times to candidate candidates is
hey you're going to join early and if
 
hey you're going to join early and if
we're successful you're going to have a
 
we're successful you're going to have a
a disproportionately large outcome that
 
a disproportionately large outcome that
is
 
is
true if you exercise your options yes
 
true if you exercise your options yes
and this is the piece that like nobody
 
and this is the piece that like nobody
talks about that I think is actually um
 
talks about that I think is actually um
it really disproportionately affects
 
it really disproportionately affects
early stage employees that do not come
 
early stage employees that do not come
from wealthy backgrounds which it turns
 
from wealthy backgrounds which it turns
out like the majority of early stage
 
out like the majority of early stage
employees don't don't and so I I've told
 
employees don't don't and so I I've told
this story once before but you know when
 
this story once before but you know when
I left door Das it was $70,000 for me to
 
I left door Das it was $70,000 for me to
exercise my shares and I didn't have
 
exercise my shares and I didn't have
$70,000 and so I didn't exercise and
 
$70,000 and so I didn't exercise and
then at IPO that was worth millions and
 
then at IPO that was worth millions and
I think there's there's a couple pieces
 
I think there's there's a couple pieces
on this one there's the post-termination
 
on this one there's the post-termination
exercise window ca ca just like last
 
exercise window ca ca just like last
week said
 
week said
 
not exercising their
 
not exercising their
options uh that's one piece the other
 
options uh that's one piece the other
piece that we never talk about is the
 
piece that we never talk about is the
tax code oh you know the the tax code is
 
tax code oh you know the the tax code is
built in such a way to where if you're
 
built in such a way to where if you're
an investor right you not only can you
 
an investor right you not only can you
get long-term capital gains which is
 
get long-term capital gains which is
taxed at the lower rate than labor which
 
taxed at the lower rate than labor which
is absolutely insane but then in
 
is absolutely insane but then in
addition to that you can get qsbs if you
 
addition to that you can get qsbs if you
invest early such that like the first 40
 
invest early such that like the first 40
to 50 million if you're in there before
 
to 50 million if you're in there before
the the company has $50 million in
 
the the company has $50 million in
assets you get zero tax yeah meanwhile
 
assets you get zero tax yeah meanwhile
if you're an employee working your ass
 
if you're an employee working your ass
off building this compy company you have
 
off building this compy company you have
a massive tax yes even if there's no
 
a massive tax yes even if there's no
liquidity because of the the gain in the
 
liquidity because of the the gain in the
strike price so it's like you're you're
 
strike price so it's like you're you're
screwed from both angles and I don't
 
screwed from both angles and I don't
actually hear about anybody trying to
 
actually hear about anybody trying to
change this and so what's your take like
 
change this and so what's your take like
is it even fixable it doesn't seem like
 
is it even fixable it doesn't seem like
there's any inertia to fix it that's my
 
there's any inertia to fix it that's my
question is what like if I'm listening
 
question is what like if I'm listening
to this episode what do I do do I give
 
to this episode what do I do do I give
more cash less Equity do I offer them to
 
more cash less Equity do I offer them to
pay for their Equity two years in kind
 
pay for their Equity two years in kind
of thing I think there's there's four
 
of thing I think there's there's four
options right one is simply to make it
 
options right one is simply to make it
common practice to extend the exercise
 
common practice to extend the exercise
window to align with it the IPO
 
window to align with it the IPO
timelines of today right there's some
 
timelines of today right there's some
economic trade-off the option pool is
 
economic trade-off the option pool is
going to need refreshing at a faster
 
going to need refreshing at a faster
rate unexercised options aren't going to
 
rate unexercised options aren't going to
go back to the pool there are people who
 
go back to the pool there are people who
would argue that's unfair to those still
 
would argue that's unfair to those still
with the company I don't really think
 
with the company I don't really think
that's a fair argument I think the
 
that's a fair argument I think the
stronger argument against extending the
 
stronger argument against extending the
exercise window would be that there's a
 
exercise window would be that there's a
scenario where companies can't increase
 
scenario where companies can't increase
their pool fast enough because the board
 
their pool fast enough because the board
won't approve it and then they can't
 
won't approve it and then they can't
keep High performers or get new Talent
 
keep High performers or get new Talent
right so that requires companies to be
 
right so that requires companies to be
more thoughtful with their pools earlier
 
more thoughtful with their pools earlier
on and investors to take more dilution
 
on and investors to take more dilution
and investors to take more delution 100%
 
and investors to take more delution 100%
there is a unique idea that I was
 
there is a unique idea that I was
floating around for a while but to your
 
floating around for a while but to your
point about the tax implications no one
 
point about the tax implications no one
we kind of tabled it but I had this idea
 
we kind of tabled it but I had this idea
that specifically for the first 10
 
that specifically for the first 10
employees that you could decrease the
 
employees that you could decrease the
risk for those employees by creating a
 
risk for those employees by creating a
special option pool that seed stage
 
special option pool that seed stage
Founders could leverage to attract early
 
Founders could leverage to attract early
non-founder employees so it would be
 
non-founder employees so it would be
this new class of shares that would
 
this new class of shares that would
provide downside protection and share
 
provide downside protection and share
liquidation preferences with the
 
liquidation preferences with the
investors in a downside scenario because
 
investors in a downside scenario because
if you think if you join a seed company
 
if you think if you join a seed company
and it fails at B there's a selloff or
 
and it fails at B there's a selloff or
an aqua hire whatever it is and the
 
an aqua hire whatever it is and the
investors get taken care of and the
 
investors get taken care of and the
founder gets taken care of and those
 
founder gets taken care of and those
first 10 employees who took all the risk
 
first 10 employees who took all the risk
get nothing right the problem with this
 
get nothing right the problem with this
is it doesn't help with a longer term
 
is it doesn't help with a longer term
exercise problem if the company does
 
exercise problem if the company does
well but I do think it makes it easier
 
well but I do think it makes it easier
for startups to attract top talent
 
for startups to attract top talent
earlier on and sort of there's an
 
earlier on and sort of there's an
economic acknowledgement of the risk
 
economic acknowledgement of the risk
that they took but the problem with it
 
that they took but the problem with it
is that the tax implications of the
 
is that the tax implications of the
special pool of stock for those
 
special pool of stock for those
people is terrible like the increased
 
people is terrible like the increased
tax burden is so high that it it
 
tax burden is so high that it it
actually hurts employees more than the
 
actually hurts employees more than the
economic benefit might actually help
 
economic benefit might actually help
them and so it's hard to get creative
 
them and so it's hard to get creative
about how to incentivize employees
 
about how to incentivize employees
without acknowledging that the taxes are
 
without acknowledging that the taxes are
a problem yep there's one other unique
 
a problem yep there's one other unique
solution which is to like
 
solution which is to like
split your original Equity Grant into
 
split your original Equity Grant into
common and founder preferred where every
 
common and founder preferred where every
employee gets some sort of I was just I
 
employee gets some sort of I was just I
was just gonna bring this up so Howard
 
was just gonna bring this up so Howard
lurman uh who is the uh founder of he
 
lurman uh who is the uh founder of he
was the founder of yex he's now the
 
was the founder of yex he's now the
founder of a company called Rome um I
 
founder of a company called Rome um I
saw him speak last year and he blew my
 
saw him speak last year and he blew my
mind with this idea he was like the
 
mind with this idea he was like the
notion that Founders get this insanely
 
notion that Founders get this insanely
cheap stock to exercise and early
 
cheap stock to exercise and early
employees don't is inherently unfair and
 
employees don't is inherently unfair and
so what he has done for like the first
 
so what he has done for like the first
 
them Founders and given them founder
 
them Founders and given them founder
shares and I I had never heard I never
 
shares and I I had never heard I never
even considered this idea because it's
 
even considered this idea because it's
like it's it's it feels so far out of
 
like it's it's it feels so far out of
left field that you would give
 
left field that you would give
nonfounders founder shares but when you
 
nonfounders founder shares but when you
actually think about the implications of
 
actually think about the implications of
it it is the way to like Bend the rules
 
it it is the way to like Bend the rules
so I'll try my best to to explain this
 
so I'll try my best to to explain this
but you tell me if I miss any gaps so
 
but you tell me if I miss any gaps so
basically um when you get founder shares
 
basically um when you get founder shares
they are insanely cheap to exercise and
 
they are insanely cheap to exercise and
you basically exercise them right away
 
you basically exercise them right away
so any appreciation on those shares you
 
so any appreciation on those shares you
will not pay taxes on until there is a
 
will not pay taxes on until there is a
liquidity event right versus with
 
liquidity event right versus with
options um options typically are more
 
options um options typically are more
expensive and can be very expensive
 
expensive and can be very expensive
especially if you're joining like series
 
especially if you're joining like series
a series B the company's doing quite
 
a series B the company's doing quite
well
 
well
um and most employees don't even have
 
um and most employees don't even have
the opportunity to early exercise those
 
the opportunity to early exercise those
options that's actually something that
 
options that's actually something that
you have to ask for or typically
 
you have to ask for or typically
negotiate and so that's what I learned
 
negotiate and so that's what I learned
from Howard and I was like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
from Howard and I was like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that's a great idea I feel like more
 
that's a great idea I feel like more
Founders need to push it but I don't
 
Founders need to push it but I don't
even know if enough Founders know about
 
even know if enough Founders know about
it know that it's an option the other
 
it know that it's an option the other
thing is with the common shares as they
 
thing is with the common shares as they
exist for employees say the isos that
 
exist for employees say the isos that
you're talking about they don't get the
 
you're talking about they don't get the
opportunity to sell those in future
 
opportunity to sell those in future
fundraising rounds at fair market value
 
fundraising rounds at fair market value
until the company is valued so so high
 
until the company is valued so so high
that it's it's it's almost too late but
 
that it's it's it's almost too late but
Founders can share at or sell at every
 
Founders can share at or sell at every
fundraising round investors can sell at
 
fundraising round investors can sell at
every fundraising round right right and
 
every fundraising round right right and
so and I don't think anyone right now is
 
so and I don't think anyone right now is
feeling bad for successful Founders or
 
feeling bad for successful Founders or
or successful investors right but there
 
or successful investors right but there
is this early population of employees
 
is this early population of employees
that people should be feeling feeling
 
that people should be feeling feeling
bad for I'd like to scratch that no one
 
bad for I'd like to scratch that no one
really know they don't even know about
 
really know they don't even know about
it who does know about this like
 
it who does know about this like
Michelle did you just read about this
 
Michelle did you just read about this
did you think about it at midnight one
 
did you think about it at midnight one
night like is compensia out there
 
night like is compensia out there
telling people this because I've never
 
telling people this because I've never
heard this and I've been working with
 
heard this and I've been working with
capensia for 15 years yeah I mean I
 
capensia for 15 years yeah I mean I
think I read about it I would not say
 
think I read about it I would not say
that I'm an expert in tax law or uh
 
that I'm an expert in tax law or uh
Equity or shares or or any of this stuff
 
Equity or shares or or any of this stuff
but I would say that I'm an expert in
 
but I would say that I'm an expert in
hearing the The Phrase My Equity is
 
hearing the The Phrase My Equity is
broken or I can't afford to exercise and
 
broken or I can't afford to exercise and
so I can see the themes and the trends
 
so I can see the themes and the trends
that suggest there's a real problem here
 
that suggest there's a real problem here
and so I just started reading about what
 
and so I just started reading about what
is what is possible and I started
 
is what is possible and I started
exploring what if we just made a whole
 
exploring what if we just made a whole
new like a whole new type of share like
 
new like a whole new type of share like
what what would that mean but then we
 
what what would that mean but then we
started talking to you know 409a
 
started talking to you know 409a
evaluators and tax people and it was
 
evaluators and tax people and it was
like whoa hold your horses this is
 
like whoa hold your horses this is
actually worse than you think it is and
 
actually worse than you think it is and
I don't think the IRS is into being
 
I don't think the IRS is into being
creative about uh fixing the tax code to
 
creative about uh fixing the tax code to
to to also they're not the 409a people
 
to to also they're not the 409a people
aren't either because they they haven't
 
aren't either because they they haven't
seen it right and because they have this
 
seen it right and because they have this
is what I learned at Carta is it was so
 
is what I learned at Carta is it was so
hard to innovate in the 409a space
 
hard to innovate in the 409a space
because they're just they're pattern
 
because they're just they're pattern
matchers they've only seen what they've
 
matchers they've only seen what they've
seen and so when you're trying to
 
seen and so when you're trying to
innovate they're like well we don't know
 
innovate they're like well we don't know
what that's going to mean for your
 
what that's going to mean for your
valuation and they don't want to deal
 
valuation and they don't want to deal
with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so Kelly when I heard
 
with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so Kelly when I heard
this in November of last year I was like
 
this in November of last year I was like
holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not only is it a great idea
 
holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not only is it a great idea
you literally have a Founder that's
 
you literally have a Founder that's
taken a company public who is saying I
 
taken a company public who is saying I
think this is the way that we should be
 
think this is the way that we should be
doing this and I am personally doing it
 
doing this and I am personally doing it
and every investor who invest ask me
 
and every investor who invest ask me
this question and I say it's the right
 
this question and I say it's the right
thing to do for employees and so again
 
thing to do for employees and so again
huge shout out to Howard lurman who's

this conversation I'd love to cut out
 
this conversation I'd love to cut out
and share with more people because it it

here's the deal and I and I asked
specifically why you know it hasn't
 
specifically why you know it hasn't

things that that's what I'm trying to
 
things that that's what I'm trying to
get at here I think I think Founders
 
get at here I think I think Founders
would do it in two seconds if it was
 
would do it in two seconds if it was
laid out it's just it's a thing it's

founder shares is is my takeway you
 
founder shares is is my takeway you
should demand that in your next
 
should demand that in your next
role see how that goes I I I actually

company Kelly that was less than 20
 
company Kelly that was less than 20
people I think you'd be surprised at
 
people I think you'd be surprised at
that you'd probably be able to get it
 
that you'd probably be able to get it
done I just think nobody asked for this
 
done I just think nobody asked for this
either because how to ask and while
 
either because how to ask and while
we're here Michelle I do have a question
 
we're here Michelle I do have a question

right the HR folks Chief people officers
it's amazing to me because I I mentor
 
it's amazing to me because I I mentor
and Coach a lot of folks during their
 
and Coach a lot of folks during their
offer process what we ourselves don't
 
offer process what we ourselves don't
think about or ask for in these offer
 
think about or ask for in these offer
negotiations and if you had to pick kind
 
negotiations and if you had to pick kind
of one area or one thing that you would
 
of one area or one thing that you would
counsel anyone listening to pay
 
counsel anyone listening to pay
attention to in their own offers what
 
attention to in their own offers what
would that
 
would that
be I think a thing that the exit
 
be I think a thing that the exit
packages specifically around shorter
 
packages specifically around shorter
tenure um pre-negotiate those especially
 
tenure um pre-negotiate those especially
above a certain level I think is an
 
above a certain level I think is an
interesting approach and especially when
 
interesting approach and especially when
you are joining an earlier Stage Company
 
you are joining an earlier Stage Company
when you're those are two separate
 
when you're those are two separate
things right senior at a later company
 
things right senior at a later company
or joining an earlier Stage Company
 
or joining an earlier Stage Company
where there is high risk and in a lot of
 
where there is high risk and in a lot of
cases Founders are new to hiring they're
 
cases Founders are new to hiring they're
not quite sure what they need they make
 
not quite sure what they need they make
a hire they don't exactly know how to
 
a hire they don't exactly know how to
make that person successful so it's a
 
make that person successful so it's a
failure and they want that person to go
 
failure and they want that person to go
and so I think that's an interesting um
 
and so I think that's an interesting um
thing to consider is is sort of
 
thing to consider is is sort of
pre-negotiated exit uh I also think one
 
pre-negotiated exit uh I also think one
of the things we uh did at zenefits
 
of the things we uh did at zenefits
which I thought was interesting was for
 
which I thought was interesting was for
our employee referral program when we
 
our employee referral program when we
early on when we had people uh wanting
 
early on when we had people uh wanting
to negotiate more equity in their offers
 
to negotiate more equity in their offers
we would say we'll give you the equity
 
we would say we'll give you the equity
package we initially offered you and if
 
package we initially offered you and if
you can join us and you can help us hire
 
you can join us and you can help us hire
six amazing people in your first six
 
six amazing people in your first six
months we will give you you're actually
 
months we will give you you're actually
acting like an owner and then we will
 
acting like an owner and then we will
give you more of an ownership stake to
 
give you more of an ownership stake to
align such a idea because you've
 
align such a idea because you've
delivered on something that actually
 
delivered on something that actually
helps the business and so I think those
 
helps the business and so I think those
types of things where there's going to
 
types of things where there's going to
be an ask of you in the business if you
 
be an ask of you in the business if you
can negotiate something around those I
 
can negotiate something around those I
think is interesting too that second
 
think is interesting too that second
piece is such a good idea I have never
 
piece is such a good idea I have never
heard that I
 
heard that I
I do want to come back to pre-negotiated
 
I do want to come back to pre-negotiated
Severance and the look that Kelly gave I
 
Severance and the look that Kelly gave I
know which is because of me by the way
 
know which is because of me by the way
we we argued about this about seven
 
we we argued about this about seven
months ago so when you said that I was
 
months ago so when you said that I was
like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
yeah so let's talk about pre-negotiated
 
yeah so let's talk about pre-negotiated
Seance I've done it twice I've done it
 
Seance I've done it twice I've done it
twice with Executives and it turned out
 
twice with Executives and it turned out
in both of those cases we exited those
 
in both of those cases we exited those
executives in less than a year so again
 
executives in less than a year so again
n of two right very small sample size
 
n of two right very small sample size
but the like the pattern for me was like
 
but the like the pattern for me was like
the people that are
 
the people that are
pre-negotiated their Severance is like
 
pre-negotiated their Severance is like
they're they're already thinking about
 
they're they're already thinking about
leaving like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on
 
leaving like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on
here it feels like a red flag so educate
 
here it feels like a red flag so educate
me as to why that shouldn't be the case
 
me as to why that shouldn't be the case
I mean I hear you say that and I think
 
I mean I hear you say that and I think
yes but why like who has that much time
 
yes but why like who has that much time
that they're like I'm going to go
 
that they're like I'm going to go
through this whole interview process I'm
 
through this whole interview process I'm
going leave my current job I'm going to
 
going leave my current job I'm going to
start a new job and I'm going to think
 
start a new job and I'm going to think
about quitting from day one that just
 
about quitting from day one that just
seems like a you know an awful lot of it
 
seems like a you know an awful lot of it
seems like no one's assuming bad intent
 
seems like no one's assuming bad intent
here Michelle is what it yeah like you
 
here Michelle is what it yeah like you
know and I I think most people have good
 
know and I I think most people have good
intent I would argue and Nolan you're
 
intent I would argue and Nolan you're
never goingon to invite me back but I
 
never goingon to invite me back but I
would argue that there was something
 
would argue that there was something
missing in the interview process there
 
missing in the interview process there
was something missing in the job scope
 
was something missing in the job scope
or enabling them post hire that actually
 
or enabling them post hire that actually
led to them leaving and while I think
 
led to them leaving and while I think
negotiating an exit package should be
 
negotiating an exit package should be
more common practice than it is my guess
 
more common practice than it is my guess
is that they might have been feeling
 
is that they might have been feeling
that too and so
 
that too and so
while you know what I mean it was just
 
while you know what I mean it was just
sort of The Perfect Storm for you in in
 
sort of The Perfect Storm for you in in
both of those cases but I think if you
 
both of those cases but I think if you
run a good process if you hire the right
 
run a good process if you hire the right
person if you know what you want and you
 
person if you know what you want and you
know what success looks like and you get
 
know what success looks like and you get
them in the role the likelihood that
 
them in the role the likelihood that
they're going to join and be like I'm
 
they're going to join and be like I'm
just going to take advantage of this
 
just going to take advantage of this
exit package and start that process all
 
exit package and start that process all
over again feels really really low to me
 
over again feels really really low to me
yeah you're actually right no she's
 
yeah you're actually right no she's
right she's in both of those cases we
 
right she's in both of those cases we
did have gaps in the process and then we
 
did have gaps in the process and then we
ultimately had it it wasn't a role
 
ultimately had it it wasn't a role
change but it was like a responsibility
 
change but it was like a responsibility
changed in both of those cases um and so
 
changed in both of those cases um and so
you're right that that's that is a gap
 
you're right that that's that is a gap
in my remembering of what happened in
 
in my remembering of what happened in
those cases I just remember one case to
 
those cases I just remember one case to
where it was like it literally took an
 
where it was like it literally took an
extra three weeks to negotiate it and I
 
extra three weeks to negotiate it and I
was like this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] outrageous oh
 
was like this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] outrageous oh
that's right you were scarred with the
 
that's right you were scarred with the
process yeah and it was like back and
 
process yeah and it was like back and
forth with that person's lawyer and I'm
 
forth with that person's lawyer and I'm
just like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we doing
 
just like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we doing
here like you need you haven't you
 
here like you need you haven't you
haven't provided an ounce of work and
 
haven't provided an ounce of work and
I'm spending all of my time negotiating
 
I'm spending all of my time negotiating
for when you leave you haven't even
 
for when you leave you haven't even
started and so it just like annoyed me
 
started and so it just like annoyed me
but I do think yeah and I I do think
 
but I do think yeah and I I do think
you're right though Michelle is like we
 
you're right though Michelle is like we
didn't have great processes for either
 
didn't have great processes for either
of those candidates and then I'm also
 
of those candidates and then I'm also
scarred because n of two both of those
 
scarred because n of two both of those
people leave in a year and I'm just like
 
people leave in a year and I'm just like
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we doing there is a
 
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we doing there is a
more positive spin on this which is I I
 
more positive spin on this which is I I
think it's also beneficial instead of
 
think it's also beneficial instead of
pre-negotiate your Severance for the
 
pre-negotiate your Severance for the
average employee to pre-negotiate their
 
average employee to pre-negotiate their
refresh what are the milestones at year
 
refresh what are the milestones at year
one or year two what should my impact be
 
one or year two what should my impact be
like clearly what should my impact be um
 
like clearly what should my impact be um
to to get a refresh that is is
 
to to get a refresh that is is
Meaningful I think it's potentially
 
Meaningful I think it's potentially
interesting and a more positive spin
 
interesting and a more positive spin
instead of joining thinking you're
 
instead of joining thinking you're
leaving it's joining thinking I'm going
 
leaving it's joining thinking I'm going
to crush this and you're going to want
 
to crush this and you're going to want
to keep me so much that it makes sense
 
to keep me so much that it makes sense
for us to do this this has been like my
 
for us to do this this has been like my
favorite episode so far I still have
 
favorite episode so far I still have
like another question for you this is
 
like another question for you this is
great um holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm just going
 
great um holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm just going
to try and like settle myself after
 
to try and like settle myself after
learning so much so far so last question
 
learning so much so far so last question
is you're now an operating partner at
 
is you're now an operating partner at
one of the best early stage VCS in the
 
one of the best early stage VCS in the
world what are the common mistakes that
 
world what are the common mistakes that
Founders make and how can HR and and
 
Founders make and how can HR and and
other operators help these
 
other operators help these
Founders yeah that's a great question
 
Founders yeah that's a great question
I think there are three maybe four but I
 
I think there are three maybe four but I
I'd say there are three mistakes that I
 
I'd say there are three mistakes that I
think Founders make very often the first
 
think Founders make very often the first
one is probably going to feel
 
one is probably going to feel
controversial which is they mistake lots
 
controversial which is they mistake lots
of activity and working long hours for
 
of activity and working long hours for
productivity they glorify the grind of a
 
productivity they glorify the grind of a
startup and I think that's a mask for we
 
startup and I think that's a mask for we
actually don't have operating rigor and
 
actually don't have operating rigor and
I'm I'm this is not really a about the
 
I'm I'm this is not really a about the
downside of long hours more about the
 
downside of long hours more about the
risk that they churn through talent and
 
risk that they churn through talent and
set really bad foundations for how work
 
set really bad foundations for how work
gets done which is going to burn as they
 
gets done which is going to burn as they
scale so that's that's the first one the
 
scale so that's that's the first one the
second thing is I hear a lot of Founders
 
second thing is I hear a lot of Founders
talking about culture and I'm not sure
 
talking about culture and I'm not sure
that they've actually gred onto the fact
 
that they've actually gred onto the fact
that that your your culture is the
 
that that your your culture is the
primary tool to sustain Peak Performance
 
primary tool to sustain Peak Performance
to enable your employees to have an
 
to enable your employees to have an
impact and to do it fairly autonomously
 
impact and to do it fairly autonomously
and to make hard decisions easier and so
 
and to make hard decisions easier and so
I think Founders don't actually
 
I think Founders don't actually
understand why they care about culture
 
understand why they care about culture
and I think they wait too long to codify
 
and I think they wait too long to codify
it and then the last thing and probably
 
it and then the last thing and probably
the most detrimental thing I think is
 
the most detrimental thing I think is
they don't actively reinvent or reinvest
 
they don't actively reinvent or reinvest
in themselves at each stage of growth
 
in themselves at each stage of growth
and so they stay the same person they
 
and so they stay the same person they
were and they don't actually scale with
 
were and they don't actually scale with
the organization in the way in the way
 
the organization in the way in the way
that they need to and I like in terms of
 
that they need to and I like in terms of
how HR helps like I tend to think that
 
how HR helps like I tend to think that
the HR role and the Ops role are kind of
 
the HR role and the Ops role are kind of
like becoming one in a lot of ways and
 
like becoming one in a lot of ways and
so so I will say this to sustain Peak
 
so so I will say this to sustain Peak
Performance you need to know what it
 
Performance you need to know what it
looks like you need to know what matters
 
looks like you need to know what matters
your employees need to know how do I
 
your employees need to know how do I
work on only the things that are going
 
work on only the things that are going
to drive this business forward at any
 
to drive this business forward at any
given time and your guiding principles
 
given time and your guiding principles
should drive that culture and make it
 
should drive that culture and make it
clear what to do when you're faced with
 
clear what to do when you're faced with
a trade-off or a hard decision and I see
 
a trade-off or a hard decision and I see
Founders All the Time create these goals
 
Founders All the Time create these goals
and missions their principles how they
 
and missions their principles how they
want to behave and the minute it becomes
 
want to behave and the minute it becomes
uncomfortable for them to use them they
 
uncomfortable for them to use them they
waver or they make a decision that isn't
 
waver or they make a decision that isn't
actually aligned with principles that
 
actually aligned with principles that
bleeds into the rest of the organization
 
bleeds into the rest of the organization
and creates a lot of uncertainty for how
 
and creates a lot of uncertainty for how
work gets done how decisions are made
 
work gets done how decisions are made
all that stuff and everything slows down
 
all that stuff and everything slows down
to a halt and I think a truly strategic
 
to a halt and I think a truly strategic
R leader who also operates like a CEO
 
R leader who also operates like a CEO
can design HR programs to mitigate this
 
can design HR programs to mitigate this
and can help Founders to minimize the
 
and can help Founders to minimize the
discomfort that comes with those
 
discomfort that comes with those
tradeoffs and specifically as it relates
 
tradeoffs and specifically as it relates
to actively Reinventing or reinvesting
 
to actively Reinventing or reinvesting
in themselves um I wrote this down
 
in themselves um I wrote this down
because it sticks with me Sati Nella
 
because it sticks with me Sati Nella
said this thing about being a CEO which
 
said this thing about being a CEO which
was it's a lonely place you've got to be
 
was it's a lonely place you've got to be
the one to take some risk and that
 
the one to take some risk and that
emanates from your world view as a CEO
 
emanates from your world view as a CEO
you have to have an absolute first class
 
you have to have an absolute first class
view of where the world world is going
 
view of where the world world is going
and I like this because being a CEO is
 
and I like this because being a CEO is
uncomfortable it's lonely you have to be
 
uncomfortable it's lonely you have to be
comfortable taking risks you're doing a
 
comfortable taking risks you're doing a
lot of things for the first time and I
 
lot of things for the first time and I
think early CEOs run the risk of getting
 
think early CEOs run the risk of getting
to a good place in they're learning and
 
to a good place in they're learning and
becoming complacent and not realizing
 
becoming complacent and not realizing
that with each stage of growth their
 
that with each stage of growth their
world is changing their company is
 
world is changing their company is
changing their role is changing where
 
changing their role is changing where
they need to be spending time has
 
they need to be spending time has
changed and if you think about it the
 
changed and if you think about it the
like the first job of a CEO founder is
 
like the first job of a CEO founder is
not very CEO right the number one goal
 
not very CEO right the number one goal
is building something cool and finding
 
is building something cool and finding
people who want to use it they delegate
 
people who want to use it they delegate
nothing they're talking to customers
 
nothing they're talking to customers
they're writing code they're making
 
they're writing code they're making
design decisions they're interviewing
 
design decisions they're interviewing
and hiring every single person that
 
and hiring every single person that
joins and it's not really about building
 
joins and it's not really about building
a company it's just about generating
 
a company it's just about generating
enough demand for your product that you
 
enough demand for your product that you
have to hire more people right but once
 
have to hire more people right but once
you move past that product Market fit
 
you move past that product Market fit
phase CEOs get confused about what their
 
phase CEOs get confused about what their
role is and I have I have this thing I
 
role is and I have I have this thing I
say all the time which is that the CEOs
 
say all the time which is that the CEOs
who need help think they're building a
 
who need help think they're building a
really precious product and for a while
 
really precious product and for a while
they are but the best CEOs realize that
 
they are but the best CEOs realize that
actually building a company and when
 
actually building a company and when
they realize that it becomes clear that
 
they realize that it becomes clear that
they need to step away from a lot of the
 
they need to step away from a lot of the
early CEO activities um and that's hard
 
early CEO activities um and that's hard
and this is where a really strong HR
 
and this is where a really strong HR
leader comes into play helps them do
 
leader comes into play helps them do
that makes them better teaches them
 
that makes them better teaches them
delegating and the last thing I will say
 
delegating and the last thing I will say
because I realized I've been talking
 
because I realized I've been talking
forever is as a CEO delegates there are
 
forever is as a CEO delegates there are
three things they will never delegate
 
three things they will never delegate
culture pushing alignment and vision and
 
culture pushing alignment and vision and
hiring and all of those things that a
 
hiring and all of those things that a
CEO cannot delegate are squarely in the
 
CEO cannot delegate are squarely in the
Wheelhouse of a strong HR leader and an
 
Wheelhouse of a strong HR leader and an
HR leader can help help them with all of
 
HR leader can help help them with all of
those things that always have to be done
 
those things that always have to be done
by them yeah I could not agree more well
 
by them yeah I could not agree more well
well said and your second point about
 
well said and your second point about
helping to codify and build a culture at
 
helping to codify and build a culture at
that time where the CEO moves from
 
that time where the CEO moves from
building a product to building a company
 
building a product to building a company
it is insane how important that is and I
