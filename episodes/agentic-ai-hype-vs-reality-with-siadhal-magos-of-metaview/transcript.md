what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics we are
back with our AI corner with SLE from
Med what's up SLE I'm good man I'm good
how you doing I'm doing all right all
right so we want to talk about agentic
Ai and before you turn the podcast off
because you've heard this a million
times on Twitter and Linkedin and you're
like oh my God uh like my eyes are
glazing over every single time somebody
says something about this what we want
to do today is actually break down like
where is this Tech today where do we
think it's going and what is your job as
a people or HR leader thinking about
agentic AI in your company so SLE what
the hell is agentic AI yeah you to your
point Nolan it has been sort of a word
or a phrase that's been in The Ether for
a couple of years now but really it's
come to sort of be the most prominent
like almost theme for 2025 is agentic AI
because a lot of the foundational models
have fundamentally improved to a point
where agentic workflows are possible
which we'll talk about what they are in
a second but also because they've built
specific products around these agentic
workflows so things like uh chat and
chat GPT you know have operator or on
Claude you have uh browser use where the
AI can go and use your computer as if
it's you know as if it's got its fingers
on your keyboard and its hand on your
mouse so it's really come really come to
prominence because of that and so what I
thought would be a really what I think
is definitely a really good use of time
for folks is to really understand what
is the difference between agentic Ai and
what is the difference between you know
using AI in your workflow or prompting
AI for a certain output where can we
draw lines between those two worker
behaviors I would say like things that
we're going to be doing in the workplace
where does one start and one begin
that's why I think it would be
interesting in terms of sort of the
fundamental difference between agentic
Ai and you know everything we been we've
been doing up till now it's essentially
comes down to that the AI decides for
itself like how many times to try to
achieve an
outcome even the sort of the the the
workflows we had before where it felt
like maybe the products you're using it
felt like there was this autonomy under
the hood within this AI product that
there often wasn't really what it was
was a very sort of um deliberately and
surgically engineered chain of prompts
that the AI would sort of complete on
your behalf whereas now what we're
seeing are things where there's not this
engineered by a human being chain of
prompts under the hood there is
literally just a command maybe an
open-ended command or ask that you give
the AI and it figures out for itself how
to go and do those things and when you
don't have these um sort of under the
hood this chain of prompts it actually
opens up a much bigger surface area of
things that the AI can potentially do
for you and of course therefore the way
you interact with it so yeah we we we'll
get into talking about the way you inter
interact with it in a second but I think
just to really dial in on the difference
between these AI workflows with these
chains of prompts and these these
agentic AIS where there's no chain of
prompts I want to maybe run through a
few examples um so really as I mentioned
everything up to now has been this
either either you literally are going to
something like chat GPT and you're
giving it one prompt you're getting one
answer you're thinking about what that
means you're giving it another prompt
again you can think of a lot of AI
products out there as essentially doing
that on your behalf under the hood where
it's
ask the AI something get an output use
that output to inform the next prompt
and so on and maybe there's two or three
of those in a chain to get you your
output so that could be you know check
this job description for accuracy uh if
it's accurate translate it into Spanish
once it's successfully translated into
Spanish convert the salary into the Euro
or the local C currency or whatever it
might be and it's someone someone some
human being has designed that workflow
it's leveraged this intelligence this
artificial intelligence but it's still
essentially a designed workflow and
that's what we think of as an AI
workflow another example might be um you
know AI please read an email The Prompt
might be read the email I just received
and categorize it as urgent or non-
urgent if it's urgent then outline
potential next steps and once you have
those next steps ping me on slack with
those next steps so to us this felt
totally magical this felt like the AI
had sort of figured all these things out
but actually in reality there were some
you know some smart product people in
eng Engineers somewhere who are
essentially chaining these individual
instances of intelligence together to
help us you know achieve the these
really magical things so really you
needed a set of knowledgeable human
beings to design those rails and the
thing that agentic AI does for us is it
takes away the need for these
intelligent human beings to design these
rails and just gives everyone the
ability to sort of you know ask these
quite open-ended you know questions that
maybe even you don't know how it should
go and Achieve that thing
yeah so help me understand like there's
dissonance here for me so I've recently
tried the chat GPT operator and the
reason I tried it because I I felt like
I was having an emperor has no cloth
momentet of like everybody's using this
now like oh my like you're seeing all of
these grandiose statements about how
this is like changing the game and holy
 and like you know this is replacing
McKenzie analysts for example
so I'll give you the two prompts that I
used the first one was you know we not
not only do I host this podcast you and
I are building a podcast with medavie
and coming up with good questions is
hard it's like what of the hardest
things and so I sent operator down a
path and I said hey I want to know like
the best podcast questions to ask this
person specifically and then also just
kind of do like a broad base like what
are the best questions to ask if I'm
running a you know people Ops and talent
podcast and it came back with like the
most vanilla obvious like you can
ever it it just wasn't interesting at
all I'm like I didn't use any of it
canly so that was thing one and then
thing two is sourcing so I feel like
sourcing this is like an very obvious
use case right which is like okay I'm
hiring for a you know XYZ rooll here's
three candidates that look great like go
get me a list of a hundred people that
might be a fit and it's just not close
yet like it doesn't it's not even close
to what I would expect even a junior
sorcerer to be able to like go develop
and and design for me so I feel like I'm
seeing all this stuff on LinkedIn that
says this thing is the best thing ever
and oh my God like we're getting rid of
junior level roles and then my personal
like my personal experience is not that
so is it a me thing or is the tech just
like not there yet and we're overhyping
I think there's like a there's a little
bit of a you thing I'm sort of laughing
because I remember sort of like years
ago now this is this is not going to
sound like modern technology to most
many many people listening this but like
you know how frustrated do we get when
we don't have access to the internet on
a plane or something and you're
like guy dude do you remember do you
know that like 20 years ago or however
many years ago if we told you you'd be
up in the air over the over a sea and
you could access any piece of
information in the world that's ever
been produced and download any movie and
you're now frustrated that you can't do
that so I would say amazing your
standards are incredibly high in sort of
two years you've gone from thinking it
would be it would be unfathomable that a
machine could do any of these things
anyway to being like thoroughly
unimpressed with the output but I sort
of agree with you and I think
interestingly you're an expert at the
two things you asked the AI to do you
did not Infuse it with as the AI does
not have as much context about what
makes a great podcast as you do it does
not have as much context about what
makes a great you know sourcing strategy
as you do now there will be companies
who will be built around those use cases
right there will be an AI company that
focuses on assisting podcasters to run
great podcasts and again some clever
human beings will Infuse the AI with the
right context to be able to do a better
job there you're using obviously chat
gbt which is a general purpose tool it
has some spikes like it's pretty good
like many Engineers will use it for
programming for example and open AI put
a ton of resources and by that I mean
they literally pay other human beings
Experts gazillions of dollars every year
to essentially review code and help the
AI learn over time and get better at
this thing they're not doing that for
the two examples that you just gave so
literally I think the intelligence of
the system has not been in reinforced
with as much expertise as you have and
so you know congratulations Nolan in
that case you are smarter than jck GPT
and you found like the two maybe only
the two things on the planet that you're
smarter than chat gbt at you found and
well have you have you used it and been
like have you had a wow moment I I have
not actually with track gbt operator but
with um I was I was building sort of
silly fun applications with repet I'm
not a programmer but to go from
literally idea and human prompt to an
application that works that yes totally
every engineer at metav you would be
totally embarrassed to put out a product
like the one that I that rep built for
me but to me as someone who has no
expertise well I not say no expert like
minimal expse and definitely not well
practiced expertise at building software
applications that was a complete
superpower so I think imagine imagine
maybe an equivalent you know Nolan if
you were running your first podcast in
to use Spain again if you were running
your first podcast in Spanish with a
native Spanish speaker and you're like
holy I can't even speak Spanish and
you you turned to chat GPT and said can
you produce me a bunch of questions for
uh uh Spanish historian that I'm
interviewing and they only know Spanish
to the mere fact you get some questions
back you'd be pretty mind blown by and
fact you could run a podcast with those
questions change things so I just think
there's like a mismatch between right
now I don't think this will be the case
between Someone Like You who's an expert
in interviewing and recruiting and
expecting chat BT to be better out of
the gate great that you have those
expectations it's not there right now
but there'll be other cases where it
will be yeah I think what you're getting
at is like we're still in the you know
call it bottom of the first inning of
this thing and you know regardless of
what I'm reading on Twitter or link in
it's still very very early like we're
making these huge engineering leaps
which is really like what's going on
here but there's so much room for
Innovation for purpose-built
companies that can take the large
language models and build on top of them
for a specific use case that's what I
think I'm taking away here you're to
totally and I mean Frankly Speaking the
company I'm building is based on that
idea that having a very much narrower
Focus you can actually accelerate to
what truly you
know extraordinarily productive
recruiting looks like because we you
bound the context so much but uh what I
would say though is I reckon when you
used operator it came back with a set of
questions or it came back with a list of
candidates and it probably asked you
like is this what you're looking for
right uh it didn't ask no it didn't ask
me that it came back and said like
here's what I found interesting okay
that's that that was my experience with
it yeah yeah yeah so what where I was
going with that which uh you know maybe
note to the team at open AI the way that
I would expect that to work the way I'm
expecting more AI workflows to go is you
can either turn up to chat GP something
like a chat GP whatever whatever AI
whatever llm you're using and you can
give it a ton of context about what
let's use the sourcing example this is
what I think great candidates look like
this is what you know these are a 100
example resumés that I really like go
and find me some and it will do a much
better job probably than the thing that
you gave or you can take the approach
you took which was hey find me some
candidates for this type of role it
comes back you know it gives you 10
examples it should be asking you like
listen I don't have much information
here like are these the type of things
you're looking for and you could
literally you know with a purpose-built
UI go through and say yes this is good
yes this is good no this is bad maybe
even you could tell it why they were
good or bad and you would it would learn
and get better so I I do still think the
fundamental technology you used with the
right user experience wrapped around it
would be able to get you to that
Promised Land because it is at the end
of the day frankly far smarter than UI
and everyone else listening to this
listening to this podcast so I think it
could get there I think that's more of
like a ux challenge so I I still think
the excitement is very valid there's
just some ux implications we need to
work out and that will in some cases
that might be done within a generic tool
like Jack gbt and in some cases that
will be always be better done within a
dedicated like B2B product in this case
that other folks build yeah you're
helping me calibrate I think said more
succinctly and directly to me Nolan
garbage in garbage out right like you're
only as good as the prompt so one of the
things I actually would I've been doing
that has been working really well s have
you heard of whisper
flow yeah do you use it yeah yeah as in
the I'm thinking of the speech DET text
yes yeah yes do you use it every day no
I haven't really developed the Habit on
it to be honest I sort of use it when I
remember hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors I must admit I used to believe
that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR that is until my friend
Heather do who leads talented signal
fire told me to check out metav I got
into the product and was like Wow AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversation
like intakes interviews and debriefs
then provides perfectly summarized notes
of everything that was discussed I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently high quality data
from candidate conversations I've been
in debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview and
I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards metav view changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
up join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out medavie head over to metav
view. Heretics to talk to one of Met's
product experts tell them that me and
Kelly sent you or you could just go to
their website and get started for free
you'll be up running and AI enabled in
minutes okay so I've been using this now
I would say
like it's at least 10 times a day and
what I'm finding is that maybe this is
unique to me I don't think it
is I talk so much faster than I type and
I have uninterrupted thoughts when I'm
talking and so what this tool allows me
to do is it essentially I'd say with 97%
accuracy captures what I'm saying in in
my voice and it actually like perfectly
lists it out in text and so when I
finding is like when I'm using chat GPT
now or even when I'm like communicating
with you or other colleagues or whatever
it is I'm immediately like using whisper
flow which then I'm able to just get out
like all of the things that are in my
brain so much
faster and I don't have the limiting
capacity of like oh my God I don't want
to spend 30 minutes writing this email
when I can spend three minutes just
talking it out and then you know call it
a quick minute or two editing and then
it's good to go and so I think I think
what I'm getting from you is is like
garbage in garbage out so you got to
prompt it better but prompting it better
takes more time and you should be using
tools to help you prompt it better like
a whisper flow which I think everybody
should test out because it's
sick I think I I definitely think that
is a that's definitely that's I I think
that's been true for like this whole
time basically this whole if you imagine
like our world started in November 2023
when chat gbt launched like was was was
very was highly usable and effective
like that's always been true frankly so
again I I I want to stress that the new
thing is that okay I totally get it you
weren't impressed with operator but
there is still a massive shift that
occurred there where you know you asked
the AI to um Source you some candidates
if you had have asked chat gbt to do
that even six months ago it wouldn't
even even had had access to like real-
time data about what's on the internet
and it would have asked you like well
you know where do you want me to look
for them and things like whereas
actually now even with this very
ambiguous command that you gave so yes
garbage in in a way it was still able to
go to something and from that something
you can iterate and refine which is
again very analogous to how humans learn
like If you hired a recruiter into your
company who was sort of like fresh out
of high school or something like this
fresh out of fresh out of college they
probably also do a pretty terrible job
in their first first time but you didn't
need to literally tell them like how to
move the mouse on the screen and do this
and you know they at least did something
with some autonomy so I do still think
it's really important and I guess that
one thing i' would also say is one of
the the big shifts with agentic AI is
because often you ask it to do something
one of the downsides to the you know
using a using agentic AI often is that
often it takes a little bit longer to
return you an answer it can actually it
can be quite Meandering in how it goes
and exploring these things which again
is quite human as well sometimes it goes
down dead ends sometimes it goes down
rabbit holes it's like very almost like
comically human in how it goes about
completing these tasks but the really
cool thing is you can see exactly the
thinking uh it's actually not exactly
actually funny enough they producti the
thinking but you can in in conceptually
you can see the thinking of the AI of
how it got to this thing and you can
also correct it on the thinking so again
this is not I don't think what we're
saying is there's some Panacea of now
you just need to like very Blas and sort
of um what's the word I'm looking for
sort of um you know with hardly any
detail say hey do this and it's going to
do a great job that's not where that's
not what we're saying what we're saying
is like if you lean in and I think this
is where now I'm getting getting you now
I guess what you're saying in terms of
garbage in that's true but I don't think
it's just it's not just at the top of
the funnel like you can always this is a
collaboration and you can change tax
halfway through and say you know what
I'm realizing you're not getting it let
me listen you've gone wrong here you
don't want to be looking over here do
this instead you can still engage with
it in that way it's just it's not
forcing you to give it those guard rails
because it has agency it has the ability
to you know at least do something based
on what you've asked it to do yeah the
analog would be if I hired a junior
Sorcerer And they produced what open AI
produced I would just be like this sucks
and then I no longer interact with that
person right which is not what I would
be doing right what I would be doing is
is being like no we're not close here I
expect these the so now take this and do
these three things on top of it and take
another
turn that's actually very helpful for me
and probably helpful for our audience
because one of the things that's
happening right now is we're having to
you said ux earlier right I actually
think What's happen right now is like
we're teaching the human how to operate
the
machine and that's been my issue is like
I don't think I'm very good at operating
the machine yet yeah and in fact like my
expectations are so high because of what
I see on Twitter and Linkedin that I'm
like it should just work yeah
and that's just not where we are we need
to actually like recode our brains and
have lower expectations as we would with
the junior employee but a junior
employee that can get a lot better very
quickly yeah yeah yeah I think it's very
connected to um it's funny like I think
there's another way another way to say
what you said is actually frankly the
opposite of what you said so you said
I'm not really like very good at
operating these machines it's almost
like the machines are now operating less
like a machine and more like a human so
that's like really you've been trained
and so have I in my whole professional
life to operate machines in a way that
suits machines which is it's totally
deterministic if I do this thing this
thing will output instantaneously that
is obviously not that's that's only true
in machine in computer land like that's
not actually how the rest of the world
is and now we're dealing with this
technology that not only do I can I sort
of input whatever type of query prompt
or you know garbage that I want but even
if if I ask that same question the next
day I will get a slightly different
outcome as well so it's probabilistic
instead of deterministic and so that's
something we all have to learn to sort
of get our head around again it's
another reason why you'll get dedicated
dedicated frankly like AI providers for
certain use cases because they will try
and take out as much of that Randomness
for certain workflows as possible where
chap GT is not going to do that because
it's a general purpose tool but again
still fundamentally we have need to
build up that intuition that this is
like a much more organic live
relationship that we're having with
technology that's much more akin to
working with a human and I'll probably
like get people might get sick of
hearing me say it and I'll probably get
sick of saying it I do honestly think
the most the simplest analogy to remind
yourself of is this is very similar to
how human beings both learn and how
human beings operate and so it's much
more it's much more similar to that
that's actually it's a really helpful
frame right it's just like treat it like
a junior employee I guess you could be
meaner to it if you would like to uh
yeah you probably have to say please and
thank you so much but uh I don't know
maybe maybe they will maybe the AI
overlords will be taking this into
account at some point so so be careful
yeah well s this is super helpful for us
um last question for you is like what is
in your daily AI
stack good question so Chad gbt is my
like go-to general purpose chat product
uh I'm pretty big on like harnessing all
the conversational data I use and I
obviously use my own product for that
and we use that both for our recruiting
but also for our other meetings as well
um uh yeah I've started to play much
more with as I mentioned I've been like
almost like also I I have to spend time
honing my intuition too so I've been
spiking a lot recently on uh playing
with repet which is a great tool you
should check it out just to help you
from like just a few words to like
coaching you through literally deploying
software not even coaching you through
frankly in many ways just doing it for
you so that's uh I wouldn't quite call
it daily at this point but that's pretty
pretty
frequent notion AI is really good to be
honest with you from a like some folks
will be using like dedicated AI for
knowledge almost like Knowledge
Management we don't do that we use or I
use notion really because most of our
our internal company knowledge is in
notion and so I use notion AI a lot as
well okay the only other thing I'd add
to what you just said is whisper flow
like I really do believe yeah this has
been this has been a magical experience
for me I am finding that like I am much
more of a an orator
communicator and I feel like most
actually like people and talent folks
probably are like me and so they should
like 100% check this out and then our
commitment is is like let's learn
together as a community so like in the
comment section what are you guys using
every day like and are you having
actually like magic moments with these
products please share those in the
comments so we can all continue to learn
yeah yeah that's a great shout one thing
I would I would say on whisper flow
though is sorry to sort of derail at the
last minute there but is uh I imagine
it's better suited to people that work
from home a lot just from like uh you
know I spent all day in the office today
with my team you know it's still there
still is a little bit of weirdness
around you know hey someone just piped
up and they turns out they weren't
talking to me they were talking to their
computer you know it's okay so I
actually I got over that okay so like I
disagree with you and uh God I'm
forgetting who maybe it was George Mack
who's an amazing follow on Twitter who
was talking about this but he was saying
he would walk around
Austin literally just like talking to
chat GPT this is like the The Voice
version of chat GPT and this is how he
brainstorms and comes up with the
Articles and he said I know I look crazy
and I don't give a um because it
works so well so I agree with you there
is like that little bit of like a
weirdness thing but especially if you're
like in in recruiting like you're
typically on the phone every day anyway
so you know who knows who the hell
you're talking to yeah yeah true so all
right everybody let us know what you
think in the comments and again please
add in what tools you're using so we can
all continue to learn HR Heretics is a
