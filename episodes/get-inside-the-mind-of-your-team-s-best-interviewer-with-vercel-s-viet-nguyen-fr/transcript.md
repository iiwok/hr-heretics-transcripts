that me and Amna have been talking about
that me and Amna have been talking about
 
that me and Amna have been talking about
is we care so much about talent density

Door Dash around the same time. Let me
Door Dash around the same time. Let me
 
Door Dash around the same time. Let me
go ping this employee. It's like, "Hey,
go ping this employee. It's like, "Hey,
 
go ping this employee. It's like, "Hey,
what do you think of Nolan?" Thumbs up,
what do you think of Nolan?" Thumbs up,
 
what do you think of Nolan?" Thumbs up,
thumbs down. And like keep it really
thumbs down. And like keep it really
 
thumbs down. And like keep it really
light. And also the I don't know, like I
light. And also the I don't know, like I
 
light. And also the I don't know, like I
don't know this person is is actually a
don't know this person is is actually a
 
don't know this person is is actually a
good option too, right? or it's an
good option too, right? or it's an

treat it as more so a a net for positive
treat it as more so a a net for positive

reject people because they don't know
reject people because they don't know
 
reject people because they don't know

somebody. Obviously that's not the case,
 
somebody. Obviously that's not the case,
but it's just like how do we get the
but it's just like how do we get the
 
but it's just like how do we get the
people who are high signal to the top of
people who are high signal to the top of
 
people who are high signal to the top of
the list and act on those people first.
the list and act on those people first.
 
the list and act on those people first.
And so now this is like fully automated
And so now this is like fully automated
 
And so now this is like fully automated
and now when anyone applies it looks at
and now when anyone applies it looks at
 
and now when anyone applies it looks at
our entire database, see if they know
our entire database, see if they know
 
our entire database, see if they know
somebody at the company, we ping them,
somebody at the company, we ping them,
 
somebody at the company, we ping them,
try to get early signal, recruiter gets
try to get early signal, recruiter gets
 
try to get early signal, recruiter gets
that ping and then goes and like moves
