What's up everybody? Over the next few
weeks, we're bringing you some Heretics
 
taboo topics that are core to navigating
the CPO seat. Today we're revisiting an
early conversation about how to fire
seuite executives that we had with CJ
from the Run the Numbers podcast. Look,
if you're in this business long enough,
you're either going to have to fire an
executive or you're going to be the one
getting fired. That's just reality.
What started as a simple question turned
into one of our most candid discussions
about severance packages, golden
parachutes, and layering. Share this
with anyone who needs to hear it. Let's
get into it. Welcome to the Run the
Numbers podcast. I'm lucky to be joined
today with the HR heretics themselves,
Nolan and Kelly. What's up, guys? What's
happening? What's up, CJ? So, I'm going
to come straight from the top ropes on
this one. If I'm a CEO or a CFO, what's
the best way to approach exiting a
member of my seuite? What's the what's
the first step I should take when I
think it's time to make a move?
Yeah. Um, listen, the first step
hopefully is that you've been talking
with that executive. I mean, that's the
ideal is that the executive knows that
it's not smooth sailing. Maybe you've
had some disagreements or some feedback
chats. I mean, they happen in different
ways, but it's usually pretty direct,
right? Um, so ideally that's the first
step is that you're having those
conversations and they're just not
comfortable. And execs are usually
hopefully adults at that point and they
lean in like listen should we have a
different type of conversation or not.
It's not one of those surprise you're on
a pip type situations. The second thing
I'd say is the first step is for that
CEO to talk to the board. Um maybe not
every board member and tsunami out like
wildfire but usually an early investor
or a trusted board member. They're
having that conversation as a heads up
and getting advice. Yep. I agree with
Kelly. I would also say I have a general
rule of thumb which is to treat others
the way that you want to be treated. And
so if you are going to terminate an exec
and the decision has been made, I think
it's really clear after you've been
delivering feedback that in the
conversation with the exec, you state,
look, the decision has been made. We're
going to part ways. And then the nuance
really begins. But as Kelly said, if
you're not communicating feedback, we're
having an entirely different
conversation. I want to drill into what
you said there, Nolan. You you kind of
framed it as a decision that was made
and now we can talk about why. Is that
an imperative way to frame it up? I
absolutely think so. But to anchor on
what Kelly said, you need to first be
giving feedback along the way, right?
And so, as is the case, I don't think
executive departures are that much
different than regular employee
departures. Okay? And so, when you are
terminating somebody, you don't walk
into that conversation
expecting to like come to a different
outcome. You're walking to that
conversation with a decision being made.
And then it's, hey, how do we frame the
comm's plan? Let's talk about
compensation.
Uh let's talk about the transition
period. There's a ton of nuance there,
but the first step is is after we have
delivered feedback, we've made a
decision, we clearly communicate the
decision to that person and then work
through everything else. There's three
kind of points on a continuum, no pun in
my opinion, how this happens in my
experience. Right. The first one, CJ, is
after the skies haven't been clear and
sunny for a little bit. I mean, everyone
kind of can see that, feel that. That
executive might lean in and say, "Look,
CJ, what's the deal here? Is this not
working out?" Like, "Am I gonna get f?"
Like, they will just lean in and ask the
question. Which is great. The second is
if those two come to a conclusion
together, ideally, like, this isn't the
right thing. Let's focus on the how now,
the comp, the comms, right? That is the
best because it it's not as stressful.
It's not as time boxed or time bound.
and they work together on that plan. And
then the third is when that executive
just needs a 2x4 over the head. And that
is where you see like the quick like rip
and replace and everyone's frantically
going around the comm's plan and that's
the worst because it's like no huddle
offense at that point is usually more
disorganized and very stressful. Yeah.
Molly Graham told us this, Kelly, and I
actually, this is my philosophy as well,
which is the best way to terminate
somebody is for them to quit. That's
correct. And that means you've been
delivering a ton of feedback. They know
exactly where they stand and they could
just opt out of the company. I've
actually found in most cases, I'd say
 
ends up quitting. And to Kelly's point,
that 2x4 is very, very rare and actually
shows that somebody lacks complete
self-awareness if you are delivering
legit feedback along the way. Can I
offer a potential fourth one? And this
is from just the outside. I've observed
a really hard one and why I asked I
think no one around is it a discussion
versus a decision? And that's when the
company is doing really well, but growth
is outstretching talent and you need to
bring in someone more senior. Not
necessarily that the person hasn't done
a good job. Let's say they've gotten the
company $10 million and they're really
proud of that or 15 or 20, whatever it
may be, but you need the next 18 months
of growth leader for that position. Is
it's a slightly more nuanced example,
but have either of you had to deal with
that kind of tricky situation where it's
more a result of success than failure?
For sure. I usually with someone like
that and they're great, you want to keep
them. M you want to retain them and have
them stay within the organization.
Usually they get layered right
underneath a new leader and that that's
either someone's like I'm in and I I see
that opportunity or sometimes the ego
gets in the way or it's not explained
very well and they opt out right but but
that success ideally the world now gets
bigger. So it's not that their role gets
smaller, it's actually getting bigger.
It's just a different structure. I think
that that frame is meant to be genuine,
Kelly, but I think can sometimes be
total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Somebody once told me,
"First impressions with executives are
everything." I think first impressions
with humans are everything. And the
specific example this person used as we
were talking about somebody who had been
layered and I was interviewing them for
a leadership role on my team. They said,
"Look,
this person came in pretty junior and
pretty immature and then grew a ton
during their tenure here."
But our CEO can only remember the first
conversation they ever had. And the the
metaphor he used is like it's like you
show up to a family reunion and
everyone's like, "Oh, it's little
Nolan." And you're like, "I'm an adult
here." Like, "What are we talking
about?" And so CJ, I think the the
question is um have we been actually
delivering feedback and watching this
person grow and do we believe that they
can get to the next step? And if so,
then like let's deliver them feedback.
Let's get them a coach or adviser like
let's help them get there. That's a
separate discussion versus you're not
going to make it. I've already decided
we're going to layer you. That's still a
decision conversation. And I think how
you handle that nuance to to Kelly's
point will decide if that person stays
or leaves. I I wanted to I wanted to go
back to something that you had said,
Kelly, around talking about the
compensation side of things when you
have the conversation with an exec who's
departing. How much of that is fully
baked once you go to discuss that with
the exact say what the number of months
you're going to pay them out? How what's
going to happen to their stock? Is that
already fully decided or is that part
still part of the discussion? We know
they're leaving.
I this will be a good topic. No, this is
a this is a spicy one. And and there
there is no response. Like there's
there's no canned response, right? Like
some executives don't trust their
freaking CEO and they're like, "I'm not
going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] resign because then I
resign. I get screwed. I don't get you
don't get severance. I don't get I don't
get any of this stuff, right?" I think
that is awful. And I think, you know,
contracting through and having that
discussion without the fear of getting
screwed over like that's where these
things happen. I've been given that
advice on two occasions by execs, right,
wrong or indifferent. They said, "CJ,
never quit. get you want to get fired.
And I said that is morbid. I don't know
if I want to get fired and how that
feels. But they said compwise that's the
right thing to do. Well, it it's also
true that if you end up as an exec, the
most likely way you leave the company is
by getting fired. So, let me just state
that. Say more on that, too. That's just
it. Look, it's it's just the reality of
when you when you ascend all the way to
the seauite, the most likely way you
depart is via termination. And it's
because of what you said, CJ, which is
like most execs aren't going to quit
because they want to make sure that they
get severance. And usually exec exec
severance packages are they can be very
very lucrative. So, let me just say one
thing, which is I have done this twice
in my career with with two different
execs. One of my biggest red flags is
when an exec pre-negotiates their
severance package
and they put it into their offer letter.
Okay? And in both of those cases,
those execs were terminated. And so I
it's a it's a small end count, but for
me one of my bigger red flags is when an
exec pre-negotiates severance because
it's like well what do we like the whole
goal is for you to be successful here.
Um and then if it's not like we all act
as good actors all of us have
reputations on the line and we treat
others the way that we want to be
treated. But I'll tell you that that's
one thing I've seen two of two and count
as small but when you pre-negotiate
severance never a good look.
I don't agree that everyone's a good
actor though like I want that right I'm
between us two null and I'm the polyiana
little everyone everyone's going to be
good and like that that doesn't always
happen and I will be honest when I came
into Pendo they do not have this um and
Todd said the same thing well what why
do we what if you're not performing we
should you know and I agree with that
but it's not just about that right if
you look at what these execs are doing
they're taking a big risk it is a risk
and everyone's taking a risk on joining
a company. It's like it's agnostic of
exec or director or senior IC.
Everyone's taking a risk. It's risk.
It's riskier. Listen, I was a part of
GitHub the first what X weeks CEO
founder out big upheaval. Like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
changes, but it changes if you're an
employee. Like I I don't I I I think
execs get put on a pedestal and I don't
agree with it. and and a lot of these
like a lot of company here's a dirty
secret employment litigation
at the exec level is out of control and
a lot of times these execs that are
getting terminated are holding the
company hostage with some sort of
employment suit that they've made up
post termination and what most companies
do is they settle to make it go away
like that is absolutely happening and it
happens all the time and CEOs that that
are listening to this are probably
nodding their head in agreement because
it's crazy, especially the first time
that you go through it. But like I don't
I don't agree that execs are like some
special breed of person that deserve
special treatment outside of everyone
else in the company, especially with
severance. I agree they're not some
special breed of person. The other the
other piece of it is if I join a new
company, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hits the fan, like boom,
two months, like three, four months
later, I'm out of a job. Like it
arguably takes me longer to find the ne
next right thing than an SDR. That's
true. That that I think is what I was
meaning by that risk. Like of course
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens. Yeah. But it's harder to
find the it's like a more of a needle in
the hay stack situation than again an
SDR. And this shit's happening with
individual contributors too, Nolan. Like
people are smart now. Like the the
litigation. But is that right? Are so
are you saying that you guys
pre-negotiate severance? No, we don't
negotiate it. It's just like, hey, if
these things are to be true, not if you
get fired like if something happens and
out it's out of your control, we'll help
you out for three or six months while
you figure it out. Okay. So So kind of
similar to what Netflix did then. So
basically Netflix said, "Hey, it's it's
it's top performance and if not, it's a
generous severance package and everyone
gets this the generally the same
severance package." That's kind of what
you're saying. That's correct. That
makes sense. I'm torn because I see I
see both sides in the sense that let's
say I'm an SDR, I get fired. I have a
lot less savings to fall back on than an
exec who's been doing it for 10 years
and can afford to take a break. But at
the same time, the surface area for me
to have a soft landing at another
company is a lot wider in the sense that
there are more SDR roles out there than
there are CMO roles at series C through
D companies in the fintech space. So two
things, a lot of IC's do get severance.
So it's not like they don't get a
padding like two weeks or four weeks or
six weeks. I mean, but I would also
challenge that execs have money.
Yeah.
I got this.
Isn't it funny that they get the biggest
eat a lot? Yeah, they get the biggest
payouts, but they have the most money.
It's like when you get famous and they
start comping you for dinner. At least
that's what I hear. And it's like, well,
I can finally afford this now. And
people are giving me free stuff. Look, I
I I I do agree. I I think there are
execs out there that are like, "Give me
the sun, moon, and the stars." And think
about all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And it has gotten
out of control. I think actually the
macro environment has helped like
control a lot of that and dumb it down
because it it was getting to be pretty
pretty crazy.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talented signal fire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metave is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. MeteView changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metaview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metave. Head over to metav.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
When you say pretty crazy, and we can
keep this off the record if if you two
want, and you don't need to say what
company or position it relates to, but
what's the largest golden parachute
you've ever seen? I've seen 12 months
before. Oh, that's not that bad. Well,
if you want to get really spicy, I've
seen 24 months when you throw in
long-term disability and all this other
stuff into the mix or short-term
disability. So, if I'm making 300K as an
exec, like 600K in cash guaranteed,
plus equity vesting, uh, the equity
vesting is something that is not
pre-done. So, that that tends to be a
thing to be honest with you. You have
it's a conversation. So, there's
different levers, right? There's there's
equity acceleration situations. There's
t window exercise timeline extensions.
There's you want to throw garden leave
into the mix. There's garden leave to
elongate things like vesting or cliffs
benefits.
All these things are like ingredients of
a cake. And each cake is a little the
only thing that I've seen like really
is is the is the severance, right? is
the salary. Like everything else tends
to kind of, you know, not deviate too
far, but it's not pre-done. They're all
different levers, CJ, is the way to
think about it. Yes. Ultimately in
service of the outcome and so typically
the CHRO and the CEO will have a
conversation, and I've had this
conversation, and it typically goes from
my standpoint, what is the outcome we
want?
And if the outcome is I want them gone
yesterday, then we think about different
levers. If the outcome is I deeply care
about this person, um I would really
appreciate them to transition the team,
then that comes with a different set of
levers and often can include which Kelly
did not include as part of her her
toolkit. Some people stay on as
adviserss.
Yes. And then and then that you could
talk about equity continuing to vest and
those sorts of things, but it really
comes down to what does the CEO want as
the first principle and then what levers
are available to us and then
conversations with that exec. Yes. This
is why it's it's very important if
you're an exec like to to be mature
about these things, right? And and like
as much as you can and work with not
kind of push up against or flare out. I
mean,
so I just think it's important because
these things generally come down to a
conversation. But CJ, you asked a
question and I want to answer it
directly. Yeah. Which is what's the
biggest I've seen? What's what's the
biggest sticker price? Yeah. So, not I
not personally, but a friend
had an exec file a uh wrongful
termination suit and they settled for 10
million. That's it's a big number. How
often do you see equity being
accelerated upon a termination? Is that
pretty rare? Is is equity acceleration
only reserved, do you think, for
acquisitions? I I have rarely seen
equity acceleration in in exec exits. Um
single double triggers, yes.
Acquisitions, yes. Um more commonly, the
exercise window is extended usually one
to two years, which is why I have a very
strong opinion on this. I I think the
 
think that that needs to change and I
don't know why it hasn't. I'll tell you
why it hasn't. I'd love to hear it.
Because that equity is going back into
the pool and execs get the largest slice
of equity and boards don't want the
Lucian.
That's why the 90-day PTE still exists
today even after what was it? Pinterest
that went to 10 years, Airbnb went to 10
years. At Cardo, we actually had we had
um your tenure. So like if you were
there for two and a half years, you get
two and a half years for your PTE, you
know, but the re the real reality is
after being in these discussions, boards
care deeply about dilution and
specifically with exec equity, which is
a huge portion of that pool. Boards want
that back in the pool. So funny, you
know, it's just such a it's just so
funny how everything nets out because
you know I'm not I've seen known so many
people over the years that literally are
staying for that and they're not doing
much and so like the value they're
creating for these board members is is
just less than if they could just
exercise with some of it some of it goes
back in give it to someone new I mean
it's just it's wild it does create
perverse incentives for sure wild I love
that you hit on that because rest invest
is real in in the valley where people
will chill out. Uh, in the show Silicon
Valley, Big Head, he's chilling on the
roof and he's just resting investing.
They're grilling out every day and
hanging out. Maybe that's like taking it
to another extreme. But you do have
people that are maybe trying 80% 70% as
hard as they were before just watching
the calendar. I I've seen it personally.
Um, from my own view is like I I I'm a
binary person. I'm like all in or all
out. And so that's like never resonated
with me. Uh probably for the detriment
of my own bank account. But you know, I
will say that
tech is a game. Like we're all we're all
playing a game. And some people play
this game to an expert level. And that
is one I I give people credit who can
just continue to hang around and
continue to get paid even though it's
not the best thing for the company
because they're looking out for their
own self-interests. And I think that is
a failure of the management team,
specifically the CEO and the board when
that is happening and they're not doing
anything about it. I agree. I'm more
similar to you, Nolan, in the sense that
I'm an on andoff switch and it eats at
my soul just to kind of chill or or not
try as hard because I'm always thinking,
well, what could I be doing if I was
going 100 miles per hour? Totally.
Life's too short. I I wanted to quickly
define a couple things for people
listening. So, what Kelly, you use the
term garden leave. What is garden leave?
Yeah. So, it's it's basically putting
someone on life support, so to speak,
right? They're they're not working.
They're not doing anything. They're
They're essentially gone, CJ. Except for
on the books. Does it only happen for
CFOs? Because I've only seen it at a
prior company for a CFO. No. No way.
Absolutely. Because garden leave is a
popular term also in the finance
industry within investment banking. Like
if you leave one company and go to
another or if you're like a bond trader.
I had a friend who was on garden leave
for the whole summer and he was getting
paid because they didn't want him to
have I don't know trade secrets or
something to go to a competitor. Oh,
interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If a CEO
gets fired, like does that make that VC
look like they're I don't know, don't
take money from them. Is it a scarlet
letter to some? I think it I think it
depends. I was referencing earlier on
like again 2015 20 it kind of did,
right? Like founders
did not want to be controlled, right?
and and some of these VCs, they had
reputations of having a very strong hand
and
kind of,
you know, prescribing certain things or
being too and I think I I saw it
swinging the other way a bit where it
was very founder friendly because he
didn't want to have a reputation of
being like that. It's kind of like a
back channel. Don't work with them.
They're right. And that that was a
thing. The uh you just have to look at
history though, CJ. So like this used to
happen all the time in the '9s and early
 
step back and looked at the data and the
data was like oof we replaced the
founder we thought this company was
going to go up into the right and they
flatlined or died or didn't have the the
ideal outcome that they wanted. Um, but
then what you saw in the 2010s is what
Kelly's referring to, especially at the
top tier companies, founders got smart
and didn't put their livelihoods and
jobs into the hands of the board. They
actually removed it by having super
voting shares. Correct. And so the board
couldn't really remove them. Multiple
vote. Multiple votes. And we're only a
couple of days, you know, post Sam being
departed at OpenAI. So whenever this
comes out, there may be more
information, but you know, one of the
best takes I I saw on Twitter was like,
"This is why you saw so many founders
negotiate super voting shares, so the
board couldn't do this to them." I saw
that tweet, too. It was like Evan
Spiegel and Mark Zuckerberg's super
voting shares looking pretty good right
now. Exactly. Okay, the last one I
wanted to hit on. So, we started the
call with me asking for advice. I'm
asking for advice again in in a
different vein. So, if I am in this game
long enough, inevitably I could be the
one who's getting fired. If I don't want
to be left in the lurch and I'm getting
on the phone with someone like either of
you, how should I how should I go
through that call? Yeah. Look, I again,
I think the goal is the conversation,
right? It's it's
referencing the blood, sweat, and the
tears that you gave to that company and
that founder. It's asking to be treated
fairly. It's asking to be a part of the
messaging plan and to help drive that
plan and to have a reasonable bridge to
the next opportunity.
And listen, I mean, founders don't want
a lot of drama and turbulence. Frankly,
they're not that great at this stuff.
They don't want to spend their time on
it. They're uncomfortable with it. It's
like, so the easier you can make it on
them and work with them, the better. I
would view it as a series of
conversations
and as so first conversation is you're
getting news that you're being departed.
I think it's really important to act
professionally to be as non-emotional as
you possibly can and then to ask to
collect your thoughts and then to have a
separate conversation.
Then you go away, you, you know, break
some glass against the wall, get all of
your emotion out, and then talk to
friends and start getting advice. Um,
and typically what that advice is going
to be is is like, hey, what really
matters to you? And you have to do some
deep reflection on that. Um, for some
people, the comm's plan really matters.
I've actually come around on this. I
used to believe I did not love execs
designing their own comm's plan uh for
terminations and I was totally wrong
about that. And the reason why is is
because for some people their ego is the
number one thing they're optimizing for.
And it's if you could just solve for
that by letting them design it and then
you reviewing it, great. Like who gives
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if they say that they're leaving
on their own accord? It doesn't matter
to business operations. And ultimately I
found like people always find out
anyways as it relates to comp. Um it's
it's very similar to the advice that I
give when somebody is negotiating an
offer which is you know you want to hear
what the company has to say first. So
let them go first versus you being the
person that anchors and then using that
as the starting point to then try and
negotiate up uh to ensure that you're
doing what's right for yourself and also
just protecting yourself. Um, and again,
it really does, you should be designing
around what you're optimizing for,
understanding you're not going to be
able to pull all the levers you want.
Two, two ads I would have there is yes
on asking for multiple conversations.
And with that, like asking for this to
be between like confidential until
you've worked out your negotiation plan,
your package, and the comm's plan.
because once the fire goes out and
everyone knows that CJ is going and you
have no plan or it kind of can backfire.
Um I could not agree more on the
messaging that has like been my number
one thing that people have asked for is
is controlling that narrative. It is it
is paro chart the most important for
people. Isn't that crazy that that's
like the same same color? I've noticed
the same thing is like people care more
about that than they do about severance.
Well, I mean, it's like like we started
this conversation. They got to go to the
next company. There's going to be
referrals, back channels, there's an
email out, they got fired. That's not
really helpful. Even if that doesn't go
anywhere, it's in their mind from a
confidence perspective. Um, now on the
flip side, and I get this, I empathize.
I've had CEOs that are like, "Fuck that.
I don't want people thinking executives
are walking out of here and like we're
losing people. this is a performance
issue or this was a violation and I want
the company to know that. I want them to
know we made a hard decision. So, I have
run up against that which I understand.
I'm like going through my mind now all
these slack goodbyes that I've seen not
knowing that it was the exact word. I
didn't know that was a lever in the
toolkit. I never knew people were asking
for that. You're saying it's the most
common. Let me see if I get the
bullseye. The common one is personal
time with family. Yes, it's always that.
And if it's a or uh health issues, but
usually yeah, it's personal time with
family. Yeah, all that shit's
orchestrated. Sorry to to pop the bubble
of uh not knowing.
That's wild.
No, everyone finds out. I'm like the one
guy who's like, I didn't know that was
going on behind the scenes.
 
An iceberg has a below the water part.
I think that was a good one to end on.
Thank you both so much for making me
smarter and uh this was a juicy one. I
think people are going to like this.
Awesome. Thanks for the time, CJ.
Thanks, CJ. Thanks.
