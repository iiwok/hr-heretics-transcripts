to understand your philosophical view
yeah you know I think if you have been
 
yeah you know I think if you have been
the person who's had to make the call on
 
the person who's had to make the call on
whether or not to do layoffs you are
 
whether or not to do layoffs you are
probably a little more sensitive to what
 
probably a little more sensitive to what
does that mean for the culture what does
 
does that mean for the culture what does
that mean for the company you know sort
 
that mean for the company you know sort
of um and in in my
 
of um and in in my
opinion um the experience I had at Zinga
 
opinion um the experience I had at Zinga
I very much took it that it was my
 
I very much took it that it was my
responsibility and my failure
 
responsibility and my failure
as a leader that we had gotten to the
 
as a leader that we had gotten to the
point where we needed to do layoffs and
 
point where we needed to do layoffs and
I and I say that because I had for
 
I and I say that because I had for
months been sort of saying like I think
 
months been sort of saying like I think
we have too many people I don't know
 
we have too many people I don't know
what everybody's doing I think we're
 
what everybody's doing I think we're
hiring too quickly um and I couldn't get
 
hiring too quickly um and I couldn't get
any of the other leaders to listen to me
 
any of the other leaders to listen to me
and to to stop hiring and so you know
 
and to to stop hiring and so you know
the first time you go through that and
 
the first time you go through that and
you own it and you are you know taking
 
you own it and you are you know taking
responsibility for you know sort of
 
responsibility for you know sort of
being the person who made the wrong call
 
being the person who made the wrong call
the race to the bottom commentary was a
 
the race to the bottom commentary was a
little bit more
 
little bit more
around I think there is a lot of CopyCat
 
around I think there is a lot of CopyCat
in Silicon Valley which is one company
 
in Silicon Valley which is one company
starts to do it and then every other
 
starts to do it and then every other
company thinks like oh am I missing out
 
company thinks like oh am I missing out
on something and not just layoffs I
 
on something and not just layoffs I
think this goes across the board on lots
 
think this goes across the board on lots
of topics but you know oh I can do it
 
of topics but you know oh I can do it
too the other distinction you should
 
too the other distinction you should
make here is that there are two
 
make here is that there are two
different populations there's a
 
different populations there's a
population of businesses that absolutely
 
population of businesses that absolutely
needed to do layoffs like I think you do
 
needed to do layoffs like I think you do
layoffs if you really have to do it to
 
layoffs if you really have to do it to
for your business to survival you are
 
for your business to survival you are
not going to necessarily have a business
 
not going to necessarily have a business
you know I think Airbnb when they were
 
you know I think Airbnb when they were
at the beginning of the pandemic I think
 
at the beginning of the pandemic I think
they actually were in that situation
 
they actually were in that situation
where they you know they were life or
 
where they you know they were life or
death I think there are a lot of other
 
death I think there are a lot of other
businesses that are at the height of
 
businesses that are at the height of
their earnings um they are seeing record
 
their earnings um they are seeing record
Revenue quarters and yet they are laying
 
Revenue quarters and yet they are laying
off you know High numbers of employees
 
off you know High numbers of employees
and at the same time it doesn't feel
 
and at the same time it doesn't feel
like anybody's taking any responsibility
 
like anybody's taking any responsibility
or accountability for how did they get
 
or accountability for how did they get
so large that they needed to do these
 
so large that they needed to do these
types of things so I think there's such
 
types of things so I think there's such
a distinction between a layoff right and
 
a distinction between a layoff right and
maybe I'm just old now but a layoff
 
maybe I'm just old now but a layoff

about the process so Nolan at the very
 
about the process so Nolan at the very
start of this you said like the rolling
 
start of this you said like the rolling
layoffs piece I think that part is
 
layoffs piece I think that part is
exceptionally harmful to a culture I
 
exceptionally harmful to a culture I
think if especially for those big big
 
think if especially for those big big
companies they have a lot of people they
 
companies they have a lot of people they
could plan for hey this is the date
 
could plan for hey this is the date
we're going to execute on this date um
 
we're going to execute on this date um
we're going to tell people when it's
 
we're going to tell people when it's
done we're going to give them you know

and these are the same companies that
 
and these are the same companies that
just a year or two ago were talking
 
just a year or two ago were talking
about mental health of our employees is
 
about mental health of our employees is
important and the emotional health of
 
important and the emotional health of
our employees is important and they
 
our employees is important and they
still do it some of them which really
 
still do it some of them which really
it's the hypocrisy of the message um
 
it's the hypocrisy of the message um
that they could really be thoughtful
 
that they could really be thoughtful
around what they're doing in the how
 
around what they're doing in the how
that they're doing and that's what I
 
that they're doing and that's what I
think is really frustrating more than
 
think is really frustrating more than
anything else um and and they feel you
 
anything else um and and they feel you
know and to feel like people are not
 
know and to feel like people are not
taking any responsibility or
 
taking any responsibility or
accountability for having let that
 
accountability for having let that
happen and to your point point I mean if
 
happen and to your point point I mean if
there's rolling layoffs and you're
 
there's rolling layoffs and you're
thrashing and it's I mean and a company
 
thrashing and it's I mean and a company
survives that and it it's doing well
 
survives that and it it's doing well
those survivors are like you don't know
 
those survivors are like you don't know

shouldn't do it and you know I lost the
battle and I don't think that was the
 
battle and I don't think that was the
battle I was willing to quit over at the
 
battle I was willing to quit over at the
time and I think it was the right call
 
time and I think it was the right call
like I don't think I should have quit
 
like I don't think I should have quit
over that but I was then had to be the
 
over that but I was then had to be the
messenger who had to go and do that and
 
messenger who had to go and do that and
frankly what's interesting about that
 
frankly what's interesting about that
story is that two of the three
 
story is that two of the three
Executives stayed and did stay you know
 
Executives stayed and did stay you know
which never got reported but when it did
 
which never got reported but when it did
eventually leak out and all of the other
 
eventually leak out and all of the other
sort of one-sided leaks that were
 
sort of one-sided leaks that were
happening at the time it was horrible I
 
happening at the time it was horrible I
mean it was just just as I had predicted
 
mean it was just just as I had predicted
of like if this gets out you know the
 
of like if this gets out you know the
story was you take away equity from
 
story was you take away equity from
employees and it haunted me by the way
 
employees and it haunted me by the way
for at multiple companies forever has it
 
for at multiple companies forever has it
has followed me wherever I have gone um
 
has followed me wherever I have gone um
and um you know but I I think if there
 
and um you know but I I think if there
are sort of if you are morally
 
are sort of if you are morally
challenged if you are super ethically
 
challenged if you are super ethically
challenged if there is something you've
 
challenged if there is something you've
got to walk away and I yeah I have been
 
got to walk away and I yeah I have been
an an experience where I you know was
 
an an experience where I you know was
somewhere that you would not be able to
 
somewhere that you would not be able to
find it but uh
 
find it but uh
and there were some things they wanted
 
and there were some things they wanted
me to do and I think it's because I had
 
me to do and I think it's because I had
just left a you know something like a
 
just left a you know something like a
Zinga which was very aggressive and
 
Zinga which was very aggressive and
high-profile and all those kinds of
 
high-profile and all those kinds of
things and I was just like I'm not I
 
things and I was just like I'm not I
don't that's not who I am I won't do
 
don't that's not who I am I won't do
that and my advice to a lot of I don't
 
that and my advice to a lot of I don't
think this is just for the HR space I
 
think this is just for the HR space I
think this is leadership in general but
 
think this is leadership in general but
it's like do not put yourself in a
 
it's like do not put yourself in a
situation where you are you have to stay
 
situation where you are you have to stay
somewhere for the money when I was at
 
somewhere for the money when I was at
Zinga I lived in a two-bedroom condo
 
Zinga I lived in a two-bedroom condo
with my husband my my son and my
 
with my husband my my son and my
sister um and I drove a Prius that was
 
sister um and I drove a Prius that was
like 10 years old and I you know and I
 
like 10 years old and I you know and I
have forever lived a lifestyle that
 
have forever lived a lifestyle that
would allow me to walk away and I think
 
would allow me to walk away and I think
that that is the best advice I can give
 
that that is the best advice I can give
to somebody is that don't ever be in a
 
to somebody is that don't ever be in a
situation where you you know are going
 
situation where you you know are going
to compromise who you are because you
 
to compromise who you are because you
need to for the money or the title or or
 
need to for the money or the title or or
something like that coling that story is
 
something like that coling that story is
incredible around taking unvested Equity
 
incredible around taking unvested Equity
away I've actually been in a similar
 
away I've actually been in a similar
situation and I've heard heard the sound
 
situation and I've heard heard the sound
bite multiple times and it especially
 
bite multiple times and it especially
comes up when layering is
 
comes up when layering is
discussed and I'm curious reflecting
 
discussed and I'm curious reflecting
back on the story you just
 
back on the story you just
told obviously the media picked up on a
 
told obviously the media picked up on a
narrative and I'm sure that was very
 
narrative and I'm sure that was very
hard from a recruiting brand standpoint
 
hard from a recruiting brand standpoint
but was it the right decision I think we
 
but was it the right decision I think we
should have just fired those people that
 
should have just fired those people that
was the right that would have been the
 
was the right that would have been the
right decision I mean honestly they
 
right decision I mean honestly they
ended up not being the superstars anyway
 
ended up not being the superstars anyway
so you know like wh and I have been
 
so you know like wh and I have been
asked by the way multiple times over the
 
asked by the way multiple times over the
years since by CEOs and other people
 
years since by CEOs and other people
like hey I know you like you know the
 
like hey I know you like you know the
people who thought of it positively or
 
people who thought of it positively or
and so or or wanted to do it themselves
 
and so or or wanted to do it themselves
would come back and ask me like how did
 
would come back and ask me like how did
you and I will often say you should fire
 
you and I will often say you should fire
that person like I think that that is
 
that person like I think that that is
for everybody involved probably the best
 
for everybody involved probably the best
would have been the better decision and
 
would have been the better decision and
maybe if the employee had come to to me
 
maybe if the employee had come to to me
and said like I can't do this job
 
and said like I can't do this job
anymore which actually in one of those
 
anymore which actually in one of those
cases I I think he was sort of on the
 
cases I I think he was sort of on the
bubble too of like this is too much for
 
bubble too of like this is too much for
me um maybe you would get to a place
 
me um maybe you would get to a place
that similar to I think other situations
 
that similar to I think other situations
where we have had maybe less
 
where we have had maybe less
high-profile employees and they end up
 
high-profile employees and they end up
in some sort of uh you know life
 
in some sort of uh you know life
situation that you need to like pause
 
situation that you need to like pause
vesting or rethink about some things I
 
vesting or rethink about some things I
think there's some either but no my end
 
think there's some either but no my end
of the day my answer would have been we
 
of the day my answer would have been we
should have fired them and moved on um
 
should have fired them and moved on um
and then you would have gotten that
 
and then you would have gotten that

H uh so much anything you'd offer just
at the top of your head just around dos
 
at the top of your head just around dos
and don'ts are some of the most potent
 
and don'ts are some of the most potent
moments in m&amp;a process that are super
 
moments in m&amp;a process that are super
important uh first of all I would say
 
important uh first of all I would say
it's better to be the acquiree than the
 
it's better to be the acquiree than the
acquired but we'll we'll start with that
 
acquired but we'll we'll start with that
maybe maybe not maybe it probably
 
maybe maybe not maybe it probably
depends on the situation but uh I way
 
depends on the situation but uh I way
way preferred being the person taking
 
way preferred being the person taking
the company versus uh yes so I I've been
 
the company versus uh yes so I I've been
on the both sides but on the having been
 
on the both sides but on the having been
acquired side uh I've been through it
 
acquired side uh I've been through it
twice um I I joined climate Corp right
 
twice um I I joined climate Corp right
when that acquisition was was happening
 
when that acquisition was was happening
so that was I was I wasn't in the
 
so that was I was I wasn't in the
diligence or anything I sort of I knew
 
diligence or anything I sort of I knew
it was happening although we were uh and
 
it was happening although we were uh and
climate Corps being acquired by
 
climate Corps being acquired by
Monsanto um and so I was joining a
 
Monsanto um and so I was joining a
company being acquired by um this huge
 
company being acquired by um this huge
name which by the way I have this whole
 
name which by the way I have this whole
history I always joke about I needed to
 
history I always joke about I needed to

end up in VC land because I had worked
at all the other evil Empires along the
 
at all the other evil Empires along the

um I really need a bank uh but pretty
 
um I really need a bank uh but pretty
much I had really sort of what are you
 
much I had really sort of what are you
GNA do next I know I don't even know
 
GNA do next I know I don't even know
where politics I don't know no I'm not
 
where politics I don't know no I'm not
doing that but that's probably the last
 
doing that but that's probably the last
one I would love to see that know will
 
one I would love to see that know will
not happen what you always have to
 
not happen what you always have to
remember on either side is that when
 
remember on either side is that when
when you are being acquired those people
 
when you are being acquired those people
did not sign up to work at that company
 
did not sign up to work at that company
they signed up to work for you know the
 
they signed up to work for you know the
original company and I think that
 
original company and I think that
there's a lot of ego that gets involved
 
there's a lot of ego that gets involved
with aren't why are people not excited
 
with aren't why are people not excited
to be at this company like we're so
 
to be at this company like we're so
great we're so amazing we're this big
 
great we're so amazing we're this big
huge brand like you should love us why
 
huge brand like you should love us why
don't you love us we want to just love
 
don't you love us we want to just love
you and like you and you're just like
 
you and like you and you're just like
but that's not what somebody it's not
 
but that's not what somebody it's not
you it's me right it really like that's
 
you it's me right it really like that's
not what someone signed up for so I
 
not what someone signed up for so I
think you know you always have to keep
 
think you know you always have to keep
that frame of reference in mind the
 
that frame of reference in mind the
Credit Karma one was unique in a lot of
 
Credit Karma one was unique in a lot of
ways we both climate and monsano and
 
ways we both climate and monsano and
cred Cara into it in my experience were
 
cred Cara into it in my experience were
set up to be independent company so um
 
set up to be independent company so um
sort of you know they used the LinkedIn
 
sort of you know they used the LinkedIn
Microsoft model which I think did a
 
Microsoft model which I think did a
really nice job and still you know does
 
really nice job and still you know does
a pretty good job of really allowing
 
a pretty good job of really allowing
them to retain a lot of their uniqueness
 
them to retain a lot of their uniqueness
it's very hard for companies to live
 
it's very hard for companies to live
that uh they acquire I mean it's just
 
that uh they acquire I mean it's just
too hard
 
too hard
to like we but your ours and we want you
 
to like we but your ours and we want you
to be ours and so you know one of the
 
to be ours and so you know one of the
lessons I had learned from having gone
 
lessons I had learned from having gone
through it twice was to write everything
 
through it twice was to write everything
down in the process and really get
 
down in the process and really get
nitty-gritty around what does
 
nitty-gritty around what does
independence mean who is controlling all
 
independence mean who is controlling all
of these different
 
of these different
levers um what are the stages that we're
 
levers um what are the stages that we're
going to revisit what are the
 
going to revisit what are the
qualifications that we're going to do to
 
qualifications that we're going to do to
revisit and that was super helpful you
 
revisit and that was super helpful you
know it was essentially our constitution
 
know it was essentially our constitution
of how we were going to operate with one
 
of how we were going to operate with one
another and then you had something that
 
another and then you had something that
you could point back to a lot of times
 
you could point back to a lot of times
to say like hey we agreed to this um and
 
to say like hey we agreed to this um and
I also think the other lesson I really
 
I also think the other lesson I really
tried to employ in the process was
 
tried to employ in the process was
trying to understand from the other
 
trying to understand from the other
Sid's perspective why they were doing
 
Sid's perspective why they were doing
this deal what was important to them and
 
this deal what was important to them and
approach any discussions from how you
 
approach any discussions from how you
can get to a win-win on both sides so
 
can get to a win-win on both sides so
for example with the credit karma into
 
for example with the credit karma into
it deal I you know was fortunate enough
 
it deal I you know was fortunate enough
that my boss from Microsoft 20s
 
that my boss from Microsoft 20s
something years ago runs all of Total
 
something years ago runs all of Total
Rewards now and all of the you know sort
 
Rewards now and all of the you know sort
of nitty-gritty around equity and pay
 
of nitty-gritty around equity and pay
and benefits and separate 401K plans and
 
and benefits and separate 401K plans and
all those kinds of stuff like that's in
 
all those kinds of stuff like that's in
her world at Microsoft and so you know I
 
her world at Microsoft and so you know I
spent a lot of time on the phone with
 
spent a lot of time on the phone with
her and she was great to put her m&amp;a
 
her and she was great to put her m&amp;a
people in touch with me so I could try
 
people in touch with me so I could try
and understand like what the concerns
 
and understand like what the concerns
would be from the in it side um and then
 
would be from the in it side um and then
when I would go into those conversations
 
when I would go into those conversations
you know I could have a better frame of
 
you know I could have a better frame of
reference of what outcome are we trying
 
reference of what outcome are we trying
to get to and how can I appreciate both
 
to get to and how can I appreciate both
sides and then the biggest thing is it's
 
sides and then the biggest thing is it's
so much about communication like
 
so much about communication like
communication communication
 
communication communication
communication um and again going back to
 
communication um and again going back to
what we were talking about at the
 
what we were talking about at the
beginning of when you are in one of
 
beginning of when you are in one of
these you know leadership
 
these you know leadership
roles you got to sign on you know
 
roles you got to sign on you know
and I may not have been yippy skippy

around even though deep down that wasn't
 
around even though deep down that wasn't
the path that I I mean I there was no
 
the path that I I mean I there was no

opportunity I I really wanted us to go
 
opportunity I I really wanted us to go
