# The H-1B Shakeup: Immigration Program Redesign and Alternative Pathways

## Transcript

What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Kelly,
it's good to see you. What a week, huh?
&gt;&gt; Oh my god, what a what a week, Nolan.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we made it. So, we're going to
cover two topics today. One is the H1B
madness from this past weekend. The
other is going to be a recap of a panel
that Kelly and I did with dear friend of
the show, Colleen McCreary, at the
Confluent People team offsite.
So, Kelly, let's start with this H1B
madness just to catch everybody up in
case you've been living under a rock in
Hawaii without service or just
completely unaware of your surroundings.
Last week,
&gt;&gt; people by the way, that sounds I mean,
terrific. That is exactly 0% of our
audience. Um, so last weekend, obviously
the Trump administration on Friday
evening, which I'm a little worried
what's going to happen, dropped a new
executive order on H-1Bs, essentially
saying that they're going to cost
$100,000 per year that then changed to
like, oh, it's only for new ones, and
maybe it's a one-time thing. There's
still a ton of uncertainty here. And so,
you know, my text chains blew up. We did
an emergency episode on Monday with
Nicole from Manifest Law. If you haven't
listened to that, you definitely should
if you have any sort of immigration
program at your company. But Kelly, like
what are you hearing on the streets?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just talked to one of my good
friends. I told you a couple hours ago,
and if she listens to this, which she
will, she knows who she is, but she's on
the East Coast, you know, and got this
note on the East Coast. It was like
Friday, right? It was late day, almost
evening. Do you know what I mean? It
wasn't like
&gt;&gt; it was night. It was it was night. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It wasn't like a Tuesday at, you know, 8
 
she happens to work in a company where
they heavily heavily use these these
visas and hire a lot of this great
talent and
it literally like created so much
anxiety and all this stuff for the
weekend. So, there's just that part of
it that I think we should call out is
the what of this is enough, but how this
hit and the franticness it caused. I
mean, right, we saw on the news planes
just tarmaced for 5 hours like it's just
not
&gt;&gt; like there's a what and there's a how.
We know this in tech. Like, your
performance is based on the what and the
how. Like, independent of the what, this
how is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awful. And
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; Someone should be fired over that. I
don't care if you agree or you disagree
with whatever this is or turns into be
or doesn't.
That's just terrible.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the roll out was uh it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up. Like it wasn't cool, you know, to
like make everybody scramble. We had
multiple friends who were literally
trying to track down hundreds of
employees to figure out where in the
world they were and if they were outside
of the country to try and get them back
before Sunday at midnight, aka Saturday
night, right? And this is on Friday that
they're trying to do this. You know, a
lot of that stuff came to pass as like
not a concern, but it didn't matter in
the moment, right? Like you still had to
do it and you had to
&gt;&gt; part is it was like, "Oh, just kidding.
You're fine if xyz." So, I just, you
know, like be a good person. Someone
think through this stuff. That's what
we're trained to do in our jobs, right?
You kind of walk through the process and
you think through all the angles and
it's just the 101 of a comm's plan.
That's
&gt;&gt; that sucks.
&gt;&gt; For me, it's for me it's kind of like
the microcosm of the chief people
officer role. like, you know, you sit
down on Friday night, you're at dinner
with your wife, you just like got the
the wine poured and you're about to just
take a deep breath for the first time in
six days and then all of a sudden your
phone starts blowing up. And sadly, like
that is a big part of the role. And to
your point, like these are all
self-inflicted wounds. Like it didn't
have to be this way, but it is this way.
And so now we're here. And so I want to
transition the conversation to you know
what are you hearing about people in
their immigration plans and what are
companies doing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have kind of two I guess ads to
this and the first one's probably not as
as interesting is a a lot of folks are
are pausing and you know we're we're one
of them and it's not pausing because we
don't want to do this. Do you know what
I mean? the $100,000. I think that that
tech companies will spend this for the
right talent. Albeit it might be a
little bit more selective and it might
force you know organizations to have
their stuff together so to speak on what
talent they need and if this is going to
be an investment. So it might put more
more teeth in that whereas before it was
a little like yeah go open it up get the
visa. So, I think that will shift, but a
lot of folks because of what we just
experienced over the weekend and the
continued ambiguity and the potential
for whip sign and pulling the rug out
and unknown, everyone's just kind of
like, I don't trust this. I'm going to
stop and pause until there's a little
bit more concrete information, which I
think is a valid thing to do. That was
actually my recommendation to friends
over the weekend who are at large tech
companies that have H-1Bs or many H-1Bs
on staff is I would be looking through
my recruiting pipeline right now,
understanding if people are required or
sorry have the work authorization for
the United States and then essentially
just like at least understanding that
group and saying if none of this is
timesensitive or like must be hired
yesterday, we should put a pause on it
because everything is uncertain and like
in moments of uncertainty, my goal is
always not to make the problem worse.
And I think you can make the problem
worse by just kind of like pushing on as
is and you know, crossing your fingers
and hoping like this doesn't become a
problem for us. So that feels like
actually like a prudent path forward.
The other thing I'm hearing is, and we
talked, I talked to Nicole about this on
Monday,
these alternative paths. And I think for
a long time, you know, immigration is
one of those things that you don't get
points for as a cheap. It's like make
sure it works, right? Make sure we're
able to hire people, make sure that
these people like are happy with the
process, and then just like never think
about it again.
Now, I think like we have to reopen this
book and we got to dust it off and
figure out like, well, let's think about
this from first principles. What are
other potential paths here? And again,
just referring back to the episode
Nicole and I did on Monday. She laid out
some really interesting options that I
think a lot of friends are starting to
like seriously look at.
Yeah, I personally know, you know,
multiple companies where if the prudent
path is to kind of pause and I agree
with that. We all know companies who are
like, "Fuck that. We're not waiting.
We're not going to play defense. We're
going to keep figuring out, right,
creative ways. That's the founder
mindset, you know, and I know companies
that are like, it might take 12, this is
one example, it might take 12 months and
cost some money and time, but get the
ball rolling on an entity in this
country.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; And make that decision. And usually, you
know, these companies were flirting with
that geo footprint anyway. So, it's not
like a out ofthe- blue random decision,
although it could be. If nothing else,
to have the option and use it as an
insurance policy, so to speak, to not be
stuck another year from now if this
stuff continues or gets worse or
continues to be, you know, that they
just want to continue to play offense
and have options and it's a backs stop
move and they're like, it's going to
cost 100k to get talented anyway. I'm
going to spend an opening this entity
and hopefully being able to play more
offense a year from now if things are
the same or maybe even more stringent.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 100%. I mean, yeah, it's uncertain
and I will say I do think we have some
hints, right? And in the proclamation,
it was super clear that the current
administration wants to continue to hire
or continue to attract top talent. I
just think the path of the H1B given how
much consternation there was about this,
especially the term Gary Tan uses is
body shops. So these like large
consulting firms that are just like
trying to get as many of these people as
possible and then they contract them out
to American tech companies. I think
that's the problem they're trying to
solve. Is this the best way to solve the
problem? I'm not sure. like this is a
very complicated matter,
&gt;&gt; but I do think the administration has
hinted like they still want the best
talent in the United States.
&gt;&gt; And so if it was me and I was a chief
people officer today and I was looking
at my immigration program, I think your
path is an interesting one which is like
looking at some of these these other
countries and establishing entities
there. I think another interesting path
is like what are these alternatives that
Nicole talked about on Monday and do
they make sense for our employee
population and what is specifically the
probability that we can actually use
this as a vehicle to get these people
that we want to hire.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. The last thing I guess I'm curious
your take cuz we we love to talk about
our little bubble here and tapped a
couple friends in different states. are
like what whatever like you guys are
it's just impacting you and tech and
California like are you hearing that am
I on Pluto again it's one two data
points which may be ridiculous but
&gt;&gt; yeah I mean you know so I grew up in
Gilbert Arizona and
&gt;&gt; Gilbert
&gt;&gt; yeah and by the Gilbert now is like a
fully built out place when I was there
it was like farm towns and so does the
known where it were is that on the map.
Let's see.
&gt;&gt; Gilbert. Gilbert is about 15 minutes
southeast of Scottsdale. It's like 20
minutes to Sky Harbor Airport. So, it
actually is like super central in the
zone. But anyways, I mentioned it to say
that my friend group there does not work
in tech. And you know, when they see
this stuff for them, they're just like
good, like good. We should not like we
should be really thoughtful about
attracting the best talent to our
country. And if there's these like weird
back doors that people are exploiting,
we should shut them. And so there's that
piece. The other piece though in our
bubble is I think there's been a really
big narrative around this kneecapping
the startup industry.
And you know, Gary Tan came out and said
that that exact phrase over the weekend
on X and on LinkedIn.
And look, I mean, I guess like I'm still
get gathering information. My experience
has been for a brand new startup, so
many things have to go right that like
putting somebody through the H-1B
lottery feels like another miracle in a
series of miracles you already need. So
why would you do that? You would avoid
that path and constrain it to, you know,
to Americanbased hiring or to visas that
are like much more clear that you're
going to be able to work with these
people long term. But that said, it does
appear that like H-1B transfers are
happening into startups. And so I I
think it's it remains to be seen how
much of an impact this will have on the
startup industry. My gut tells me it's
not going to be that big of a deal
because there's going to be a different
path, but certainly it's it's
disruptive.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it.
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
which uh let's just put it out there.
That sounds pretty boring if you think
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
prevention training, not very exciting,
right? We are very lucky in that we are
in the HR tech space. That's required,
right? Harassment prevention training is
not really optional. You need it. The
question is, who are you going to use
for it?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You're doing this training
whether you want to or not. But here's
what she told us about the impact.
&gt;&gt; The amount of impact that I've been able
to have from the HR perspective has been
just huge. It's phenomenal. We're doing
all these amazing things that quite
frankly too many companies don't do
because they don't understand the power
of their HR team.
&gt;&gt; Instead of boring check the box training
that everyone hates, Athena delivers
content that's modern and impactful.
We're talking 200 plus courses in 100
plus languages with a 93% learner
positivity rating to back it up. They
take on all the tough topics, harassment
prevention, workplace violence
prevention, code of conduct, and make
them actually engaging. And for HR, it's
effortless. Training runs on autopilot
with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
Done right? Like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

Yeah. No, I I I'm glad you shared that
story. Again, independent of what you
agree with or don't or your position,
it's just really good to know what you
know, all the angles, the reactions.
It's important.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Especially outside of tech. So,
&gt;&gt; more to come on this topic. We are going
to be we're going to stay close on this
one and keep people posted with what
we're hearing and also obviously
anything that comes out that will
actually like make real policy change
that we can then operate on. Second
topic I want to talk about is two weeks
ago, Kelly, you and I flew to Vegas to
go hang out with Colleen at the
Confluent People Team Offsite. What was
your takeaway from that event? What' you
think?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was it was great. So, Colleen,
you know, our our our uh friend friendly
bestie on here u runs I didn't know this
Confluent, which is a you know, pretty
it's not a new company, right? How long
has it been around
&gt;&gt; publicly traded tech company?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And her HR team is 150 people
strong. And the first thing I'll say is
good for her is is you I I think we're
on the verge of seeing this trend of
really good people leaders taking on
more Nolan. So, not only is she the
people leader, but recently she was
given like all of bisops and it and
she's got this huge remmit and
I love that because the mindset she's
always had is building a business. It
wasn't HR and you know I talked to
someone else about my new gig at Supio
and it's like it's not really HR. It's
like how do we build this freaking
thing? It doesn't matter if it's HR or
business or this or that or revop. So, I
love the mindset she brought to that end
of the offsite. Um, it was great. We
kind of did um what we do on here with
the group um on stage. We bantered, we
disagreed, we kicked stuff around, you
know, we poked fun at each other. And I
thought it was really good. I was
surprised the group seemed a little bit
more um wideeyed than I'm used to. And I
don't know if that's like the company or
the industry or it's public. It's
bigger. Nolan, I felt like things we
were saying were a little bit edgier
than I guess I'm used to having chats
around here. And that's not bad or good.
I just it because it was really helpful
and there was ton of engagement, ton of
questions, but yeah, it was definitely
spicy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was. So, you know, typically
when you get me, you and Colleen
together, you're going to get a lot of
contrarian takes and then you're going
to get like disagreement. And I think
like the biggest takeaway for me was
like one conversation was really fun and
I think it stretched like the thinking
of all of us, right? The group and the
three of us
&gt;&gt; which is like the whole reason you and I
do this podcast every week is like it's
good to hear differing perspectives.
thing too is it turns out like people
listen to the show I guess and like we
had like listeners get up and say like
Nolan I know you hate employee
engagement surveys like why do you hate
them so much like what is your deal with
these things and we had I think we had
actually like a great discussion on that
we talked a lot about AI and the use
cases specifically that I'm seeing and
then Colleen asked me a question that no
one's really asked me directly and she
asked this question to both of us and
she asked asked, "What's your most
contrarian HR belief?"
&gt;&gt; Well, remind me what your answer was,
Kelly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, yes. Yeah. She asked, you
know, what what have you kind of been
shunned for, whether it's, you know,
outside your company or inside your
company for
&gt;&gt; your philosophies, right, or things that
you've said or done. And I was like, I
remember in 2016 I was working at Hired.
Remember the recruiting platform Hired?
And we were big proponents of pay equity
and pay transparency, right? Because we
were helping folks get great great
offers and we were a marketplace for
hiring companies and candidates. And
that being said, so we were very
prominent in the industry and in the
area on wage gap and wage transparency
and equity. And I remember saying, "I
don't believe that everyone should make
the same." And in some cases, a man
maybe should make more than a woman in
the same job or vice versa, or maybe
this male should make more than this
male, or this woman should make more
than this one. It's more complicated
than that. And I I I got a lot of flack
for that because it was heavy DEI era,
which I still agree with everyone. It's
just I got a lot of flack for because
what people heard was you support women
making less than men. Right. That that
was the takeaway which wasn't what I
said, but that was a whole thing and I
stuck to it and I still do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a it's such a nuanced topic
and and I do think people who have
actually been in the calibration
sessions and then have taken the
calibration into performance like
locking in performance and then looking
at comp, you know, variance. What I
always say is like if it ends up on the
front page of the New York Times, can we
explain why?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. For sure. What was your
answer?
&gt;&gt; My Okay, so my answer, yeah, I was when
she hit me with this on this the stage,
I was like, man, I have a lot of these.
Um, but like if I was to put it under
one umbrella, it would be do not bring
your personal beliefs into the
organization and expect the organization
to operationalize them.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. MetaView is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
MetaView's suite of AI agents works for
you at every stage of the hiring
process. Their platform powers instant
job postc creation, AI powered candidate
Q&amp;A, insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metivview changes
all of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metivview covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than three minutes
to set up. Join talent leaders at more
than 3,000 elite companies like Brex,
Deal, 11 Labs, and Kora and check out
MeteView. Just head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts or get started for free. You'll
be uprun an AI enabled in minutes.
&gt;&gt; And so specifically what I'm getting at
there is, you know, I've done this. I
made this mistake of coming into an
organization being like this these are
the things I believe and that matter to
me and I want to operationalize them and
have them be part of the company's
ethos. And it turns out companies
specifically with founder companies but
even just like companies with the hired
CEO
like it's not our choice
like it's the HR leader is supposed to
take what the leadership team wants and
to operationalize that not to bring
their thing in and say we should be
doing this because I believe this is
right and I'm looking out for our people
and so um yeah how do you think that
landed?
 
Look, I like I said, I kind of got wide
eyes with mine and I think you kind of
got some wide eyes with yours. And
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; I guess what I loved about all of it
though, and Colleen had some hot takes
too when I saw them kind of like um
&gt;&gt; Yeah. is shocking the system by by
speaking openly and showing that there
are different very poignant viewpoints
and you're going to run into that your
whole career was kind of like how it
encapsulate the whole thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. For me it was like another
reminder of how important it is to have
conversations
with people who have these differing
viewpoints.
And you know, I walked away from the
event like feeling like my mind had
expanded on topics that I like I'd been
thinking about for a little while and
then like coming in a little bit more
refined after the fact and you know you
and I talked to a bunch of people after
which was a blast cuz then they could
come and like be like like dude what's
wrong with you?
&gt;&gt; Um
&gt;&gt; but it it wasn't like that. It was more
of just like huh elaborate more on this
thing. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you know, it it reminded me about
like the people who I love to hang with
the most are those that are like
generally curious
&gt;&gt; and they're open to changing their mind.
And so, you know, what you describe as
wideeyed, I would describe as people
thinking about something from a
different angle that they hadn't maybe
considered and then they were like
pondering that thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that's fun. I think that was
definitely delivered and frankly it's
really important like there was a time
in my career even in the last 10 years
where I wasn't doing that as much as I
should because you can kind of get into
your thing and your you know what I mean
and this this podcast and frankly
hanging out with you because we disagree
in a lot of stuff um
&gt;&gt; and just not taking stuff personally and
being like yeah this is awkward but I
think you're ridiculous and you're great
and well why like right even though you
disagree and not getting angry why like
tell me, let me unpack that in your
mind. Um
was a big one. And I think the other
thing I'll say, and I've told you this
many times, I just had a one of my um
heads of people coaching clients uh 45
minutes ago and hit it again. You never
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know what is going to come like,
right? You don't really know the the
wonderful ripple effects and the
different doors and experiences that are
going to come with things that you just
say yes to. and you don't know what's
going to happen. Do you know what I
mean? Like this podcast, I thought we'd
get kicked out in 6 months. I'm like,
great, I'll learn what
&gt;&gt; I'll learn what media production is.
Whatever. And here we are. And you and
Colleen are really close now. You were
kind of friendnemies before. We're
really close.
&gt;&gt; No, we were straight. We were straight
enemies before like you introduced us.
That's like we which we told that story,
too.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Colleen and I are now
like friends. We were not We were close,
but we weren't like friends. Um, and
look at that, right? We we did this
thing and you know, I I come from a like
a working class. We we didn't grow up
with a ton ton of money and it's like,
"Hey, come to Vegas for 24 hours. Like
all expenses paid, talk with the team
and hang out and that stuff like matters
to me at least." So, I guess I just keep
honing on this topic in in careers that
it is about people and it's about being
altruistic and doing things.
maybe you don't get anything from it
right away. You get like look what's
happened. So, I just want to hit that
home. It's a little cheesy, but um it
was really cool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was awesome. And it's like it's
it's another reminder of like what I
love most about the show and you know
our relationship and our relationship
with Colleen is that we don't agree on
everything and not even close to
everything, right? But like we can still
be friends. we can understand the other
po person's perspective and we can still
love each other and I think that that is
like a hopefully like the thing people
get out of this is like different
perspectives and different uh angles to
solve problems and think about problems
but that's my favorite part about doing
this with you Kelly are we on like year
three now is that like where we are in
this thing like
&gt;&gt; dog ears I don't know but we've gotten a
lot of great feedback that people people
like this because it does have meat and
it has meaningful stuff But it's also
enjoyable and it's kind of light and we
joke. People are like, "Ugh, I listen to
you on my commute cuz it's like you're
going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work. You don't want to
like listen to more, you know, work
stuff." And so it's light that way. So
I'm going to end on a I'm going to end
on a light note. You're going to love
this.
&gt;&gt; Please.
&gt;&gt; Speaking of poking at each other. So I
want the I want the audience's feedback
on this. Text me or text no one or

ballroom waiting for Colleen and I are
waiting for Nolan to come in and he
comes in and I just want you to picture
I want you to you know where I'm going.
I know exactly.
&gt;&gt; For those of you who have met Nolan,
he's like what, 63?
&gt;&gt; 6'4.
&gt;&gt; 6'4. Very tall, very slender. Um I think
I called you the stork once of a person.
Great great looking human. Love it. Has
a full like button-down shirt on, tucked
in perfectly with a a shiny brown belt.
Pants are high-waisted. looks like slim
jeans that have no wrinkles in it. The
best part are these like Italian like
moccasin loafer like brown leather
shoes, right? Slipped on, no socks, just
looks like, you know what I mean? Like
um I don't even know. But I was like,
"Look at this. Look." And I'm sitting
there in my hoodie and you know the same
Adidas shoes and I'm like, "Look, look
at this dress for success." And Nolan
goes, "You know what? Silicon Valley is
cleaning up. People are dressing up
more. And I was like, "No, they're not.
I want opinions. I want opinions on
this."
&gt;&gt; I also said I also said, "My mother
taught me to never be underdressed."
And so, by the way, she's like number
one listener of the show. Love you,
Mommy. So, with that, always great
hanging with you guys and we'll see you
next week.
