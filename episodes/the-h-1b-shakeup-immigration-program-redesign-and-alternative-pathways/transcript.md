&gt;&gt; like there's a what and there's a how.
 
&gt;&gt; like there's a what and there's a how.
We know this in tech. Like, your
 
We know this in tech. Like, your
performance is based on the what and the
 
performance is based on the what and the
how. Like, independent of the what, this
 
how. Like, independent of the what, this
how is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awful. And
 
how is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awful. And
&gt;&gt; I agree.
 
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; Someone should be fired over that. I
 
&gt;&gt; Someone should be fired over that. I
don't care if you agree or you disagree
 
don't care if you agree or you disagree
with whatever this is or turns into be
 
with whatever this is or turns into be

That's just terrible.
 
That's just terrible.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the roll out was uh it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the roll out was uh it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up. Like it wasn't cool, you know, to
 
up. Like it wasn't cool, you know, to
like make everybody scramble. We had
 
like make everybody scramble. We had
multiple friends who were literally
 
multiple friends who were literally
trying to track down hundreds of
 
trying to track down hundreds of
employees to figure out where in the
 
employees to figure out where in the
world they were and if they were outside
 
world they were and if they were outside
of the country to try and get them back
 
of the country to try and get them back
before Sunday at midnight, aka Saturday
 
before Sunday at midnight, aka Saturday
night, right? And this is on Friday that
 
night, right? And this is on Friday that
they're trying to do this. You know, a
 
they're trying to do this. You know, a
lot of that stuff came to pass as like
 
lot of that stuff came to pass as like
not a concern, but it didn't matter in
 
not a concern, but it didn't matter in
the moment, right? Like you still had to
 
the moment, right? Like you still had to
do it and you had to
 
do it and you had to
&gt;&gt; part is it was like, "Oh, just kidding.
 
&gt;&gt; part is it was like, "Oh, just kidding.
You're fine if xyz." So, I just, you
 
You're fine if xyz." So, I just, you
know, like be a good person. Someone
 
know, like be a good person. Someone
think through this stuff. That's what
 
think through this stuff. That's what
we're trained to do in our jobs, right?
 
we're trained to do in our jobs, right?
You kind of walk through the process and
 
You kind of walk through the process and
you think through all the angles and
 
you think through all the angles and
it's just the 101 of a comm's plan.
 
it's just the 101 of a comm's plan.
That's
 
That's
&gt;&gt; that sucks.
 
&gt;&gt; that sucks.
&gt;&gt; For me, it's for me it's kind of like
 
&gt;&gt; For me, it's for me it's kind of like
the microcosm of the chief people
 
the microcosm of the chief people
officer role. like, you know, you sit
 
officer role. like, you know, you sit
down on Friday night, you're at dinner
 
down on Friday night, you're at dinner
with your wife, you just like got the
 
with your wife, you just like got the
the wine poured and you're about to just
 
the wine poured and you're about to just
take a deep breath for the first time in
 
take a deep breath for the first time in
six days and then all of a sudden your
 
six days and then all of a sudden your
phone starts blowing up. And sadly, like
 
phone starts blowing up. And sadly, like
that is a big part of the role. And to
 
that is a big part of the role. And to
your point, like these are all
 
your point, like these are all
self-inflicted wounds. Like it didn't
 
self-inflicted wounds. Like it didn't
have to be this way, but it is this way.
 
have to be this way, but it is this way.
And so now we're here. And so I want to
 
And so now we're here. And so I want to
transition the conversation to you know
 
transition the conversation to you know
what are you hearing about people in
 
what are you hearing about people in
their immigration plans and what are
 
their immigration plans and what are
companies doing?
 
companies doing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have kind of two I guess ads to
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have kind of two I guess ads to
this and the first one's probably not as
 
this and the first one's probably not as
as interesting is a a lot of folks are
 
as interesting is a a lot of folks are
are pausing and you know we're we're one
 
are pausing and you know we're we're one
of them and it's not pausing because we
 
of them and it's not pausing because we
don't want to do this. Do you know what
 
don't want to do this. Do you know what
I mean? the $100,000. I think that that
 
I mean? the $100,000. I think that that
tech companies will spend this for the
 
tech companies will spend this for the
right talent. Albeit it might be a
 
right talent. Albeit it might be a
little bit more selective and it might
 
little bit more selective and it might
force you know organizations to have
 
force you know organizations to have
their stuff together so to speak on what
 
their stuff together so to speak on what
talent they need and if this is going to
 
talent they need and if this is going to
be an investment. So it might put more
 
be an investment. So it might put more
more teeth in that whereas before it was
 
more teeth in that whereas before it was
a little like yeah go open it up get the
 
a little like yeah go open it up get the
visa. So, I think that will shift, but a
 
visa. So, I think that will shift, but a
lot of folks because of what we just
 
lot of folks because of what we just
experienced over the weekend and the
 
experienced over the weekend and the
continued ambiguity and the potential
 
continued ambiguity and the potential
for whip sign and pulling the rug out
 
for whip sign and pulling the rug out
and unknown, everyone's just kind of
 
and unknown, everyone's just kind of
like, I don't trust this. I'm going to
 
like, I don't trust this. I'm going to
stop and pause until there's a little
 
stop and pause until there's a little
bit more concrete information, which I
 
bit more concrete information, which I
think is a valid thing to do. That was
 
think is a valid thing to do. That was
actually my recommendation to friends
 
actually my recommendation to friends
over the weekend who are at large tech
 
over the weekend who are at large tech
companies that have H-1Bs or many H-1Bs
 
companies that have H-1Bs or many H-1Bs
on staff is I would be looking through
 
on staff is I would be looking through
my recruiting pipeline right now,
 
my recruiting pipeline right now,
understanding if people are required or
 
understanding if people are required or
sorry have the work authorization for
 
sorry have the work authorization for
the United States and then essentially
 
the United States and then essentially
just like at least understanding that
 
just like at least understanding that
group and saying if none of this is
 
group and saying if none of this is
timesensitive or like must be hired
 
timesensitive or like must be hired
yesterday, we should put a pause on it
 
yesterday, we should put a pause on it
because everything is uncertain and like
 
because everything is uncertain and like
in moments of uncertainty, my goal is
 
in moments of uncertainty, my goal is
always not to make the problem worse.
 
always not to make the problem worse.
And I think you can make the problem
 
And I think you can make the problem
worse by just kind of like pushing on as
 
worse by just kind of like pushing on as
is and you know, crossing your fingers
 
is and you know, crossing your fingers
and hoping like this doesn't become a
 
and hoping like this doesn't become a
problem for us. So that feels like
 
problem for us. So that feels like
actually like a prudent path forward.
 
actually like a prudent path forward.
The other thing I'm hearing is, and we
 
The other thing I'm hearing is, and we
talked, I talked to Nicole about this on
 
talked, I talked to Nicole about this on
Monday,
 
Monday,
these alternative paths. And I think for
 
these alternative paths. And I think for
a long time, you know, immigration is
 
a long time, you know, immigration is
one of those things that you don't get
 
one of those things that you don't get
points for as a cheap. It's like make
 
points for as a cheap. It's like make
sure it works, right? Make sure we're
 
sure it works, right? Make sure we're
able to hire people, make sure that
 
able to hire people, make sure that
these people like are happy with the
 
these people like are happy with the
process, and then just like never think
 
process, and then just like never think
about it again.
 
about it again.
Now, I think like we have to reopen this
 
Now, I think like we have to reopen this
book and we got to dust it off and
 
book and we got to dust it off and
figure out like, well, let's think about
 
figure out like, well, let's think about
this from first principles. What are
 
this from first principles. What are
other potential paths here? And again,
 
other potential paths here? And again,
just referring back to the episode
 
just referring back to the episode
Nicole and I did on Monday. She laid out
 
Nicole and I did on Monday. She laid out
some really interesting options that I
 
some really interesting options that I
think a lot of friends are starting to
 
think a lot of friends are starting to
like seriously look at.
 
like seriously look at.
Yeah, I personally know, you know,
 
Yeah, I personally know, you know,
multiple companies where if the prudent
 
multiple companies where if the prudent
path is to kind of pause and I agree
 
path is to kind of pause and I agree
with that. We all know companies who are
 
with that. We all know companies who are
like, "Fuck that. We're not waiting.
 
like, "Fuck that. We're not waiting.
We're not going to play defense. We're
 
We're not going to play defense. We're
going to keep figuring out, right,
 
going to keep figuring out, right,
creative ways. That's the founder
 
creative ways. That's the founder
mindset, you know, and I know companies
 
mindset, you know, and I know companies
that are like, it might take 12, this is
 
that are like, it might take 12, this is
one example, it might take 12 months and
 
one example, it might take 12 months and
cost some money and time, but get the
 
cost some money and time, but get the
ball rolling on an entity in this
 
ball rolling on an entity in this
country.
 
country.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
 
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; And make that decision. And usually, you
 
&gt;&gt; And make that decision. And usually, you
know, these companies were flirting with
 
know, these companies were flirting with
that geo footprint anyway. So, it's not
 
that geo footprint anyway. So, it's not
like a out ofthe- blue random decision,
 
like a out ofthe- blue random decision,
although it could be. If nothing else,
 
although it could be. If nothing else,
to have the option and use it as an
 
to have the option and use it as an
insurance policy, so to speak, to not be
 
insurance policy, so to speak, to not be
stuck another year from now if this
 
stuck another year from now if this
stuff continues or gets worse or
 
stuff continues or gets worse or
continues to be, you know, that they
 
continues to be, you know, that they
just want to continue to play offense
 
just want to continue to play offense
and have options and it's a backs stop
 
and have options and it's a backs stop
move and they're like, it's going to
 
move and they're like, it's going to
cost 100k to get talented anyway. I'm
 
cost 100k to get talented anyway. I'm
going to spend an opening this entity
 
going to spend an opening this entity
and hopefully being able to play more
 
and hopefully being able to play more
offense a year from now if things are
 
offense a year from now if things are
the same or maybe even more stringent.
 
the same or maybe even more stringent.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 100%. I mean, yeah, it's uncertain
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 100%. I mean, yeah, it's uncertain
and I will say I do think we have some
 
and I will say I do think we have some
hints, right? And in the proclamation,
 
hints, right? And in the proclamation,
it was super clear that the current
 
it was super clear that the current
administration wants to continue to hire
 
administration wants to continue to hire
or continue to attract top talent. I
 
or continue to attract top talent. I
just think the path of the H1B given how
 
just think the path of the H1B given how
much consternation there was about this,
 
much consternation there was about this,
especially the term Gary Tan uses is
 
especially the term Gary Tan uses is
body shops. So these like large
 
body shops. So these like large
consulting firms that are just like
 
consulting firms that are just like
trying to get as many of these people as
 
trying to get as many of these people as
possible and then they contract them out
 
possible and then they contract them out
to American tech companies. I think
 
to American tech companies. I think
that's the problem they're trying to
 
that's the problem they're trying to
solve. Is this the best way to solve the
 
solve. Is this the best way to solve the
problem? I'm not sure. like this is a
 
problem? I'm not sure. like this is a
very complicated matter,
 
very complicated matter,
&gt;&gt; but I do think the administration has
 
&gt;&gt; but I do think the administration has
hinted like they still want the best
 
hinted like they still want the best
talent in the United States.
 
talent in the United States.
&gt;&gt; And so if it was me and I was a chief
 
&gt;&gt; And so if it was me and I was a chief
people officer today and I was looking
 
people officer today and I was looking
at my immigration program, I think your
 
at my immigration program, I think your
path is an interesting one which is like
 
path is an interesting one which is like
looking at some of these these other
 
looking at some of these these other
countries and establishing entities
 
countries and establishing entities
there. I think another interesting path
 
there. I think another interesting path
is like what are these alternatives that
 
is like what are these alternatives that
Nicole talked about on Monday and do
 
Nicole talked about on Monday and do
they make sense for our employee
 
they make sense for our employee
population and what is specifically the
 
population and what is specifically the
probability that we can actually use
 
probability that we can actually use
this as a vehicle to get these people
 
this as a vehicle to get these people
that we want to hire.
 
that we want to hire.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. The last thing I guess I'm curious
 
&gt;&gt; Mhm. The last thing I guess I'm curious
your take cuz we we love to talk about
 
your take cuz we we love to talk about
our little bubble here and tapped a
 
our little bubble here and tapped a
couple friends in different states. are
 
couple friends in different states. are
like what whatever like you guys are
 
like what whatever like you guys are
it's just impacting you and tech and
 
it's just impacting you and tech and
California like are you hearing that am
 
California like are you hearing that am
I on Pluto again it's one two data
 
I on Pluto again it's one two data
points which may be ridiculous but
 
points which may be ridiculous but
&gt;&gt; yeah I mean you know so I grew up in
 
&gt;&gt; yeah I mean you know so I grew up in
Gilbert Arizona and
 
Gilbert Arizona and
&gt;&gt; Gilbert
 
&gt;&gt; Gilbert
&gt;&gt; yeah and by the Gilbert now is like a
 
&gt;&gt; yeah and by the Gilbert now is like a
fully built out place when I was there
 
fully built out place when I was there
it was like farm towns and so does the
 
it was like farm towns and so does the
known where it were is that on the map.
 
known where it were is that on the map.
Let's see.
 
Let's see.
&gt;&gt; Gilbert. Gilbert is about 15 minutes
 
&gt;&gt; Gilbert. Gilbert is about 15 minutes
southeast of Scottsdale. It's like 20
 
southeast of Scottsdale. It's like 20
minutes to Sky Harbor Airport. So, it
 
minutes to Sky Harbor Airport. So, it
actually is like super central in the
 
actually is like super central in the
zone. But anyways, I mentioned it to say
 
zone. But anyways, I mentioned it to say
that my friend group there does not work
 
that my friend group there does not work
in tech. And you know, when they see
 
in tech. And you know, when they see
this stuff for them, they're just like
 
this stuff for them, they're just like
good, like good. We should not like we
 
good, like good. We should not like we
should be really thoughtful about
 
should be really thoughtful about
attracting the best talent to our
 
attracting the best talent to our
country. And if there's these like weird
 
country. And if there's these like weird
back doors that people are exploiting,
 
back doors that people are exploiting,
we should shut them. And so there's that
 
we should shut them. And so there's that
piece. The other piece though in our
 
piece. The other piece though in our
bubble is I think there's been a really
 
bubble is I think there's been a really
big narrative around this kneecapping
 
big narrative around this kneecapping
the startup industry.
 
the startup industry.
And you know, Gary Tan came out and said
 
And you know, Gary Tan came out and said
that that exact phrase over the weekend
 
that that exact phrase over the weekend
on X and on LinkedIn.
 
on X and on LinkedIn.
And look, I mean, I guess like I'm still
 
And look, I mean, I guess like I'm still
get gathering information. My experience
 
get gathering information. My experience
has been for a brand new startup, so
 
has been for a brand new startup, so
many things have to go right that like
 
many things have to go right that like
putting somebody through the H-1B
 
putting somebody through the H-1B
lottery feels like another miracle in a
 
lottery feels like another miracle in a
series of miracles you already need. So
 
series of miracles you already need. So
why would you do that? You would avoid
 
why would you do that? You would avoid
that path and constrain it to, you know,
 
that path and constrain it to, you know,
to Americanbased hiring or to visas that
 
to Americanbased hiring or to visas that
are like much more clear that you're
 
are like much more clear that you're
going to be able to work with these
 
going to be able to work with these
people long term. But that said, it does
 
people long term. But that said, it does
appear that like H-1B transfers are
 
appear that like H-1B transfers are
happening into startups. And so I I
 
happening into startups. And so I I
think it's it remains to be seen how
 
think it's it remains to be seen how
much of an impact this will have on the
 
much of an impact this will have on the
startup industry. My gut tells me it's
 
startup industry. My gut tells me it's
not going to be that big of a deal
 
not going to be that big of a deal
because there's going to be a different
 
because there's going to be a different
path, but certainly it's it's
 
path, but certainly it's it's
disruptive.
 
disruptive.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
 
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
 
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
 
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
 
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
 
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
 
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
 
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
 
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
 
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
 
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
 
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
 
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it.
 
honest about it.
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
 
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
which uh let's just put it out there.
 
which uh let's just put it out there.
That sounds pretty boring if you think
 
That sounds pretty boring if you think
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
 
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
prevention training, not very exciting,
 
prevention training, not very exciting,
right? We are very lucky in that we are
 
right? We are very lucky in that we are
in the HR tech space. That's required,
 
in the HR tech space. That's required,
right? Harassment prevention training is
 
right? Harassment prevention training is
not really optional. You need it. The
 
not really optional. You need it. The
question is, who are you going to use
 
question is, who are you going to use
for it?
 
for it?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You're doing this training
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You're doing this training
