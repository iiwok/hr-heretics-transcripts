hey everyone welcome to another episode
of HR Heretics I'm here with my friend
Nolan uh we're excited to jump into a
topic that's actually pretty timely and
I thought would be kind of cool to cover
and kick around for a few minutes and
the topic Nolan is giving feedback to
close colleagues people that you really
respect like and care about and bringing
up some hard messages with them uh I
don't know about you but over my 25
years in doing this that's some of the
most anxious coaching that I've given
people is their anxiety around giving
feedback to people they like uh it's so
much easier for them to give feedback to
people that they might not respect right
they don't care Etc and so we had um a
conference last week responsive
conference that you and I uh spoke at
and I shared some feedback with Nolan
and I thought we could dissect it and
talk about just this phenomenon and why
it's so difficult and some tips around
how you can get better at it yeah let's
do it Kelly this is going to be like our
therapy session for everyone to listen
to I love it so no and I were having a
conversation with a friend after our
panel and I said hey hey dude do you
mind if I give you some feedback I'd
love your your thoughts on this or if
I'm if I'm on Pluto and my feedback to
Nolan was that sometimes times after I'm
done talking and yes I can be more of
verose than Nan we all know this uh he
sometimes will jump in and say what
Kelly meant was or what I think you're
saying and I took it a certain way and I
wasn't sure how he meant that but I said
hey what is that what is that like what
are you doing with that because
sometimes I take it as you're clarifying
or you're speaking for me and I was very
curious as to
what he was doing there and I brought it
up and I'll let you I'll let you kind of
cover that but the friend that we were
talking to she stopped and literally and
I appreciated this she pointed it out
she was observing she was observing and
she she was sitting in the middle of us
and she stopped us and I loved it and
she said it's really cool how you you
you both can do that um you know
sometimes that can be a high stakes
contentious defensive thing and it was
like a non event yeah well so yeah so
let let's let me let me get a little bit
more context so so Kelly Kelly it's
exactly what you did which is you go hey
um this has come up for me I just you
know can I give you some feedback and I
was like please and you know you stated
the feedback as you just did and then
what I did is I was like I was seeking
to understand and I was like oh that's
interesting when did I do it and so you
gave me a couple of specific examples
our friend who was on the panel with us
was like that did happen there and then
I was like oh yeah I and which jogged my
memory of spec specifically when I did
it and what I said was
um you're right what I'm trying to do is
to give the audience something like very
short and tangible that they can walk
away with because I actually think you
nailed the point I just want them to be
able to think about that point very
succinctly afterwards so then I was like
you know we we we um we traded a little
bit more on it and the the other thing
that you said which I thought was an
awesome tool I've never seen anyone do
this is you go it's like a two out of 10
for me
and that provided me additional context
to like the severity um which I loved as
like just a really small little tool
that you included and where we left it
there was hey let's cuz it's look we're
too close to the thing in this one we
need to go get outside feedback and get
people out like who listen to the Pod or
who were at the conference to get their
take on it to see how it was received
and so you know that's what we did I
actually talked to our producer um we
had a scheduled call it wasn't like I
called it right away but we actually did
have a scheduled call that night and and
I was like Hey like Kelly give me this
feedback she said it's two out of 10
like what's your take on it I'm
forgetting the term that she used but
she did mention like that is a specific
tactic uh that podcasters use to make
sure that the audience has a tangible
takeaway which is my intent but I you
know first of all like one thank you for
the feedback like I love feedback and I
know people say that and they kind of
sound like like full of when they
say that but like I earnestly do and
two for me it actually improved the
depth of our
relationship yeah and it it just makes
it more real like I I like when you tell
me things that are actually on your mind
even though they may be uncomfortable
for me like I just feel like I know
where we're at and it's more of an
authentic relationship yeah it was great
and I I really appreciated how
you inquired right your first reaction
wasn't a response it was another
question and multiple questions and that
opened me up too like oh he actually
wants to hear about this this isn't like
check got it thank you let's move on
that added more depth to the
conversation and then the relationship
and I just want to Accent this point
because you know we were having a good
time we were laughing and it would have
been so easy just to not bring it up
because like I said it wasn't that big
of a deal to me at least and it could
have been fine not to bring it up and
move on and live our life and probably
easier but what that does and I'd love
your your reaction to this it it it
clarifies your intent so I don't go
away creating false narratives in my
head and stories and this is where I
think stuff can go real sideways and
mole Hills can turn to mountains when we
don't take a small thing severity level
two out of a 10 and and talk about it
and and squash it and then what if it
happened today and I didn't say anything
and then the story gets bigger in my
head oh he's talking over me he's doing
that that wasn't true and the Curiosity
I had to understand your intention there
it just stops those narratives that can
just snowball and I've seen it over and
over and over and over in work
environment ments where relationships
can get ruined over something that's not
even
real yeah I so it's so true Kelly that
for whatever reason humans are just
awful at communicating constructive
feedback we just we just are and we're
bad at talking about it and I think the
reason why because the deliverer doesn't
want to hurt the other person's ego and
the receiver doesn't want to have their
ego hurt I think that's all around ego
and you know one of the books that I
read that changed my life is ego is the
enemy um by Ryan holiday and highly
encourage uh our audience to pick it up
it completely changed my life like 10 15
years ago and that's the reason why I
want so much feedback is because when
you realize that your ego is just this
madeup thing and instead you focus on
just getting better the only way you can
get better is if you know
like where are your faults where are the
things that you can improve yeah and it
gives you such a great like well-rounded
look at the person you're giving
feedback you know because let's just
take you right we're we're honest you're
very decisive you're confident you're
direct you're outspoken like one could
discern he's not take take feedback he
knows everything he's this and that like
you were more Curious than if I told
nine people what I told you you were
more Curious than all nine of them right
you were more open and self-reflecting
and it's just again it shows you a
different part of someone that you might
have had a certain view of you know what
I mean in addition to your ego with
people that you like and you care about
I don't know about you but I think there
is a a very strong worry that the
relationship will change that you know
you have that that moment that's
potentially high stakes it's giving
feedback if they don't react well or you
don't present it correctly ly or a mix
of the both that what could be a good
relationship or someone that you you
want to work closely with and you like
it just shifts and I've seen that be the
biggest reason that a lot of folks are
reluctant to lean into hard messages

relationships hey everyone we'll be

Heretics Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metav view is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decis decisions and
talent leaders can finally take control
of the interview process join Forward

so this is a case to where you know you
had the confidence to deliver it to me
without like you know you asking for my
permission to receive the feedback for
sure but what I actually think is more
common is is people have feedback on
their colleagues and they they're just
not confident enough to share it and so
I'll give you a story about my one of my
things that happened to me at Carta So
like um I'm actually always asking for
feedback specifically from direct
reports it's like one of the things that
I do we actually have like every six
weeks at my current company we actually
do feedback sessions like I I think it's
really important as that a key thing to
help me get better so
anyways um I was asking I'll use his his
name is Adam Jackson um Adam uh was our
like you know he's our comp guy at
Carter for a little while and I was like
hey Adam like I want feedback in like
every two weeks I would ask him I'm like
Adam is there any feedback that you have
for me is there anything that you see
that I could be doing to be better and
he had nothing for like three four
months and then four months and he shows
up in our 101 he goes hey I have
feedback for you and he goes uh everyone
thinks you're a
robot
like swear to God it's exactly how he
said
it and like in that I swear to God in
that moment I was like okay like Adam is
up and coming in his career this was not
packaged the best way like my ego is
like on the floor like internally like I
have the the Kleen xbx out and I'm like
oh my God like this
terrible and dude you're a non player
character dude I swear to God that's
what happened I swear um and so anyways
he you know he tells me he goes look
like everyone thinks you're super
polished you haven't built like
authentic relationships with
people and I was like oh my god dude
like I I think you're totally right and
so part of the reason you get the person
that you're getting today on the Pod and
on LinkedIn is because Adam Jackson gave
me that feedback earlier in my career
and helped me grow as a person and
helped me actually become more
authentically me and without that I I
did have this like veneer and this
polish that like I needed to figure out
how to how to just dampen and like bring
out true Nolan and so that's an example
of like you know in the Moment Like of
course I we hate it but I'm so grateful
for it now and I if we can play that
long game and you know think more in
terms of like the compounding interest
when you get that sort of feedback God
could be powerful for you and your
growth as a person that's a great story
you know one other thing that I I do a
lot and it's just natural it's who I am
is I feel like we we take it so
seriously I mean and it is serious it's
feedback right it's it's stuff if you're
doing well and stuff to make you
better but like come on it's also life
and like we we hold on to it like it's
life or death and leaning into some
humor around it and like it's awkward so
what if like so what it's awkward right
and so I do it with a lot of folks too
like hey this is this is going to be
awkward but the severity again this is a
level three out of a 10 this is not a
huge thing but but listen when when this
happens or this happens just lightening
lightening it a little bit without being
flippant or not caring I think I think
it matters I think folks get so worked
up around it like it's everything and
it's forever and it's not I think what
the reason so I mentioned ego as one
thing I think the other thing is job
security you know people are worried
about constructive feedback meaning it's
like some sort of demerit on their
performance um and you know the other
thing too is like people want to be
perfect you know the best people too
especially like they have this like
Perfection Drive in them and when they
hear that they're not perfect it it
could be very very challenging but that
said you're totally right I think other
tactics the audience can use other than
your scoring out of 10 that's such a
good tactic everybody like people should
 
do is just to carve out feedback
sessions as part of your regular
one-on-one Cadence if you have one-on
ones if not you need to have regular
feedback uh sessions and so as I
mentioned we do it every six weeks I
think that's about the right time
somewhere between like six and nine
weeks is perfect um because this whole
like realtime feedback thing
I am strongly in favor of but again you
just have to understand humans are
humans and whenever they get that like
weirdness feeling about constructive
feedback they tend to just hold on to it
and not deliver yeah and the last thing
I'll offer is don't use the word
feedback like sometimes that word itself
um just takes sucks the air out of the
room right like I don't even think I I
don't even think I said to you last week
and I give you some feedback I was like
youin you definitely said feedback you
defin I did oh that's weird I I usually
will say something like hey can I run
something by you or I just want to see
if I'm if I'm you know tracking or I'm
asking for feedback especially from
direct reports because if if it's a
power relationship and you're like do
any feedback for me it's like no no I'll
be like hey how have things been going
lately anything specific I'm doing
that's helping you more than others any
any any bright spots anything that's
bugging you are not working it just
loosens the conversation it's like oh
this is a conversation between humans
this is not a non-player a non-player
character saying do what feedback for me
yeah it's it could be a turn off the the
last thing I'll mention too is is treat
others the way you want to be treated
and you know the couple examples I'll
use is like one when somebody has like
food in their teeth I always tell them
because I want somebody to tell me like
what could be worse than me like
somebody who I'm with for an hour is
like seeing this thing in my teeth is
letting me run with it like that's awful
let's role play that pretend I have S in
my teeth go Kelly you have something in
your teeth and it's like right it's like
right there like I do it all ask my
friends I do it all and then what
happens is is you'll get it and and
you'll be like thank you and I'll be
like hey I'm only doing it because if it
happens to me you better tell me like so
one in that way um the other one is this
is like a little bit different but I
always wave at my neighbors like when I
drive by I'm like the guy that's like
waving and smiling and even if they
don't wave or smile back like I don't
care because like like all I can do is
control what I can control but I love it
when people do it to me like I love that
sort of so look I think the best people
want to get better and the only way we
can get better is if we hear things that
cover our
blind cool thanks everyone thanks for
the feedback
