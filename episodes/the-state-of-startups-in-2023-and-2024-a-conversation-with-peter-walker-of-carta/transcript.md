right into it I keep hearing from VC's
 
right into it I keep hearing from VC's
that they're sitting on the most dry
 
that they're sitting on the most dry
powder ever and so I would just love for
 
powder ever and so I would just love for
you to talk to us about where did VC
 
you to talk to us about where did VC
Capital go in
 
Capital go in
 
historically noan what do you mean by
 
historically noan what do you mean by
dry powder not everyone might know let's
 
dry powder not everyone might know let's
start there noan yeah yeah so dry powder
 
start there noan yeah yeah so dry powder
is they raised a bunch of money from LPS
 
is they raised a bunch of money from LPS
that is now still sitting generally in
 
that is now still sitting generally in
like the LP's pocket because the capital
 
like the LP's pocket because the capital
hasn't been called by VCS to then go put
 
hasn't been called by VCS to then go put
into companies that's what dry powder
 
into companies that's what dry powder
means yep y exactly so as you mentioned
 
means yep y exactly so as you mentioned
VCS have committed or LPS have committed
 
VCS have committed or LPS have committed
a lot of money over you know the numbers
 
a lot of money over you know the numbers
that you hear thrown around are 200
 
that you hear thrown around are 200
billion plus dollars to the VC asset
 
billion plus dollars to the VC asset
class but that money has yet to be
 
class but that money has yet to be
called to be put to work investing in
 
called to be put to work investing in
startups so what is this dry powder what
 
startups so what is this dry powder what
does this really mean for Founders and
 
does this really mean for Founders and
how do we go through look if we just
 
how do we go through look if we just
compare the general gist of what
 
compare the general gist of what
happened in 2023 it wasn't a good year
 
happened in 2023 it wasn't a good year
on Carta the collective carda companies
 
on Carta the collective carda companies
which is something like 40,000 startups
 
which is something like 40,000 startups
or so now in 2021 those companies raised
 
or so now in 2021 those companies raised
$220 billion in 2023 they raised 65
 
$220 billion in 2023 they raised 65
so that is a gigantic draw so VCS are
 
so that is a gigantic draw so VCS are
not deploying Capital at the same rate
 
not deploying Capital at the same rate
that they were in the last two years
 
that they were in the last two years
hands down for sure now what a lot of
 
hands down for sure now what a lot of
Founders then say is well okay but
 
Founders then say is well okay but
they've they've committed the LPS have
 
they've they've committed the LPS have
committed this Capital so certainly it's
 
committed this Capital so certainly it's
going to get deployed at some point and
 
going to get deployed at some point and
the points that I always make are two
 
the points that I always make are two
things one that doesn't have to happen
 
things one that doesn't have to happen
on a timeline that's useful to the
 
on a timeline that's useful to the
founder the VCS can just not deploy it
 
founder the VCS can just not deploy it
for a long time much longer than the
 
for a long time much longer than the
company can generally stay vent and two
 
company can generally stay vent and two
and more importantly a lot of that
 
and more importantly a lot of that
capital is going to go to different
 
capital is going to go to different
places rather than net new companies
 
places rather than net new companies
it's going to be spent on Bridges and
 
it's going to be spent on Bridges and
extensions for current portfolio
 
extensions for current portfolio
companies it's going to go into
 
companies it's going to go into
convertible notes and safes and it's
 
convertible notes and safes and it's
going to go do a work to keep companies
 
going to go do a work to keep companies
that these VCS already invested in alive
 
that these VCS already invested in alive
and that is a different thing than hey
 
and that is a different thing than hey
we're going to invest into you know six
 
we're going to invest into you know six
new series a companies this year so a
 
new series a companies this year so a
lot of that dry powder is never going to
 
lot of that dry powder is never going to
really come into play for a lot of
 
really come into play for a lot of
founders
 
founders
that's super interesting so now tell me
 
that's super interesting so now tell me
about the distribution so and what I'm
 
about the distribution so and what I'm
most interested in is early stage so
 
most interested in is early stage so
call it like seed series a grow stages
 
call it like seed series a grow stages
you know that b to Z Zone and then late
 
you know that b to Z Zone and then late
stages D and
 
stages D and
Beyond what did it look like in 2023
 
Beyond what did it look like in 2023
compared to what you saw
 
compared to what you saw
historically so let's take 20 let's just
 
historically so let's take 20 let's just
say 2019 as like the pre-bubble times is
 
say 2019 as like the pre-bubble times is
 
in series a another call it 28 to 30% of
 
in series a another call it 28 to 30% of
capital went to series D and Beyond so
 
capital went to series D and Beyond so
that's 30 30 and then like a little bit
 
that's 30 30 and then like a little bit
more into the midstage it was pretty
 
more into the midstage it was pretty
fairly equally split a third a third a
 
fairly equally split a third a third a
third in
 
third in
 
went to early stage and only 14 went to
 
went to early stage and only 14 went to
late stage so what does that mean that
 
late stage so what does that mean that
means that there are way fewer late
 
means that there are way fewer late
stage rounds and many many fewer hundred
 
stage rounds and many many fewer hundred
million plus rounds happening than there
 
million plus rounds happening than there
used to be there's also fewer seed and
 
used to be there's also fewer seed and
series a rounds happening but they just
 
series a rounds happening but they just
did they held up relatively better so
 
did they held up relatively better so
the total mix shifted early but if
 
the total mix shifted early but if
you're talking about again if the number
 
you're talking about again if the number
is what 200$ 250 billion dollars that
 
is what 200$ 250 billion dollars that
that amount of capital cannot be
 
that amount of capital cannot be
invested into early stage startups there
 
invested into early stage startups there
are not enough early stage startups to
 
are not enough early stage startups to
take that money in it's an investor
 
take that money in it's an investor
who's used to writing $15 million checks
 
who's used to writing $15 million checks
is not suddenly just going to start
 
is not suddenly just going to start
writing $2 million checks for all these
 
writing $2 million checks for all these
seed stage companies so a lot of that
 
seed stage companies so a lot of that
dry powder again has to go to late stage
 
dry powder again has to go to late stage
and late stage has not popped back up
 
and late stage has not popped back up
yet yeah it's it also validates what I'm
 
yet yeah it's it also validates what I'm
hearing just from my friends in VC which
 
hearing just from my friends in VC which
is there's a lot of alpha in the seed
 
is there's a lot of alpha in the seed
and series a stage which basically means
 
and series a stage which basically means
like if I put in an early check uh it is
 
like if I put in an early check uh it is
more likely to fail but the outcome on
 
more likely to fail but the outcome on
it could be massive versus now the later
 
it could be massive versus now the later
stage companies right now it doesn't
 
stage companies right now it doesn't
appear like they're perceive to have the
 
appear like they're perceive to have the
same amount of alpha like if I put in
 
same amount of alpha like if I put in
$100 million into a series D like am I
 
$100 million into a series D like am I
going to like what's my opportunity to
 
going to like what's my opportunity to
get a 10x on that right so potentially
 
get a 10x on that right so potentially
more early stage Investments with the
 
more early stage Investments with the
risk of losing some better than one big
 
risk of losing some better than one big
investment yes but the problem is
 
investment yes but the problem is
there's just you know if you're just
 
there's just you know if you're just
going to say everyone invests in the
 
going to say everyone invests in the
early stage that also isn't really a
 
early stage that also isn't really a
solution for Venture as a whole you know
 
solution for Venture as a whole you know
like not everyone can come down to the
 
like not everyone can come down to the
early stage and it is why at some early
 
early stage and it is why at some early
stages especially here in San Francisco
 
stages especially here in San Francisco
and Silicon Valley Broadley some of
 
and Silicon Valley Broadley some of
these price Dynamics are wacky there's
 
these price Dynamics are wacky there's
enough competition at the early stage
 
enough competition at the early stage
that the valuations are actually pretty
 
that the valuations are actually pretty
high right now you would think they
 
high right now you would think they
would have come down a lot they really
 
would have come down a lot they really
didn't at least for seed rounds and
 
didn't at least for seed rounds and
series a rounds they're they're close to
 
series a rounds they're they're close to
as high as they've ever been on a median
 
as high as they've ever been on a median
basis so so a lot of competition at the
 
basis so so a lot of competition at the
early stage and then of course the the
 
early stage and then of course the the
question remains do companies grow
 
question remains do companies grow
radically differently in this age of AI
 
radically differently in this age of AI
than they used to will they need as much
 
than they used to will they need as much
late stage Capital like there's a lot of
 
late stage Capital like there's a lot of
Uncertain questions for late stage VC in
 
Uncertain questions for late stage VC in
particular and question Peter I mean a
 
particular and question Peter I mean a
lot of these later stage companies
 
lot of these later stage companies
CDE they're kind of stuck yeah right now
 
CDE they're kind of stuck yeah right now
like they should have been public two
 
like they should have been public two
years ago right they're they're kind of
 
years ago right they're they're kind of
waiting maybe they're thinking about
 
waiting maybe they're thinking about
raising next year the year after because
 
raising next year the year after because
of everything in the macro do you think
 
of everything in the macro do you think
they're gonna have a harder time raising
 
they're gonna have a harder time raising
how do you see that I do um some of them
 
how do you see that I do um some of them
are putting off raising because they can
 
are putting off raising because they can
some of them are putting off raising
 
some of them are putting off raising
because they're doing everything they
 
because they're doing everything they
can to raise and no one wants to give
 
can to raise and no one wants to give
them more money right now but if you
 
them more money right now but if you
look at the public markets multiples on
 
look at the public markets multiples on
SAS companies if you just use that as a
 
SAS companies if you just use that as a
as a proxy for the market as a whole
 
as a proxy for the market as a whole
have come down a huge amount and we're
 
have come down a huge amount and we're
seeing historically low rates of IPOs
 
seeing historically low rates of IPOs
now maybe Reddit changes things that was
 
now maybe Reddit changes things that was
a that was that went off really well it
 
a that was that went off really well it
seems like so that's fantastic we need
 
seems like so that's fantastic we need
some more momentum on the IPO Market to
 
some more momentum on the IPO Market to
really get back to health but there's
 
really get back to health but there's
late stage companies who are taking
 
late stage companies who are taking
Bridge rounds taking down rounds they're
 
Bridge rounds taking down rounds they're
radically changing because everything
 
radically changing because everything
has radically changed around them if
 
has radically changed around them if
they grew up in an era of low interest
 
they grew up in an era of low interest
rates maybe their business model doesn't
 
rates maybe their business model doesn't
work as well in the hair of high
 
work as well in the hair of high
interest rates it's a it's a major shift
 
interest rates it's a it's a major shift
the way that we talk about it at card is
 
the way that we talk about it at card is
this is a wonderful time to start a
 
this is a wonderful time to start a
company it is a pretty difficult time to
 
company it is a pretty difficult time to
grow one if you had already started in
 
grow one if you had already started in
that old old world that's really well
 
that old old world that's really well
said let's talk about startup deaths so
 
said let's talk about startup deaths so
the unfortunate reality is many startups
 
the unfortunate reality is many startups
are shutting down right now I I just
 
are shutting down right now I I just
want to hear like what does the data
 
want to hear like what does the data
look like like what are you guys seeing
 
look like like what are you guys seeing
with the c
 
with the c
data it's it's not pretty for sure 2023
 
data it's it's not pretty for sure 2023
was the worst year for startup shutdowns
 
was the worst year for startup shutdowns
on Carta uh since we were a company 2013
 
on Carta uh since we were a company 2013
is when started so worst year and
 
is when started so worst year and
unfortunately January 2024 was the worst
 
unfortunately January 2024 was the worst
month so I'm not sure that it's going to
 
month so I'm not sure that it's going to
be the case that this slows down in 2024
 
be the case that this slows down in 2024
now a lot of people want us to produce
 
now a lot of people want us to produce
what's called like a startup failure
 
what's called like a startup failure
rate what percent of startups went out
 
rate what percent of startups went out
of business in any quarter or something
 
of business in any quarter or something
like that the difficulty with that is
 
like that the difficulty with that is
it's really hard to get a stable
 
it's really hard to get a stable
denominator for that rate because moris
 
denominator for that rate because moris
are joining card all the time there's a
 
are joining card all the time there's a
lot of start being created etc etc what
 
lot of start being created etc etc what
we can what I can tell you is 2023 was
 
we can what I can tell you is 2023 was
the worst year for shutdowns for every
 
the worst year for shutdowns for every
single cohort year of startups on Carta
 
single cohort year of startups on Carta
so for instance if you were founded in
 
so for instance if you were founded in
 
shut down 2023 if you were founded in
 
shut down 2023 if you were founded in
 
it was the worst year for startups of
 
it was the worst year for startups of
all ages which tells me that it was just
 
all ages which tells me that it was just
a really difficult year for shutdowns a
 
a really difficult year for shutdowns a
lot of companies didn't make it through
 
lot of companies didn't make it through
the change from Old World to new world
 
the change from Old World to new world
that makes me sad like I feel sad it's
 
that makes me sad like I feel sad it's
super sad and I don't like you know one
 
super sad and I don't like you know one
of the things that you hear when you
 
of the things that you hear when you
talk about startup shutdowns and
 
talk about startup shutdowns and
everything is well it two words come up
 
everything is well it two words come up
that I don't love one is tourist like oh
 
that I don't love one is tourist like oh
those were tourist Founders or they
 
those were tourist Founders or they
didn't get into it for the right reasons
 
didn't get into it for the right reasons
which is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I I hate that
 
which is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I I hate that
and two is this is a return to health
 
and two is this is a return to health
and it's a good thing which I have to
 
and it's a good thing which I have to
say like might be true if you're looking
 
say like might be true if you're looking
at this as a economic eem but it's not
 
at this as a economic eem but it's not
these are people these Founders were to
 
these are people these Founders were to
do something great they were employing
 
do something great they were employing
people like let's be a little bit more
 
people like let's be a little bit more
empathetic to how difficult a startup
 
empathetic to how difficult a startup
shutdown can be on a buch people H
 
shutdown can be on a buch people H
humans yes
 
humans yes
totally so then the big question is if
 
totally so then the big question is if
 
seen for startup deaths on Carta what is
 
seen for startup deaths on Carta what is
 
like my instinct is that it'll
 
like my instinct is that it'll
be it again will be worse than 2023 what
 
be it again will be worse than 2023 what
I'm hoping is that it won't be that much
 
I'm hoping is that it won't be that much
worse so the jump from 2022 to 2023 was
 
worse so the jump from 2022 to 2023 was
about two times um in terms of number of
 
about two times um in terms of number of
startup shutdown 2023 to 2024 I'm hoping
 
startup shutdown 2023 to 2024 I'm hoping
for a reduction in the growth rates is
 
for a reduction in the growth rates is
perhaps the best we can hope for
 
perhaps the best we can hope for
look the the the Crux of it is if
 
look the the the Crux of it is if
interest rates changed in early 2022 we
 
interest rates changed in early 2022 we
are now effectively two years on from
 
are now effectively two years on from
that period VCS in many cases probably
 
that period VCS in many cases probably
gave their portfolio companies a little
 
gave their portfolio companies a little
bit more leeway they were more willing
 
bit more leeway they were more willing
to do a bridge or an extension saying
 
to do a bridge or an extension saying
look things changed on you we understand
 
look things changed on you we understand
that here's a little bit more cash like
 
that here's a little bit more cash like
hopefully you can make it to the next
 
hopefully you can make it to the next
round my instinct is that sort of
 
round my instinct is that sort of
behavior won't be as available to people
 
behavior won't be as available to people
in 2024 they'll look around and say look
 
in 2024 they'll look around and say look
you're just not going to make it like in
 
you're just not going to make it like in
their mind throw good money after bad so
 
their mind throw good money after bad so
it's it's my gut is that there's going
 
it's it's my gut is that there's going
to be fewer extensions fewer Bridges and
 
to be fewer extensions fewer Bridges and
more shutdowns this year hey everyone
 
more shutdowns this year hey everyone
we'll be right back in a moment after a

you so shutdown is one of the potential
 
you so shutdown is one of the potential
outcomes the other potential outcome is

merger acquisition yep what is what does
 
merger acquisition yep what is what does
the data look like for m&amp;a because the
 
the data look like for m&amp;a because the
story that Founders I think want to tell
 
story that Founders I think want to tell
themselves is like oh well you know we
 
themselves is like oh well you know we
won't be able to raise so like the next
 
won't be able to raise so like the next
thing we're going to do is sell the
 
thing we're going to do is sell the
company right and I I keep hearing
 
company right and I I keep hearing
anecdotally the m&amp;a market is not what
 
anecdotally the m&amp;a market is not what
people think it is our data backs up the
 
people think it is our data backs up the
anecdote so it's not it's not impossible
 
anecdote so it's not it's not impossible
right there are companies that are being
 
right there are companies that are being
bought every day every quarter it's
 
bought every day every quarter it's
probably about 150 companies a quarter
 
probably about 150 companies a quarter
are purchased that that are acquired I
 
are purchased that that are acquired I
should say that are cter companies the
 
should say that are cter companies the
problem is that's basically flat from
 
problem is that's basically flat from
where it was in 2022 and I don't see
 
where it was in 2022 and I don't see
maybe there'll be an m&amp;a boom this year
 
maybe there'll be an m&amp;a boom this year
it's possible um the other point to make
 
it's possible um the other point to make
to Founders who are thinking that is
 
to Founders who are thinking that is
that cannot you can't pivot from one
 
that cannot you can't pivot from one
thing to another without having laid
 
thing to another without having laid
some ground so if if you're looking for
 
some ground so if if you're looking for
a fundraising round and don't raise it
 
a fundraising round and don't raise it
and you only have three months left in
 
and you only have three months left in
this company's life before you run out
 
this company's life before you run out
of money it's incredibly unlikely that
 
of money it's incredibly unlikely that
you'll be able to no Lage period one you
 
you'll be able to no Lage period one you
have no leverage and two you haven't
 
have no leverage and two you haven't
started the conversations yet these
 
started the conversations yet these
things don't happen in a period of weeks
 
things don't happen in a period of weeks
yeah and and I mean companies right they
 
yeah and and I mean companies right they
get bought not sold I mean it's kind of
 
get bought not sold I mean it's kind of
a i my double click on that Peter that's
 
a i my double click on that Peter that's
that was my question is m&amp;a my double
 
that was my question is m&amp;a my double
click under that underneath that is
 
click under that underneath that is
private Equity any data or point of view
 
private Equity any data or point of view
on that that piece of the pie PE is
 
on that that piece of the pie PE is
definitely one of the bigger buyers of
 
definitely one of the bigger buyers of
startups PE other startups big Tech
 
startups PE other startups big Tech
probably Encompass most of the purchases
 
probably Encompass most of the purchases
of these these companies PE has been
 
of these these companies PE has been
again it's definitely it's not the
 
again it's definitely it's not the
Roaring 20s like it's they're not
 
Roaring 20s like it's they're not
purchases happening all the time time
 
purchases happening all the time time
but it's kind of a steady looking at
 
but it's kind of a steady looking at
things there are rollups happening Etc
 
things there are rollups happening Etc
um unfortunately I I think I think a lot
 
um unfortunately I I think I think a lot
of companies are going to try to sell
 
of companies are going to try to sell
themselves and are going to be
 
themselves and are going to be
disappointed that's my instinct about
 
disappointed that's my instinct about
this coming year may be more startups
 
this coming year may be more startups
get acquired yes but the other thing is
 
get acquired yes but the other thing is
unfortunately we don't have the ability
 
unfortunately we don't have the ability
to tell whether or not an acquisition
 
to tell whether or not an acquisition
was quote unquote quality so we we don't
 
was quote unquote quality so we we don't
know if that was hey you're just going
 
know if that was hey you're just going
to basically Aqua hire some people and
 
to basically Aqua hire some people and
nobody's going to make a lot of money or
 
nobody's going to make a lot of money or
if it was a real significant exit for a
 
if it was a real significant exit for a
lot of people on the cap table we really
 
lot of people on the cap table we really
can't see that so my gut is a lot of
 
can't see that so my gut is a lot of
Acquisitions that are happening are also
 
Acquisitions that are happening are also
just Aqua hires or they're not actually
 
just Aqua hires or they're not actually
meaningfully impacting the the wealth of
 
meaningfully impacting the the wealth of
the people that were in that company
 
the people that were in that company
beforehand yeah it's so interesting
 
beforehand yeah it's so interesting
because that ends up hurting the Venture
 
because that ends up hurting the Venture
ecosystem right like if you're putting
 
ecosystem right like if you're putting
Capital into the Venture ecosystem and
 
Capital into the Venture ecosystem and
you're losing money as an investor yeah
 
you're losing money as an investor yeah
and you're just less likely to do that
 
and you're just less likely to do that

around employment in startups can you
tell us what that data looks like
 
tell us what that data looks like
absolutely so again when we talk about
 
absolutely so again when we talk about
call it a universe of on the order of 40
 
call it a universe of on the order of 40
to 45,000 startups on CA and you say
 
to 45,000 startups on CA and you say
okay if we just look collectively across
 
okay if we just look collectively across
those startups how many people do they
 
those startups how many people do they
hire every year um in 2019 you know
 
hire every year um in 2019 you know
fewer startups on Carta but they hired
 
fewer startups on Carta but they hired
about 280,000 people and about 125,000
 
about 280,000 people and about 125,000
people left either through layoff or
 
people left either through layoff or
left by choice whatever they Departed
 
left by choice whatever they Departed
the company so that's a good ratio right
 
the company so that's a good ratio right
in 2021 and 2022 startups on Carta hired
 
in 2021 and 2022 startups on Carta hired
half a million people basically 520,000
 
half a million people basically 520,000
each year so wild growth like you know
 
each year so wild growth like you know
startups were booming headcount was
 
startups were booming headcount was
growing across all these places good
 
growing across all these places good
time
 
time
 
to 260,000
 
to 260,000
hes cut in half so that was the hiring
 
hes cut in half so that was the hiring
market last year and then if you pair
 
market last year and then if you pair
that with the departures Market it was
 
that with the departures Market it was
more people left startups on Carta than
 
more people left startups on Carta than
joined them in 2023 so the industry the
 
joined them in 2023 so the industry the
whole asset class got smaller in terms
 
whole asset class got smaller in terms
of headcount last year that's the first
 
of headcount last year that's the first
time that's happened ever in our data uh
 
time that's happened ever in our data uh
you know we we didn't have a ton of data
 
you know we we didn't have a ton of data
on hiring and something back in 2013 but
 
on hiring and something back in 2013 but
in the last five six years that's the
 
in the last five six years that's the
first time that's happened ever yeah
 
first time that's happened ever yeah
yeah and a lot of those as we've seen
 
yeah and a lot of those as we've seen
from the headlines a lot of those
 
from the headlines a lot of those
departures were layoffs not departures
 
departures were layoffs not departures
by choice so you know 2024 there is some
 
by choice so you know 2024 there is some
Rumblings that people are hiring again
 
Rumblings that people are hiring again
do you have any early data on
 
do you have any early data on
 
January was GNA is going to be a decent
 
January was GNA is going to be a decent
month for hiring uh the the the long and
 
month for hiring uh the the the long and
short of it is like layoffs are down
 
short of it is like layoffs are down
from where they were peing in early 23
 
from where they were peing in early 23
but they're not gone they haven't
 
but they're not gone they haven't
subsided completely and it's uh my
 
subsided completely and it's uh my
instinct here is that a lot of startups
 
instinct here is that a lot of startups
really took the shift and the advice
 
really took the shift and the advice
candidly from VCS to scrutinize
 
candidly from VCS to scrutinize
headcount very closely be incredibly
 
headcount very closely be incredibly
Capital efficient when it comes to your
 
Capital efficient when it comes to your
growth they've taken that to heart and
 
growth they've taken that to heart and
so I would be reluctant to bet on a huge
 
so I would be reluctant to bet on a huge
hiring uptick this year I think it'll be
 
hiring uptick this year I think it'll be
better than 2023 but maybe not
 
better than 2023 but maybe not
meaningfully better yeah and that that
 
meaningfully better yeah and that that
scrutiny I mean it was it was more like
 
scrutiny I mean it was it was more like
a mandate yeah like a suggestion uh and
 
a mandate yeah like a suggestion uh and
I guess my my question underneath that
 
I guess my my question underneath that
data Peter is I know it's all Tech but
 
data Peter is I know it's all Tech but
is there any trends that you're seeing
 
is there any trends that you're seeing
in your data on type of Industry
 
in your data on type of Industry
geolocation anything like that right
 
geolocation anything like that right
right AI security tend to be more
 
right AI security tend to be more
healthy than others anything you can
 
healthy than others anything you can
offer on that front yeah I I think the
 
offer on that front yeah I I think the
AI story holds up pretty well here you
 
AI story holds up pretty well here you
know AI companies raised at higher rates
 
know AI companies raised at higher rates
for higher valuations and probably hired
 
for higher valuations and probably hired
a few more people than other sectors
 
a few more people than other sectors
when we did this there's a heat map in
 
when we did this there's a heat map in
the report where we looked at the
 
the report where we looked at the
various Industries and whether or not
 
various Industries and whether or not
they were growing so we just we did a
 
they were growing so we just we did a
ratio of new hires to Dearing people so
 
ratio of new hires to Dearing people so
if it's at one you're just flat new
 
if it's at one you're just flat new
hires in departures equal out more than
 
hires in departures equal out more than
one you're growing less than one you're
 
one you're growing less than one you're
shrinking the places that were still
 
shrinking the places that were still
growing as of the end of last year

I'm not sure but I I thought it was
 
I'm not sure but I I thought it was
interesting that the kind of the
 
interesting that the kind of the
industries that we're dealing with more
 
industries that we're dealing with more
real world stuff were still growing if

have shifted I mean there are whole
 
have shifted I mean there are whole
categories of things that VCS are no
 
categories of things that VCS are no
longer really interested in I think the

easiest example there is things like DTC
 
easiest example there is things like DTC
retail you know if you look at what all
 
retail you know if you look at what all
birds or some of the other startups are
 
birds or some of the other startups are
now worth on the public markets like
 
now worth on the public markets like
there's not going to be a lot of VCS
 
there's not going to be a lot of VCS
back that sort of company anymore what
 
back that sort of company anymore what
why would you when the public markets
 
why would you when the public markets
aren't believing in them at all um so
 
aren't believing in them at all um so
the changes in public do filter down
 
the changes in public do filter down
into private it may take a little while

decision making it's really interesting
 
decision making it's really interesting
for our audience because a lot of the
 
for our audience because a lot of the
folks that Kelly and I talk to and a lot
 
folks that Kelly and I talk to and a lot
of our listeners ask us like hey what
 
of our listeners ask us like hey what
types of companies should I be looking

but it does mean that when you look
underneath the hood those companies need
 
underneath the hood those companies need
to either be profitable or have a path

your point about potential job Seekers a
 
your point about potential job Seekers a
lot of the best advice that we give and
 
lot of the best advice that we give and
have seen given to potential job Seekers
 
have seen given to potential job Seekers
is to approach your next company as

if they're a seed or series a startup
 
if they're a seed or series a startup
how many how many series B and series C
 
how many how many series B and series C
startups are in that space is there
 
startups are in that space is there
Capital being devoted to that place like
 
Capital being devoted to that place like
you can do some of this research on your
 
you can do some of this research on your
own and give you know if you're betting
 
own and give you know if you're betting
on this new startup for your job you are
 
on this new startup for your job you are
inherently betting on that equity and
 
inherently betting on that equity and
that means you're making an investment
 
that means you're making an investment
decision uh just like an adviser would

yes I'll take it yes I'll take the level
of business Acumen jump that I think all
 
of business Acumen jump that I think all
these folks need to make now is pretty
 
these folks need to make now is pretty
drastic and some of these questions you
 
drastic and some of these questions you
just mentioned Peter noan HR people
 
just mentioned Peter noan HR people
don't even know how to ask them half AG
 
don't even know how to ask them half AG
I don't know if there's place to learn
 
I don't know if there's place to learn
this stuff but you're so right and I
 
this stuff but you're so right and I
don't think that candidates or HR people
 
don't think that candidates or HR people
have been approaching these things as an
 
have been approaching these things as an
investor for a long time it's such a
 
investor for a long time it's such a
good frame Peter I love the frame of a
 
good frame Peter I love the frame of a
candidate should evaluate a company in
 
candidate should evaluate a company in
this the same way an investor would yeah
 
this the same way an investor would yeah
I think one of the discrepancies with
 
I think one of the discrepancies with
that model is investors kind of care
 
that model is investors kind of care
about the last price but they're going
 
about the last price but they're going
to come in and set a new price sure sure
 
to come in and set a new price sure sure
and so I I get a lot of friends who are
 
and so I I get a lot of friends who are
who are interviewing at larger pre-ipo
 
who are interviewing at larger pre-ipo
tech
 
tech
companies whose valuations were set in
 
companies whose valuations were set in
 
reset yep and like the reality unless
 
reset yep and like the reality unless
they're growing into it which very few
 
they're growing into it which very few
companies are yeah most companies are if
 
companies are yeah most companies are if
they are going to survive are taking
 
they are going to survive are taking
down rounds I mean even the best
 
down rounds I mean even the best
companies like I know ramp took it down
 
companies like I know ramp took it down
round like are doing this yep and so
 
round like are doing this yep and so
what's your advice to job Seekers that
 
what's your advice to job Seekers that
are talking to companies that raised at
 
are talking to companies that raised at
Peak but haven't reset the
 
Peak but haven't reset the
valuation I mean this is the this is the
 
valuation I mean this is the this is the
sort of Catch 22 with today's job market
 
sort of Catch 22 with today's job market
because I have a lot of advice that I
 
because I have a lot of advice that I
could give to candidates about how you
 
could give to candidates about how you
need to approach these conversations the
 
need to approach these conversations the
sort of data that you want from these
 
sort of data that you want from these
companies but I'm cognizant of the fact
 
companies but I'm cognizant of the fact
that in many cases this is going to be
 
that in many cases this is going to be
your only offer and it's difficult to
 
your only offer and it's difficult to
really feel like you have the capacity
 
really feel like you have the capacity
to push in those
 
to push in those
conversations when perhaps this is the
 
conversations when perhaps this is the
only job opportunity you have on on hand
 
only job opportunity you have on on hand
at the moment and you you really want a
 
at the moment and you you really want a
job like I want to so that upfront like
 
job like I want to so that upfront like
caveat these are tough conversations to
 
caveat these are tough conversations to
have sometimes as a candidate that said
 
have sometimes as a candidate that said
if a company is only giving you their
 
if a company is only giving you their
valuation after the last round of
 
valuation after the last round of
funding and it's been three years heads
 
funding and it's been three years heads
up like like the market has completely
 
up like like the market has completely
shifted it may not be worth that much uh
 
shifted it may not be worth that much uh
the the number one thing and this is
 
the the number one thing and this is
less common at the very late stage Tech
 
less common at the very late stage Tech
but if they are giving you just a simple
 
but if they are giving you just a simple
number of shares that is not enough
 
number of shares that is not enough
information you have no idea how those
 
information you have no idea how those
shares work you need at least at the
 
shares work you need at least at the
very least you need the number of shares

so you can have an of the percentage
 
so you can have an of the percentage
ownership percentage ownership is the

thing that you want the other thing no
 
thing that you want the other thing no
and you and I have gone back and forth
 
and you and I have gone back and forth
on this a little bit you can talk about
 
on this a little bit you can talk about
investing schedules you can talk about
 
investing schedules you can talk about
post termination exercise periods
 
post termination exercise periods
there's a lot of ins and outs with the
 
there's a lot of ins and outs with the
grants one thing I'm honestly not sure
 
grants one thing I'm honestly not sure
if a lot of HR folks can answer but I
 
if a lot of HR folks can answer but I
love candidates who can push on this the
 
love candidates who can push on this the
question I always tell candidates to ask
 
question I always tell candidates to ask
is if or when this company goes public
 
is if or when this company goes public
or gets acquired has an exit of some
 
or gets acquired has an exit of some
kind what is the minimum price per share
 
kind what is the minimum price per share
it needs to achieve
 
it needs to achieve
for people with common stock to make a
 
for people with common stock to make a
profit what that means is you do not
 
profit what that means is you do not
care whether or not the investors make a
 
care whether or not the investors make a
profit oftentimes investor shares have
 
profit oftentimes investor shares have
preference they're called preferred
 
preference they're called preferred
shares and they may make a profit such
 
shares and they may make a profit such
to such a degree that the common shares
 
to such a degree that the common shares
what the founder and the employees hold
 
what the founder and the employees hold
Come Away with nothing so just getting
 
Come Away with nothing so just getting
an idea of what the company's valued at
 
an idea of what the company's valued at
now doesn't tell you anything about the
 
now doesn't tell you anything about the
liquidation preferences in that cap
 
liquidation preferences in that cap
table all sorts of stuff so I I love
 
table all sorts of stuff so I I love
that question about what do common what
 
that question about what do common what
does common stock need to make a profit
 
does common stock need to make a profit
because it gets at the real Crux of the
 
because it gets at the real Crux of the
argument there how much can That Vary
 
argument there how much can That Vary
Peter like I mean it can be the answer
 
Peter like I mean it can be the answer
to that question look in a lot of
 
to that question look in a lot of
companies it's not actually that
 
companies it's not actually that
variable in some companies it could be a
 
variable in some companies it could be a
 
preferen is basically for everyone
 
preferen is basically for everyone
listening a 1x liquidation preference
 
listening a 1x liquidation preference
which is very common across Venture
 
which is very common across Venture
means hey on an exit the investors get
 
means hey on an exit the investors get
paid back first whatever they invested
 
paid back first whatever they invested
and then the rest of it is shared
 
and then the rest of it is shared
amongst all shares as common stock a 2X
 
amongst all shares as common stock a 2X
liquidation preference means the
 
liquidation preference means the
investor gets their money back and then
 
investor gets their money back and then
again one once more their money back and
 
again one once more their money back and
then everybody else shares in it so if
 
then everybody else shares in it so if
you have an exit for $500 million and
 
you have an exit for $500 million and
your company had $200 million invested
 
your company had $200 million invested
and that investor had a 2X liquidation
 
and that investor had a 2X liquidation
preference guess what you're only going
 
preference guess what you're only going
to be sharing a 100 million out of that
 
to be sharing a 100 million out of that
 
so it can be a really big deal oh my God
 
so it can be a really big deal oh my God
I just stop I have never asked that I've
 
I just stop I have never asked that I've
asked every question you can think of
 
asked every question you can think of
around Equity I have never asked that
 
around Equity I have never asked that
question did you Nolan did you ask that
 
question did you Nolan did you ask that
question at CA so I'll tell you a story
 
question at CA so I'll tell you a story
um when I was at door Dash it was really
 
um when I was at door Dash it was really
brutal raising our series C and when we
 
brutal raising our series C and when we
raised it uh I'll never forget this is
 
raised it uh I'll never forget this is
like you know Tony came out and you know
 
like you know Tony came out and you know
introduced the round I think it was like
 
introduced the round I think it was like
 
that's how we announced it to the
 
that's how we announced it to the
company
 
company
Tech crunch then ran a story the next
 
Tech crunch then ran a story the next
day and said that there was a 3X
 
day and said that there was a 3X
liquidation preference and then they
 
liquidation preference and then they
described it I had I had no idea what
 
described it I had I had no idea what
this meant at the time they described it
 
this meant at the time they described it
which is exactly what Peter said which
 
which is exactly what Peter said which
is investors would make 3x it basically
 
is investors would make 3x it basically
had to hit a certain price for that
 
had to hit a certain price for that
liquidation preference to go away they
 
liquidation preference to go away they
would make 3x their money before Common
 
would make 3x their money before Common
got paid out and the way I found that
 
got paid out and the way I found that
out was a candidate saw the story on
 
out was a candidate saw the story on
Tech Crunch and asked me about it and
 
Tech Crunch and asked me about it and
then I had to go ask Tony about it and
 
then I had to go ask Tony about it and
what it meant and look to put myself in
 
what it meant and look to put myself in
Tony's shoes most people don't
 
Tony's shoes most people don't
understand
 
understand
this and so you know I I think as a as a
 
this and so you know I I think as a as a
Founder you're less likely to just
 
Founder you're less likely to just
proactively bring this up because it
 
proactively bring this up because it
only causes more questions and confusion
 
only causes more questions and confusion
for people who already don't understand
 
for people who already don't understand
how this works but this is structure
 
how this works but this is structure
like there and and I think Peter the
 
like there and and I think Peter the
next question I want to ask you
 
next question I want to ask you
is it I've been anecdotally hearing
 
is it I've been anecdotally hearing
again that more structure is showing up
 
again that more structure is showing up
in term sheets and so what are you
 
in term sheets and so what are you
seeing is there data that backs that up
 
seeing is there data that backs that up
 
one of many different terms it can be
 
one of many different terms it can be
higher liquidation preference cumulative
 
higher liquidation preference cumulative
dividends participating preferred shares
 
dividends participating preferred shares
there's a lot of different ins and outs
 
there's a lot of different ins and outs
with Venture structure but if we just
 
with Venture structure but if we just
take liquidation preferences as like a
 
take liquidation preferences as like a
starting point it on Carta early stage
 
starting point it on Carta early stage
deal seed in series a only about 3% of
 
deal seed in series a only about 3% of
them have a high liquidation preference
 
them have a high liquidation preference
so very few that's great and that hasn't
 
so very few that's great and that hasn't
really risen much too it hasn't really
 
really risen much too it hasn't really
risen too much in later years so early
 
risen too much in later years so early
stage pretty immune to this growth stage
 
stage pretty immune to this growth stage
series B and series C 2019 5% had high
 
series B and series C 2019 5% had high
liquidation preference 2023 9% du is
 
liquidation preference 2023 9% du is
that every deal no definitely not but a
 
that every deal no definitely not but a
big jump late stage it went from like
 
big jump late stage it went from like
seven or eight% to 177% in 2023 so like
 
seven or eight% to 177% in 2023 so like
wow these jumps matter now a lot of
 
wow these jumps matter now a lot of
investors will say look if the company

long term so a lot of down rounds are
 
long term so a lot of down rounds are
happening that's you know when a startup
 
happening that's you know when a startup
is valued at say a billion and then they
 
is valued at say a billion and then they
take the next round and that next round
 
take the next round and that next round
values them at 700 million that's a Down

companies and Boards can do what's
 
companies and Boards can do what's
called a repricing where they actually
 
called a repricing where they actually
retire that old equity and reissue it to
 
retire that old equity and reissue it to
those employees at the new lower price
 
those employees at the new lower price
so that they have more upside in the
 
so that they have more upside in the
equity and we saw more companies do that
 
equity and we saw more companies do that
over the last year than we've ever seen
 
over the last year than we've ever seen
at mostly late stage mostly pretty
 
at mostly late stage mostly pretty
Advanced companies but it was good it
 
Advanced companies but it was good it
was heartening to see like look there's
 
was heartening to see like look there's
no requirement that they reissue this
 
no requirement that they reissue this
Equity but a lot of companies did take
 
Equity but a lot of companies did take
the position hey we really care about

Equity repriced so yeah there's are
 
Equity repriced so yeah there's are
there are a lot I don't want to paint
 
there are a lot I don't want to paint

there's a ton of Founders who deeply

but the education piece can get really
 
but the education piece can get really
tricky yeah for sure I love that I was
 
tricky yeah for sure I love that I was
going to ask about that we were talking
 
going to ask about that we were talking
with some friends last week Nolan and I
 
with some friends last week Nolan and I
about this and I guess a followup in
 
about this and I guess a followup in
addition to that Peter is are you seeing
 
addition to that Peter is are you seeing
companies late stage that have gone from
 
companies late stage that have gone from
options to rsus like we did two years
 
options to rsus like we did two years
ago go back to options and why would
 
ago go back to options and why would
they do that interesting we haven't seen
 
they do that interesting we haven't seen
a a return to options from rsus really
 
a a return to options from rsus really
quickly the difference between an option
 
quickly the difference between an option
and an RSU basically boils down to if
 
and an RSU basically boils down to if
you are receiving incentive stock
 
you are receiving incentive stock
options which is the majority of startup
 
options which is the majority of startup
employees they are going to have two
 
employees they are going to have two
criteria in order to become real stock
 
criteria in order to become real stock
one they need to be vested and that's
 
one they need to be vested and that's
usually you know four years with a
 
usually you know four years with a
one-year Cliff the standard vesting
 
one-year Cliff the standard vesting
schedule and two they need to be
 
schedule and two they need to be
exercised so you will need to pay out of
 
exercised so you will need to pay out of
pocket some exercise cost to sort of
 
pocket some exercise cost to sort of
take possession of those options rsus
 
take possession of those options rsus
basically remove that second option from
 
basically remove that second option from
they are automatically exercised when
 
they are automatically exercised when
they vest so that's useful in late stage
 
they vest so that's useful in late stage
companies because it locks in a price
 
companies because it locks in a price
for the employee but it can be tough if
 
for the employee but it can be tough if
you have to pay taxes on something that
 
you have to pay taxes on something that
is maybe not going to be worth all that
 
is maybe not going to be worth all that
much in the end or and pay the exercise
 
much in the end or and pay the exercise
cost or not currently liquid it's not
 
cost or not currently liquid it's not
liquid liquidated right now like you
 
liquid liquidated right now like you
can't access liquidity today with that
 
can't access liquidity today with that
 
to our or move back to options once you
 
to our or move back to options once you
started the RSU path but rsus are also
 
started the RSU path but rsus are also
for late stage only really you don't
 
for late stage only really you don't
really touch rsus until you're I don't
 
really touch rsus until you're I don't
know I don't know what the marker might
 
know I don't know what the marker might
be 700 million a billion dollars in
 
be 700 million a billion dollars in
valuation something like that so it
 
valuation something like that so it
doesn't really apply to the earliest
 
doesn't really apply to the earliest
companies yeah um I had I was thinking
 
companies yeah um I had I was thinking
when we were talking about the jumps in
 
when we were talking about the jumps in
the multiple
 
the multiple
 
follow that bouncing ball if we'll see
 
follow that bouncing ball if we'll see
Talent maybe more at the leadership
 
Talent maybe more at the leadership
level choosing earlier stage companies
 
level choosing earlier stage companies
versus the later stage companies right
 
versus the later stage companies right
I'm just thinking like would I choose a
 
I'm just thinking like would I choose a
series e with a 3X or would I choose the
 
series e with a 3X or would I choose the
early series B with a one I wonder if
 
early series B with a one I wonder if
that will have a lagging impact on where
 
that will have a lagging impact on where
the best talent is choosing to go in the
 
the best talent is choosing to go in the
next 18 months that's a really
 
next 18 months that's a really
interesting question I'm not sure we
 
interesting question I'm not sure we
have the data to answer that yet we do
 
have the data to answer that yet we do
have a lot of information on salary and
 
have a lot of information on salary and
Equity trends for for employees both you
 
Equity trends for for employees both you
know VP exec and and then down to the
 
know VP exec and and then down to the
entry level generally
 
entry level generally
speaking
 
speaking
hiring I think for everyone thinking
 
hiring I think for everyone thinking
about their next move like it is true
 
about their next move like it is true
that the executive Market is just
 
that the executive Market is just
functions a bit differently than the
 
functions a bit differently than the
rest of the startup market for one thing
 
rest of the startup market for one thing
it's more National so you're not really
 
it's more National so you're not really
going to pay that VP of engineering that
 
going to pay that VP of engineering that
much less if they're in Boise than San
 
much less if they're in Boise than San
Francisco the way that you might get a
 
Francisco the way that you might get a
pretty solid cost Arbitrage if they're
 
pretty solid cost Arbitrage if they're
an entry-level engineer so that's one
 
an entry-level engineer so that's one
difference and then two
 
difference and then two
yeah the equity functions a bit
 
yeah the equity functions a bit
differently there are sometimes
 
differently there are sometimes
management carve outs like it can get a
 
management carve outs like it can get a
little tricky it's a great question
 
little tricky it's a great question
Kelly and I think it changes the
 
Kelly and I think it changes the
calculus of risk right because
 
calculus of risk right because
theoretically as a company gets later
 
theoretically as a company gets later
stage they get less risky yeah and so
 
stage they get less risky yeah and so
the story you tell yourself is I will
 
the story you tell yourself is I will
have an exit here like the opportunity
 
have an exit here like the opportunity
for me to have a true uh liquidation
 
for me to have a true uh liquidation
event is higher but if there is
 
event is higher but if there is
preference liquidation preferences
 
preference liquidation preferences
involved the calculus on that changes
 
involved the calculus on that changes
right so I think tot I think you're on
 
right so I think tot I think you're on
to something so while while we're on the
 
to something so while while we're on the
thread of startup
 
thread of startup
compensation tell us what you're seeing
 
compensation tell us what you're seeing
in the data with salary
 
in the data with salary
Trends yeah so salary's actually been
 
Trends yeah so salary's actually been
interesting in that not much has
 
interesting in that not much has
happened which perhaps doesn't sound
 
happened which perhaps doesn't sound
interesting at the surface but if you
 
interesting at the surface but if you
think about all the macro changes that
 
think about all the macro changes that
have happened to startups over the last
 
have happened to startups over the last
couple years it was a bit surprising to
 
couple years it was a bit surprising to
see that salaries are if you just
 
see that salaries are if you just
compare say November 2022 to January
 
compare say November 2022 to January
 
that period maybe like a tiny bit up not
 
that period maybe like a tiny bit up not
keeping Pace with inflation by any means
 
keeping Pace with inflation by any means
but also not they haven't declined very
 
but also not they haven't declined very
much and that's the salary Benchmark
 
much and that's the salary Benchmark
that we would suggest for a new the
 
that we would suggest for a new the
average new employee joining a company
 
average new employee joining a company
so in that way I think that's kind of at
 
so in that way I think that's kind of at
least a decent signal for candidates
 
least a decent signal for candidates
like the salaries are still pretty
 
like the salaries are still pretty
strong but they certainly haven't kept
 
strong but they certainly haven't kept
pace with inflation which many
 
pace with inflation which many
candidates are surprised by what about
 
candidates are surprised by what about
Equity yeah so that's where the the
 
Equity yeah so that's where the the
bombshell really drops if you look again
 
bombshell really drops if you look again
that November 2022 to January 2024 the
 
that November 2022 to January 2024 the
average Equity package granted to a new
 
average Equity package granted to a new
employee at a startup is down
 
employee at a startup is down
 
wild and to be clear this isn't because
 
wild and to be clear this isn't because
the company is worthless that's a
 
the company is worthless that's a
separate Dynamic we're talking about
 
separate Dynamic we're talking about
right literally you as if no if I joined
 
right literally you as if no if I joined
in November 22 and Nolan joined in
 
in November 22 and Nolan joined in
January 2024 and we joined at the same
 
January 2024 and we joined at the same
level in the same position at this
 
level in the same position at this
startup Nolan would get 36% less Equity
 
startup Nolan would get 36% less Equity
than I did which is wild do we know why
 
than I did which is wild do we know why
do we know are shareholders just
 
do we know are shareholders just
protecting more like what's the there's
 
protecting more like what's the there's
a couple of reasons why you know this is
 
a couple of reasons why you know this is
a little bit of guessing but educated
 
a little bit of guessing but educated
guessing on our part from Carta so in
 
guessing on our part from Carta so in
the report we proferred a couple reasons
 
the report we proferred a couple reasons
why this might be so first and foremost
 
why this might be so first and foremost
Equity option pools for employees
 
Equity option pools for employees
typically expand as fundraising happens
 
typically expand as fundraising happens
so a lot of companies have not had the
 
so a lot of companies have not had the
opportunity to expand those option pools
 
opportunity to expand those option pools
at all because they haven't fundraised
 
at all because they haven't fundraised
in a long time so they're having to make
 
in a long time so they're having to make
each individual sliver of that pool last
 
each individual sliver of that pool last
longer so that's one two this gets into
 
longer so that's one two this gets into
the hiring Market you know if in 2021
 
the hiring Market you know if in 2021
you wanted to hire this engineer and
 
you wanted to hire this engineer and
they had five offers you were far more
 
they had five offers you were far more
likely to go above your benchmarks for
 
likely to go above your benchmarks for
that Equity than you were today if that
 
that Equity than you were today if that
engineer has no other offers so the top
 
engineer has no other offers so the top
end of the equity Benchmark has kind of
 
end of the equity Benchmark has kind of
been eliminated at a lot of these
 
been eliminated at a lot of these
because the competitive or the the
 
because the competitive or the the
talent Market has just shifted towards
 
talent Market has just shifted towards
employers so those are two reasons I'm
 
employers so those are two reasons I'm
sure that there like the General Air of
 
sure that there like the General Air of
be cash conservative watch your burn
 
be cash conservative watch your burn
also applies to equity um so a lot of
 
also applies to equity um so a lot of
that is happening so it's it's been a
 
that is happening so it's it's been a
major change yeah makes total sense the
 
major change yeah makes total sense the
most interesting part about that data is
 
most interesting part about that data is
that if it's if Equity compensation is
 
that if it's if Equity compensation is
down from
 
down from
 
that hasn't repriced its
 
that hasn't repriced its
valuation like it's almost doubly down
 
valuation like it's almost doubly down
yep because the market valuation is no
 
yep because the market valuation is no
longer tied to the actual Market where
 
longer tied to the actual Market where
it is today Y and now you're getting
 
it is today Y and now you're getting
less equity on top of it so at some
 
less equity on top of it so at some
point a new Mark is going to come in
 
point a new Mark is going to come in
that's likely lower than where the
 
that's likely lower than where the
valuation is today and your Equity is
 
valuation is today and your Equity is
already you said 36% lower yep damn I
 
already you said 36% lower yep damn I
need some more silver linings we can't
 
need some more silver linings we can't
we can't end we can't end like this I
 
we can't end we can't end like this I
don't want to end I don't want to end
 
don't want to end I don't want to end
okay one more one more like uh bad part
 
okay one more one more like uh bad part
of this uh shitty cake before we get to
 
of this uh shitty cake before we get to
like frosting on the top of it um so uh
 
like frosting on the top of it um so uh
one thing to note here is that employees
 
one thing to note here is that employees
are no dummies they have internalize
 
are no dummies they have internalize
this Dynamic and so when it comes up to
 
this Dynamic and so when it comes up to
that period where you want to exercise
 
that period where you want to exercise
your options employees are saying thanks
 
your options employees are saying thanks
but no thanks only about
 
but no thanks only about
 
before they expire right now and so why
 
before they expire right now and so why
would it why would an option expire wow
 
would it why would an option expire wow
maybe you were there for 10 years but
 
maybe you were there for 10 years but
more likely it's because you're leaving
 
more likely it's because you're leaving
so if you think about it you usually
 
so if you think about it you usually
have that 90-day window to exercise so
 
have that 90-day window to exercise so
another another shitty cake that 90day
 
another another shitty cake that 90day
window no we could talk I could talk
 
window no we could talk I could talk
your ear off about how much the post-
 
your ear off about how much the post-
termination exercise window is is
 
termination exercise window is is
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so if you just think about it
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so if you just think about it
in that 90day period only like three and
 
in that 90day period only like three and
four basically employees are letting
 
four basically employees are letting
their Equity go they're just saying
 
their Equity go they're just saying
thanks it's not worth the exercise cost
 
thanks it's not worth the exercise cost
I appreciate being here for two or three
 
I appreciate being here for two or three
years but I'm going to walk away with no
 
years but I'm going to walk away with no
upside in this company which makes
 
upside in this company which makes
especially if you think about a lot of
 
especially if you think about a lot of
those people are faced with that
 
those people are faced with that
decision after they get laid off so if
 
decision after they get laid off so if
you get laid off I'm going to give this
 
you get laid off I'm going to give this
company a little bit more cash to
 
company a little bit more cash to
exercise his Equity no way and so that's
 
exercise his Equity no way and so that's
another like negative bearish signal on
 
another like negative bearish signal on
where people think the value of equity
 
where people think the value of equity
is what's not connecting in my head
 
is what's not connecting in my head
though is what you said earlier the gr
 
though is what you said earlier the gr
are 36% smaller than what they were in
 
are 36% smaller than what they were in
 
people are
 
people are
forfeiting exercising they're not
 
forfeiting exercising they're not
exercising and so those grants actually
 
exercising and so those grants actually
go back into the pool they do yes yeah I
 
go back into the pool they do yes yeah I
mean
 
mean
I think it's a hidden part of startups
 
I think it's a hidden part of startups
that people who don't exercise are a net
 
that people who don't exercise are a net
benefit to the company pool it's a weird
 
benefit to the company pool it's a weird
it's like a weird kind of awkward
 
it's like a weird kind of awkward
incentive where you know back in the day
 
incentive where you know back in the day
some Founders wouldn't even want their
 
some Founders wouldn't even want their
employees to know they had to exercise
 
employees to know they had to exercise
in 90 days because they were like hey if
 
in 90 days because they were like hey if
it returns to the pool more more to the
 
it returns to the pool more more to the
benefit of me and handing that Equity
 
benefit of me and handing that Equity
out again to the next employee but um in
 
out again to the next employee but um in
general I think I think the overriding
 
general I think I think the overriding
dynamic here is that it really gets back
 
dynamic here is that it really gets back
to the hiring numbers like yeah the the
 
to the hiring numbers like yeah the the
talent Market competitiveness dictates
 
talent Market competitiveness dictates
how lenient or generous a lot of these
 
how lenient or generous a lot of these
employment structures are so if there if
 
employment structures are so if there if
you could hire one of five great
 
you could hire one of five great
candidates and they all are looking for
 
candidates and they all are looking for
this job and they're willing all to take
 
this job and they're willing all to take
it like you're just not going to need to
 
it like you're just not going to need to
compete the same way you would if they
 
compete the same way you would if they
