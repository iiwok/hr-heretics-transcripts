all right everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we have an awesome guest
on the show we have Peter Walker joining
us from CA Peter is the head of insights
and they just put out a very interesting
report on the state of startup
compensation
for H2 of 2023 so we're going to get
into this thing Peter thanks so much for
joining us absolutely no yeah pleasure
to be here all right so we're g to get
right into it I keep hearing from VC's
that they're sitting on the most dry
powder ever and so I would just love for
you to talk to us about where did VC
Capital go in
 
historically noan what do you mean by
dry powder not everyone might know let's
start there noan yeah yeah so dry powder
is they raised a bunch of money from LPS
that is now still sitting generally in
like the LP's pocket because the capital
hasn't been called by VCS to then go put
into companies that's what dry powder
means yep y exactly so as you mentioned
VCS have committed or LPS have committed
a lot of money over you know the numbers
that you hear thrown around are 200
billion plus dollars to the VC asset
class but that money has yet to be
called to be put to work investing in
startups so what is this dry powder what
does this really mean for Founders and
how do we go through look if we just
compare the general gist of what
happened in 2023 it wasn't a good year
on Carta the collective carda companies
which is something like 40,000 startups
or so now in 2021 those companies raised
$220 billion in 2023 they raised 65
so that is a gigantic draw so VCS are
not deploying Capital at the same rate
that they were in the last two years
hands down for sure now what a lot of
Founders then say is well okay but
they've they've committed the LPS have
committed this Capital so certainly it's
going to get deployed at some point and
the points that I always make are two
things one that doesn't have to happen
on a timeline that's useful to the
founder the VCS can just not deploy it
for a long time much longer than the
company can generally stay vent and two
and more importantly a lot of that
capital is going to go to different
places rather than net new companies
it's going to be spent on Bridges and
extensions for current portfolio
companies it's going to go into
convertible notes and safes and it's
going to go do a work to keep companies
that these VCS already invested in alive
and that is a different thing than hey
we're going to invest into you know six
new series a companies this year so a
lot of that dry powder is never going to
really come into play for a lot of
founders
that's super interesting so now tell me
about the distribution so and what I'm
most interested in is early stage so
call it like seed series a grow stages
you know that b to Z Zone and then late
stages D and
Beyond what did it look like in 2023
compared to what you saw
historically so let's take 20 let's just
say 2019 as like the pre-bubble times is
 
in series a another call it 28 to 30% of
capital went to series D and Beyond so
that's 30 30 and then like a little bit
more into the midstage it was pretty
fairly equally split a third a third a
third in
 
went to early stage and only 14 went to
late stage so what does that mean that
means that there are way fewer late
stage rounds and many many fewer hundred
million plus rounds happening than there
used to be there's also fewer seed and
series a rounds happening but they just
did they held up relatively better so
the total mix shifted early but if
you're talking about again if the number
is what 200$ 250 billion dollars that
that amount of capital cannot be
invested into early stage startups there
are not enough early stage startups to
take that money in it's an investor
who's used to writing $15 million checks
is not suddenly just going to start
writing $2 million checks for all these
seed stage companies so a lot of that
dry powder again has to go to late stage
and late stage has not popped back up
yet yeah it's it also validates what I'm
hearing just from my friends in VC which
is there's a lot of alpha in the seed
and series a stage which basically means
like if I put in an early check uh it is
more likely to fail but the outcome on
it could be massive versus now the later
stage companies right now it doesn't
appear like they're perceive to have the
same amount of alpha like if I put in
$100 million into a series D like am I
going to like what's my opportunity to
get a 10x on that right so potentially
more early stage Investments with the
risk of losing some better than one big
investment yes but the problem is
there's just you know if you're just
going to say everyone invests in the
early stage that also isn't really a
solution for Venture as a whole you know
like not everyone can come down to the
early stage and it is why at some early
stages especially here in San Francisco
and Silicon Valley Broadley some of
these price Dynamics are wacky there's
enough competition at the early stage
that the valuations are actually pretty
high right now you would think they
would have come down a lot they really
didn't at least for seed rounds and
series a rounds they're they're close to
as high as they've ever been on a median
basis so so a lot of competition at the
early stage and then of course the the
question remains do companies grow
radically differently in this age of AI
than they used to will they need as much
late stage Capital like there's a lot of
Uncertain questions for late stage VC in
particular and question Peter I mean a
lot of these later stage companies
CDE they're kind of stuck yeah right now
like they should have been public two
years ago right they're they're kind of
waiting maybe they're thinking about
raising next year the year after because
of everything in the macro do you think
they're gonna have a harder time raising
how do you see that I do um some of them
are putting off raising because they can
some of them are putting off raising
because they're doing everything they
can to raise and no one wants to give
them more money right now but if you
look at the public markets multiples on
SAS companies if you just use that as a
as a proxy for the market as a whole
have come down a huge amount and we're
seeing historically low rates of IPOs
now maybe Reddit changes things that was
a that was that went off really well it
seems like so that's fantastic we need
some more momentum on the IPO Market to
really get back to health but there's
late stage companies who are taking
Bridge rounds taking down rounds they're
radically changing because everything
has radically changed around them if
they grew up in an era of low interest
rates maybe their business model doesn't
work as well in the hair of high
interest rates it's a it's a major shift
the way that we talk about it at card is
this is a wonderful time to start a
company it is a pretty difficult time to
grow one if you had already started in
that old old world that's really well
said let's talk about startup deaths so
the unfortunate reality is many startups
are shutting down right now I I just
want to hear like what does the data
look like like what are you guys seeing
with the c
data it's it's not pretty for sure 2023
was the worst year for startup shutdowns
on Carta uh since we were a company 2013
is when started so worst year and
unfortunately January 2024 was the worst
month so I'm not sure that it's going to
be the case that this slows down in 2024
now a lot of people want us to produce
what's called like a startup failure
rate what percent of startups went out
of business in any quarter or something
like that the difficulty with that is
it's really hard to get a stable
denominator for that rate because moris
are joining card all the time there's a
lot of start being created etc etc what
we can what I can tell you is 2023 was
the worst year for shutdowns for every
single cohort year of startups on Carta
so for instance if you were founded in
 
shut down 2023 if you were founded in
 
it was the worst year for startups of
all ages which tells me that it was just
a really difficult year for shutdowns a
lot of companies didn't make it through
the change from Old World to new world
that makes me sad like I feel sad it's
super sad and I don't like you know one
of the things that you hear when you
talk about startup shutdowns and
everything is well it two words come up
that I don't love one is tourist like oh
those were tourist Founders or they
didn't get into it for the right reasons
which is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I I hate that
and two is this is a return to health
and it's a good thing which I have to
say like might be true if you're looking
at this as a economic eem but it's not
these are people these Founders were to
do something great they were employing
people like let's be a little bit more
empathetic to how difficult a startup
shutdown can be on a buch people H
humans yes
totally so then the big question is if
 
seen for startup deaths on Carta what is
 
like my instinct is that it'll
be it again will be worse than 2023 what
I'm hoping is that it won't be that much
worse so the jump from 2022 to 2023 was
about two times um in terms of number of
startup shutdown 2023 to 2024 I'm hoping
for a reduction in the growth rates is
perhaps the best we can hope for
look the the the Crux of it is if
interest rates changed in early 2022 we
are now effectively two years on from
that period VCS in many cases probably
gave their portfolio companies a little
bit more leeway they were more willing
to do a bridge or an extension saying
look things changed on you we understand
that here's a little bit more cash like
hopefully you can make it to the next
round my instinct is that sort of
behavior won't be as available to people
in 2024 they'll look around and say look
you're just not going to make it like in
their mind throw good money after bad so
it's it's my gut is that there's going
to be fewer extensions fewer Bridges and
more shutdowns this year hey everyone
we'll be right back in a moment after a
word from our

and Kelly from HR heretic sent
[Music]
 
you so shutdown is one of the potential
outcomes the other potential outcome is
merger acquisition yep what is what does
the data look like for m&amp;a because the
story that Founders I think want to tell
themselves is like oh well you know we
won't be able to raise so like the next
thing we're going to do is sell the
company right and I I keep hearing
anecdotally the m&amp;a market is not what
people think it is our data backs up the
anecdote so it's not it's not impossible
right there are companies that are being
bought every day every quarter it's
probably about 150 companies a quarter
are purchased that that are acquired I
should say that are cter companies the
problem is that's basically flat from
where it was in 2022 and I don't see
maybe there'll be an m&amp;a boom this year
it's possible um the other point to make
to Founders who are thinking that is
that cannot you can't pivot from one
thing to another without having laid
some ground so if if you're looking for
a fundraising round and don't raise it
and you only have three months left in
this company's life before you run out
of money it's incredibly unlikely that
you'll be able to no Lage period one you
have no leverage and two you haven't
started the conversations yet these
things don't happen in a period of weeks
yeah and and I mean companies right they
get bought not sold I mean it's kind of
a i my double click on that Peter that's
that was my question is m&amp;a my double
click under that underneath that is
private Equity any data or point of view
on that that piece of the pie PE is
definitely one of the bigger buyers of
startups PE other startups big Tech
probably Encompass most of the purchases
of these these companies PE has been
again it's definitely it's not the
Roaring 20s like it's they're not
purchases happening all the time time
but it's kind of a steady looking at
things there are rollups happening Etc
um unfortunately I I think I think a lot
of companies are going to try to sell
themselves and are going to be
disappointed that's my instinct about
this coming year may be more startups
get acquired yes but the other thing is
unfortunately we don't have the ability
to tell whether or not an acquisition
was quote unquote quality so we we don't
know if that was hey you're just going
to basically Aqua hire some people and
nobody's going to make a lot of money or
if it was a real significant exit for a
lot of people on the cap table we really
can't see that so my gut is a lot of
Acquisitions that are happening are also
just Aqua hires or they're not actually
meaningfully impacting the the wealth of
the people that were in that company
beforehand yeah it's so interesting
because that ends up hurting the Venture
ecosystem right like if you're putting
Capital into the Venture ecosystem and
you're losing money as an investor yeah
and you're just less likely to do that
in the future the other piece is start
up hiring in the United States is a huge
driver of
employment in our country Y and so there
was some really interesting data as I
was going through the Carter report
around employment in startups can you
tell us what that data looks like
absolutely so again when we talk about
call it a universe of on the order of 40
to 45,000 startups on CA and you say
okay if we just look collectively across
those startups how many people do they
hire every year um in 2019 you know
fewer startups on Carta but they hired
about 280,000 people and about 125,000
people left either through layoff or
left by choice whatever they Departed
the company so that's a good ratio right
in 2021 and 2022 startups on Carta hired
half a million people basically 520,000
each year so wild growth like you know
startups were booming headcount was
growing across all these places good
time
 
to 260,000
hes cut in half so that was the hiring
market last year and then if you pair
that with the departures Market it was
more people left startups on Carta than
joined them in 2023 so the industry the
whole asset class got smaller in terms
of headcount last year that's the first
time that's happened ever in our data uh
you know we we didn't have a ton of data
on hiring and something back in 2013 but
in the last five six years that's the
first time that's happened ever yeah
yeah and a lot of those as we've seen
from the headlines a lot of those
departures were layoffs not departures
by choice so you know 2024 there is some
Rumblings that people are hiring again
do you have any early data on
 
January was GNA is going to be a decent
month for hiring uh the the the long and
short of it is like layoffs are down
from where they were peing in early 23
but they're not gone they haven't
subsided completely and it's uh my
instinct here is that a lot of startups
really took the shift and the advice
candidly from VCS to scrutinize
headcount very closely be incredibly
Capital efficient when it comes to your
growth they've taken that to heart and
so I would be reluctant to bet on a huge
hiring uptick this year I think it'll be
better than 2023 but maybe not
meaningfully better yeah and that that
scrutiny I mean it was it was more like
a mandate yeah like a suggestion uh and
I guess my my question underneath that
data Peter is I know it's all Tech but
is there any trends that you're seeing
in your data on type of Industry
geolocation anything like that right
right AI security tend to be more
healthy than others anything you can
offer on that front yeah I I think the
AI story holds up pretty well here you
know AI companies raised at higher rates
for higher valuations and probably hired
a few more people than other sectors
when we did this there's a heat map in
the report where we looked at the
various Industries and whether or not
they were growing so we just we did a
ratio of new hires to Dearing people so
if it's at one you're just flat new
hires in departures equal out more than
one you're growing less than one you're
shrinking the places that were still
growing as of the end of last year
energy startups Hardware startups
medical devices and biotech so like hard
tech deep Tech whatever you want to call
those they weren't robust growth rates
but they were still growing uh the
industries that were shrinking were SAS
fintech consumer adte edtech so like
course core
sassy um standard software startups is
that going to hold the rest of this year
I'm not sure but I I thought it was
interesting that the kind of the
industries that we're dealing with more
real world stuff were still growing if
if anemic that checks out with VC
Twitter about what VC Twitter is saying
which is I don't know if that's always
my favorite uh you you know reference
point but yes VC Twitter well yeah
you're the you're the source of the data
right but the the VC Twitter stuff that
I'm reading is hard tech is back that's
where investment is going versus SAS
software
is no longer as sexy as it once was and
the reason why is because the public
market multiples have been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
obliterated Bingo y it's I think it's
underrated the degree to which those
have shifted I mean there are whole
categories of things that VCS are no
longer really interested in I think the
easiest example there is things like DTC
retail you know if you look at what all
birds or some of the other startups are
now worth on the public markets like
there's not going to be a lot of VCS
back that sort of company anymore what
why would you when the public markets
aren't believing in them at all um so
the changes in public do filter down
into private it may take a little while
but those have real impacts on DC
decision making it's really interesting
for our audience because a lot of the
folks that Kelly and I talk to and a lot
of our listeners ask us like hey what
types of companies should I be looking
at yeah and I think if you're you know
either a prospective job Seeker today or
confidentially exploring new
opportunities what Peter just said is
what you need to listen to very acutely
which is hey like B2B sass direct to
Consumer those things are not getting
invested in right now and it doesn't
mean that that it's all bad businesses
but it does mean that when you look
underneath the hood those companies need
to either be profitable or have a path
to profitability because the reality of
them getting outside investment is quite
low in the new world that we're living
in I gotta be one C out there like B2B
SAS is still a huge category on carda
and I think it will continue to be a VC
vable category for sure yeah what's
really gone the Wayside is like food
apparel retail some more e-commerce e
startups like those have been far less
attractive to investors lately but to
your point about potential job Seekers a
lot of the best advice that we give and
have seen given to potential job Seekers
is to approach your next company as
though you were an investor so if you
were doing that what is their path to
profit Prof ability what is their path
if they're a seed or series a startup
how many how many series B and series C
startups are in that space is there
Capital being devoted to that place like
you can do some of this research on your
own and give you know if you're betting
on this new startup for your job you are
inherently betting on that equity and
that means you're making an investment
decision uh just like an adviser would
it's so important too because before
this macro turned you know the last
eight years money grew on trees like no
one cared it was like yes I'll take it
yes I'll take it yes I'll take the level
of business Acumen jump that I think all
these folks need to make now is pretty
drastic and some of these questions you
just mentioned Peter noan HR people
don't even know how to ask them half AG
I don't know if there's place to learn
this stuff but you're so right and I
don't think that candidates or HR people
have been approaching these things as an
investor for a long time it's such a
good frame Peter I love the frame of a
candidate should evaluate a company in
this the same way an investor would yeah
I think one of the discrepancies with
that model is investors kind of care
about the last price but they're going
to come in and set a new price sure sure
and so I I get a lot of friends who are
who are interviewing at larger pre-ipo
tech
companies whose valuations were set in
 
reset yep and like the reality unless
they're growing into it which very few
companies are yeah most companies are if
they are going to survive are taking
down rounds I mean even the best
companies like I know ramp took it down
round like are doing this yep and so
what's your advice to job Seekers that
are talking to companies that raised at
Peak but haven't reset the
valuation I mean this is the this is the
sort of Catch 22 with today's job market
because I have a lot of advice that I
could give to candidates about how you
need to approach these conversations the
sort of data that you want from these
companies but I'm cognizant of the fact
that in many cases this is going to be
your only offer and it's difficult to
really feel like you have the capacity
to push in those
conversations when perhaps this is the
only job opportunity you have on on hand
at the moment and you you really want a
job like I want to so that upfront like
caveat these are tough conversations to
have sometimes as a candidate that said
if a company is only giving you their
valuation after the last round of
funding and it's been three years heads
up like like the market has completely
shifted it may not be worth that much uh
the the number one thing and this is
less common at the very late stage Tech
but if they are giving you just a simple
number of shares that is not enough
information you have no idea how those
shares work you need at least at the
very least you need the number of shares
you get and the total outstanding
dilution or share count for the company
so you can have an of the percentage
ownership percentage ownership is the
thing that you want the other thing no
and you and I have gone back and forth
on this a little bit you can talk about
investing schedules you can talk about
post termination exercise periods
there's a lot of ins and outs with the
grants one thing I'm honestly not sure
if a lot of HR folks can answer but I
love candidates who can push on this the
question I always tell candidates to ask
is if or when this company goes public
or gets acquired has an exit of some
kind what is the minimum price per share
it needs to achieve
for people with common stock to make a
profit what that means is you do not
care whether or not the investors make a
profit oftentimes investor shares have
preference they're called preferred
shares and they may make a profit such
to such a degree that the common shares
what the founder and the employees hold
Come Away with nothing so just getting
an idea of what the company's valued at
now doesn't tell you anything about the
liquidation preferences in that cap
table all sorts of stuff so I I love
that question about what do common what
does common stock need to make a profit
because it gets at the real Crux of the
argument there how much can That Vary
Peter like I mean it can be the answer
to that question look in a lot of
companies it's not actually that
variable in some companies it could be a
 
preferen is basically for everyone
listening a 1x liquidation preference
which is very common across Venture
means hey on an exit the investors get
paid back first whatever they invested
and then the rest of it is shared
amongst all shares as common stock a 2X
liquidation preference means the
investor gets their money back and then
again one once more their money back and
then everybody else shares in it so if
you have an exit for $500 million and
your company had $200 million invested
and that investor had a 2X liquidation
preference guess what you're only going
to be sharing a 100 million out of that
 
so it can be a really big deal oh my God
I just stop I have never asked that I've
asked every question you can think of
around Equity I have never asked that
question did you Nolan did you ask that
question at CA so I'll tell you a story
um when I was at door Dash it was really
brutal raising our series C and when we
raised it uh I'll never forget this is
like you know Tony came out and you know
introduced the round I think it was like
 
that's how we announced it to the
company
Tech crunch then ran a story the next
day and said that there was a 3X
liquidation preference and then they
described it I had I had no idea what
this meant at the time they described it
which is exactly what Peter said which
is investors would make 3x it basically
had to hit a certain price for that
liquidation preference to go away they
would make 3x their money before Common
got paid out and the way I found that
out was a candidate saw the story on
Tech Crunch and asked me about it and
then I had to go ask Tony about it and
what it meant and look to put myself in
Tony's shoes most people don't
understand
this and so you know I I think as a as a
Founder you're less likely to just
proactively bring this up because it
only causes more questions and confusion
for people who already don't understand
how this works but this is structure
like there and and I think Peter the
next question I want to ask you
is it I've been anecdotally hearing
again that more structure is showing up
in term sheets and so what are you
seeing is there data that backs that up
 
one of many different terms it can be
higher liquidation preference cumulative
dividends participating preferred shares
there's a lot of different ins and outs
with Venture structure but if we just
take liquidation preferences as like a
starting point it on Carta early stage
deal seed in series a only about 3% of
them have a high liquidation preference
so very few that's great and that hasn't
really risen much too it hasn't really
risen too much in later years so early
stage pretty immune to this growth stage
series B and series C 2019 5% had high
liquidation preference 2023 9% du is
that every deal no definitely not but a
big jump late stage it went from like
seven or eight% to 177% in 2023 so like
wow these jumps matter now a lot of
investors will say look if the company
IPOs or does pretty well like a lot of
these liquidation preferences will come
out in the wash and that's true but it
still it still Paints the picture of an
information asymmetry on behalf of
everyone who isn't an employee in this
company so like the overall point is if
you're a Founder listening on this call
I I get what Nolan said there like it's
difficult to try to explain a highly
complex liquidation preference to every
one of your employees at a town hall
maybe that's not the right venue but
being forthcoming with how investment
affects their potential on their Equity
I think is really important and it it
just is less there's less education
there's less focus on it and you know in
a market like this it's incredibly
crucial to do and I I will add it will
come at some point right let's just
pretend nothing three years later the
company goes IPO all these people join
thinking they're going to make a million
plus dollars and then you tell them oh
just kidding you're making nothing or
very nominal amounts I mean it will come
out at some point unless of course
nothing happens with the company but
it's just so important Peter where can
people go what's the one or two places
that you would send people to get smart
about this I'll I'll speak our own book
here for a second I think that we have
some of if not the best educational
content on equity in the world it's very
easy to find if you go to carter.com
equity there are courses from
celebrities there are like deep Dives
with CA employees about taxes there's
anything and everything the other offer
that I'll make here which is a new thing
that we we just got off the ground which
I'm pretty proud of is if you are a
candidate for a startup job so that's
anything from basically series a onward
uh you can go to
carter.com give us a little information
about the position that you're applying
for and we will give you what we give
companies a and salary and Equity we
will give you the ranges so you can walk
into that negotiation knowing basically
exactly what your recruiter is looking
at it's just going back to the
liquidation preference conversation and
I'm stunned by how big of jumps that is
yeah and Kelly you had mentioned like
You' never asked that before part of the
reason
you didn't ask it is because you didn't
have
to and now it's showing up I mean in
almost 20% of late stage companies like
one in five late stage companies that is
insane and so to the point around
Founders communicating this or chief
people officers or CFOs communicating
this you have a choice which is one try
and tuck it under the rug and hope
people don't see it but what you're
doing there is you're kicking the can
down the road and to Kelly's point
people are going to find out and it's
likely going to be at the worst possible
moment that they find out and then
you're going to be behind it and people
are going to be pissed versus the other
option is you could get out in front of
it communicate about it now take the tax
of helping people understand what it
actually means and why you're still
bullish why you took the terms of the
deal and that way people can vote with
their feet today and I I think when you
say it like that it seems like an
obvious choice but it does feel easier
when you're just talking with people who
only understand bespoke VC terms to just
like let's just not bring this up
because you know if the company is
successful it's not going to matter
that's an easy story to tell when
reality is is you're losing trust along
the way the sting The Sting of the
timing of that information can be quite
severe there is some silver lining data
that we have showing that Founders
really do care about their employees in
many cases employees ownership and
making sure that they're incentivized
long term so a lot of down rounds are
happening that's you know when a startup
is valued at say a billion and then they
take the next round and that next round
values them at 700 million that's a Down
Round what happens sometimes in those
rounds is the actual fair market value
the foreigna assigned price of the
options for each employee is actually
lower than whatever the employee got
when they received the shares so they're
actually underwater on their options
companies and Boards can do what's
called a repricing where they actually
retire that old equity and reissue it to
those employees at the new lower price
so that they have more upside in the
equity and we saw more companies do that
over the last year than we've ever seen
at mostly late stage mostly pretty
Advanced companies but it was good it
was heartening to see like look there's
no requirement that they reissue this
Equity but a lot of companies did take
the position hey we really care about
our employees and we wanted to see that
Equity repriced so yeah there's are
there are a lot I don't want to paint
all these Founders as like Bad actors
there's a ton of Founders who deeply
care about this
but the education piece can get really
tricky yeah for sure I love that I was
going to ask about that we were talking
with some friends last week Nolan and I
about this and I guess a followup in
addition to that Peter is are you seeing
companies late stage that have gone from
options to rsus like we did two years
ago go back to options and why would
they do that interesting we haven't seen
a a return to options from rsus really
quickly the difference between an option
and an RSU basically boils down to if
you are receiving incentive stock
options which is the majority of startup
employees they are going to have two
criteria in order to become real stock
one they need to be vested and that's
usually you know four years with a
one-year Cliff the standard vesting
schedule and two they need to be
exercised so you will need to pay out of
pocket some exercise cost to sort of
take possession of those options rsus
basically remove that second option from
they are automatically exercised when
they vest so that's useful in late stage
companies because it locks in a price
for the employee but it can be tough if
you have to pay taxes on something that
is maybe not going to be worth all that
much in the end or and pay the exercise
cost or not currently liquid it's not
liquid liquidated right now like you
can't access liquidity today with that
 
to our or move back to options once you
started the RSU path but rsus are also
for late stage only really you don't
really touch rsus until you're I don't
know I don't know what the marker might
be 700 million a billion dollars in
valuation something like that so it
doesn't really apply to the earliest
companies yeah um I had I was thinking
when we were talking about the jumps in
the multiple
 
follow that bouncing ball if we'll see
Talent maybe more at the leadership
level choosing earlier stage companies
versus the later stage companies right
I'm just thinking like would I choose a
series e with a 3X or would I choose the
early series B with a one I wonder if
that will have a lagging impact on where
the best talent is choosing to go in the
next 18 months that's a really
interesting question I'm not sure we
have the data to answer that yet we do
have a lot of information on salary and
Equity trends for for employees both you
know VP exec and and then down to the
entry level generally
speaking
hiring I think for everyone thinking
about their next move like it is true
that the executive Market is just
functions a bit differently than the
rest of the startup market for one thing
it's more National so you're not really
going to pay that VP of engineering that
much less if they're in Boise than San
Francisco the way that you might get a
pretty solid cost Arbitrage if they're
an entry-level engineer so that's one
difference and then two
yeah the equity functions a bit
differently there are sometimes
management carve outs like it can get a
little tricky it's a great question
Kelly and I think it changes the
calculus of risk right because
theoretically as a company gets later
stage they get less risky yeah and so
the story you tell yourself is I will
have an exit here like the opportunity
for me to have a true uh liquidation
event is higher but if there is
preference liquidation preferences
involved the calculus on that changes
right so I think tot I think you're on
to something so while while we're on the
thread of startup
compensation tell us what you're seeing
in the data with salary
Trends yeah so salary's actually been
interesting in that not much has
happened which perhaps doesn't sound
interesting at the surface but if you
think about all the macro changes that
have happened to startups over the last
couple years it was a bit surprising to
see that salaries are if you just
compare say November 2022 to January
 
that period maybe like a tiny bit up not
keeping Pace with inflation by any means
but also not they haven't declined very
much and that's the salary Benchmark
that we would suggest for a new the
average new employee joining a company
so in that way I think that's kind of at
least a decent signal for candidates
like the salaries are still pretty
strong but they certainly haven't kept
pace with inflation which many
candidates are surprised by what about
Equity yeah so that's where the the
bombshell really drops if you look again
that November 2022 to January 2024 the
average Equity package granted to a new
employee at a startup is down
 
wild and to be clear this isn't because
the company is worthless that's a
separate Dynamic we're talking about
right literally you as if no if I joined
in November 22 and Nolan joined in
January 2024 and we joined at the same
level in the same position at this
startup Nolan would get 36% less Equity
than I did which is wild do we know why
do we know are shareholders just
protecting more like what's the there's
a couple of reasons why you know this is
a little bit of guessing but educated
guessing on our part from Carta so in
the report we proferred a couple reasons
why this might be so first and foremost
Equity option pools for employees
typically expand as fundraising happens
so a lot of companies have not had the
opportunity to expand those option pools
at all because they haven't fundraised
in a long time so they're having to make
each individual sliver of that pool last
longer so that's one two this gets into
the hiring Market you know if in 2021
you wanted to hire this engineer and
they had five offers you were far more
likely to go above your benchmarks for
that Equity than you were today if that
engineer has no other offers so the top
end of the equity Benchmark has kind of
been eliminated at a lot of these
because the competitive or the the
talent Market has just shifted towards
employers so those are two reasons I'm
sure that there like the General Air of
be cash conservative watch your burn
also applies to equity um so a lot of
that is happening so it's it's been a
major change yeah makes total sense the
most interesting part about that data is
that if it's if Equity compensation is
down from
 
that hasn't repriced its
valuation like it's almost doubly down
yep because the market valuation is no
longer tied to the actual Market where
it is today Y and now you're getting
less equity on top of it so at some
point a new Mark is going to come in
that's likely lower than where the
valuation is today and your Equity is
already you said 36% lower yep damn I
need some more silver linings we can't
we can't end we can't end like this I
don't want to end I don't want to end
okay one more one more like uh bad part
of this uh shitty cake before we get to
like frosting on the top of it um so uh
one thing to note here is that employees
are no dummies they have internalize
this Dynamic and so when it comes up to
that period where you want to exercise
your options employees are saying thanks
but no thanks only about
 
before they expire right now and so why
would it why would an option expire wow
maybe you were there for 10 years but
more likely it's because you're leaving
so if you think about it you usually
have that 90-day window to exercise so
another another shitty cake that 90day
window no we could talk I could talk
your ear off about how much the post-
termination exercise window is is
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so if you just think about it
in that 90day period only like three and
four basically employees are letting
their Equity go they're just saying
thanks it's not worth the exercise cost
I appreciate being here for two or three
years but I'm going to walk away with no
upside in this company which makes
especially if you think about a lot of
those people are faced with that
decision after they get laid off so if
you get laid off I'm going to give this
company a little bit more cash to
exercise his Equity no way and so that's
another like negative bearish signal on
where people think the value of equity
is what's not connecting in my head
though is what you said earlier the gr
are 36% smaller than what they were in
 
people are
forfeiting exercising they're not
exercising and so those grants actually
go back into the pool they do yes yeah I
mean
I think it's a hidden part of startups
that people who don't exercise are a net
benefit to the company pool it's a weird
it's like a weird kind of awkward
incentive where you know back in the day
some Founders wouldn't even want their
employees to know they had to exercise
in 90 days because they were like hey if
it returns to the pool more more to the
benefit of me and handing that Equity
out again to the next employee but um in
general I think I think the overriding
dynamic here is that it really gets back
to the hiring numbers like yeah the the
talent Market competitiveness dictates
how lenient or generous a lot of these
employment structures are so if there if
you could hire one of five great
candidates and they all are looking for
this job and they're willing all to take
it like you're just not going to need to
compete the same way you would if they
all had four other job offers makes
total sense Peter Walker I promise next
time we'll end on a higher note um I was
actually rocking my brains I'm like what
is a good sign
that we can talk about here this is the
we'll wait for one and when there's a
good sign we'll have you back on yeah so
I was just going to say Peter we we have
to have you back when you guys put out
the next report because this level of
breakdown gets to a a level of
granularity that everyone wants to
better understand and informs people on
how they make career choices yeah so we
can't thank you enough for the time we
are absolutely going to drag you back on
the show in the next couple of months
and thank you so much yeah thank you
I'll come I'll come Kicking and
Screaming no problem guys all right HR
