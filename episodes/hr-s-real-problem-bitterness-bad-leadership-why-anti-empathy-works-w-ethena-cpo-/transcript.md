Hey everybody. A few weeks ago, we
started bringing back some Essential
Heretics 101 content. for today.
Athena's CPO challenges empathydriven
management, exposes toxic executive
dynamics, and advocates for logic over
emotion in workplace leadership. Hey
everybody, welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast. Today we're talking to
Melanie Nanho, which I'm so excited
about.
&gt;&gt; Melanie, thanks for joining HR Heretics.
We're so happy to have you.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. I'm really excited
to be chatting with you two today.
&gt;&gt; So happy.
&gt;&gt; Hell yeah. So, I actually want to get
into Athena first. So, it's interesting
that you are an HR person at an HR
company. Tell us a little bit about
Athena and how you met Roxanne and that
whole story, please.
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
which uh let's just put it out there.
That sounds pretty boring if you think
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
prevention training, not very exciting,
right? But what I think is more
interesting is two things. One is the
truth is that when I joined Athena
Roxan, who's my CEO and and my manager,
she really did think that HR was just
payroll and benefits. And for the
record, she's been open about this and
she has since changed her mind. But
what's fascinating to me on that front
is that we are literally an HR tech
company. And even within an HR tech
company who is selling to HR buyers,
this is a misunderstanding. This is an
actual problem. Um and so you know
luckily Roxanne had lots of humility
asked lots of questions she has since
changed her mind we work so closely
together. The second thing reason why I
think it's so fascinating is because now
now that we are past that right now that
we are you know in sync we chat we
really see each other as um thought
leaders and partners and all of that
stuff. um the amount of impact that I've
been able to have from the HR
perspective given that I literally am
the person that we are selling to has
been just huge. And I have to say um for
anyone who's unhappy at their current
job and is looking for a better way. I
think working for an HR tech company
that gets the HR business case, it just
takes such a load off your your plate
when you don't have to constantly fight
to prove the value of HR.
Melanie, given that you have spent a lot
of time, I'm assuming spent a lot of
time with Athena's buyer, tell us like
what are your general learnings of HR
leaders and what are your takeaways?
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's such a great question because
I think there are so many different uh
categories of HR leaders. Um, you've got
people who are firsttime HR leaders.
Maybe they've been thrown into it
unwillingly. So, I see this quite often.
um you you join as a recruiter for a
startup and suddenly you're the head of
HR, but you've never done anything in
the HR space and now you need to
advocate for HR things. You're
responsible for hiring a compliance
provider or you don't even know what the
compliance laws are. And then there's a
leader who's, you know, they've been in
the game for a while. They've been here
maybe 10, 15, 20 years, but you know,
maybe they're sick of doing all the
admin stuff. They don't want to be
thinking about your compliance or your
another performance review. They're sort
of like past that already. My take on it
is that honestly I think that we are all
super disconnected and we're not talking
to each other. I think there's a lot of
a sense of isolation. I think there's a
lot of um a lot of bitterness happening
and I have all the empathy in the world
that I just I think that our jobs keep
getting harder and harder and we don't
have an outlet to talk about some of the
things that we're struggling with. I
also think that sometimes because we are
so siloed, because we are so desperate,
we sort of get in this cycle of
autopilot and dwelling in what's not
working versus, hey, this isn't working.
Let's do something different. Hey, I'm
really frustrated about this. Do you
know what? I'm tired of venting. I'm
going to actually do something about it.
I think we're in this really tough spot
right now where people are really
struggling to sort of pull themselves
out of that that dark place.
&gt;&gt; Why do you think that is? You mentioned
bitterness. I absolutely notice this as
as it's kind of like a big theme right
now in my from my perspective in the HR
community. Why do you think that is?
&gt;&gt; And I and I'd love to know what does it
look like, Melanie? Like what does it
look and feel like? What does that mean?
&gt;&gt; So I think what it looks like is to be
honest, I don't think that you always
get the best of us. I think that
sometimes we are halfassing it.
Sometimes we are just doing the bare
minimum to get by because we are so
burnt out. We are so exhausted. And you
know what? The last time I put my heart
and soul into a project, it got vetoed
or I got buy in to do it. I spent three
months working on it and then at the
last minute I got all this push back and
never mind, it's not going to happen. Go
do something else. Right? And so again,
like I I always approach with empathy. I
don't think anyone's doing it
intentionally, but I think
understandably after months, years of
this kind of response, it ends up
looking like I'm just not going to give
you my all anymore because I I
physically mentally cannot anymore. I
think we have to take a step back to
really understand the full context here,
which is this is my opinion, okay? I
think HR is a really unique industry in
that or or field in that up until I want
to say the last few years I don't think
most people sort of grew up dreaming of
being in HR. I think HR was a field and
a function that people sort of fell into
either because they couldn't find
something else, they weren't sure what
else they wanted to do. Somebody saw
some empathy in them and they were like
clearly you must be in HR. And for the
record, I put myself in this bucket. I
didn't dream of being in HR. Um, and so
I think you bring together a bunch of
people who might ne necessarily have
been passionate about this thing. Then
on top of that, you don't really empower
them. So you say, "Hey, you got a bunch
of responsibility, but no authority."
Your your authority comes with the power
to influence. That's your authority. And
so then they bring things to you, they
don't do it in the right way. Say, for
example, they just don't have business
savvy. So they think that an effective
business case is because the employees
would really like it. I just I got the
vibe. They're really upset. and I think
this would make them happy. And then
what happens? The CEO dismisses them
because they're not speaking the CEO's
language. They're using terms like
happiness. They're using terms like it
feels like the right thing to do. Of
course, they're being dismissed, right?
But no one takes the time to give them
that feedback explicitly and say, "Hey,
let me explain to you why your case was
significantly less compelling than the
case that our head of sales just brought
to me." Nobody does that. So, we just
get in this cycle of feeling
disempowered, um, not not getting ahead,
no one giving us the feedback on how to
get better, and eventually,
understandably, we just assume, well,
either I suck or they just don't get me,
so I'm going to give up.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Dosha who leads talent at Signal Fire
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metiv is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver. Because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metivview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metav. Head over to metave.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
Generally speaking, you'd assume those
of us in HR, heads of people have high
EQ, right? We have good intuition. We
empathize.
And it's also one of those roles where
you can't just go do stuff, right? Like
I I was hanging out with a sales person.
Just go do it. I got this. And they just
kind of like paint and they go and we we
have to be a lot more methodical. You
have to win hearts and minds. You have
to influence people. And that takes a
big toll. I mean, it's a different
weight of of stuff here. And you're
right, when it keeps getting shut down
down, down, down, and you have high EQ.
I mean, you're kind of like, why am I
going to keep running my head against
the wall that that that phenomenon, I
think, is very real.
&gt;&gt; I actually have a pretty strong opinion
on something you just said in terms of
the the EQ side of things. Yes, of
course, EQ is very important. We need to
have it, right? It's a muscle you learn
if you don't have it naturally. And
also, I actually had a manager who for
years just just just really explicitly,
blatantly, consistently shamed me for
not being emotional enough. Melanie, you
need more empathy. Melanie, this person
said this thing and I didn't see a
single emotion cross your face. And she
just really drilled into me that this
was a bad thing for HR. You need to have
emotions. You need to really care about
happiness. You all these things. And I
have to say, I have to say I actually
have found that to be an incredible
weakness for people in the HR field. I
think that the greatest value you can
bring when dealing with high emotion
situations is actually being able to set
your own emotions aside for a second and
look at things really neutrally. I think
that uh high functioning HR people
actually don't lead with their emotions.
They lead with logic. They lead with um
you know with data, statistics. I
actually think it's just wrong when
people are sort of like, "Oh, you're an
emotional person. You like empathize a
ton. You would be great in HR."
Actually, I don't know that you would be
great in HR because there are going to
be a lot of high stress emotional
situations and you might end up taking
sides. You might not be able to handle
it.
&gt;&gt; That is so well said, Melanie. It's not
about it's I think it's actually about
emotional regulation
&gt;&gt; and also using logic to solve problems
because typically when emotion is
involved stakes are high and problem is
probably really big and and so in order
to solve that problem having emotional
maturity to stay in control of those
emotions to deescalate folks and then to
switch the the mode in our brain. I I I
totally agree with you, but I don't see
like the HR community pushing for what
you just said and I'm I'm left wondering
like why that is the case and why your
opinion is not more widely shared.
&gt;&gt; That's a great question. I mean, do you
know what? I'll answer it, but I'm
curious to hear what you two think
actually.
&gt;&gt; Well, and I had a question on community
because I feel like every time I look
up, there's still a lot of silos. So I'm
also wondering like what what is the nut
to crack here?
&gt;&gt; I think that there is a monoculture in
HR that is accepted and then anything
outside of that monoculture that doesn't
appeal to HR safety is the way I would
describe it. So making HR leaders feel
safe with their venting
is it's thought of as like well you're
on the outside and you're not here to
help us. That's my personal belief and
what I've experienced.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Spicy. I love it. Okay,
Kelly, that's
&gt;&gt; why we're here. That's why we're here. I
think a lot of people, to your point,
fell into HR, right? And to me,
following that thread logically, if you
fall into something, that means you
haven't really thought about it a ton.
Maybe you don't have a super strong
point of view on what it is. And so, the
expectations of others imprint on you
and you become that thing. Like, I've
seen HR people get rattled. like an
employee is like you are this, you
should be this, you should be a
therapist, you should be right, we
talked about knitting HR sweaters last
episode, like you should be the mother
hen and that's the job.
&gt;&gt; I don't think that there's a whole lot
of formal education around the concept
of HR. I think to your point, Kelly,
people get thrown in, right? And it's
sort of like figure it out and I don't
want to hear about this. Just make the
problem go away. There's no intentional
let's think about what an effective HR
philosophy looks like. I think my
spicier take which I always try to be
really careful in my wording here
because I think it could land poorly and
be received incorrectly is I think that
there is a gendered element to this and
what I mean by that is if you look at
the demographic of the HR function the
majority of us identify as women um many
of us identify as women of color if you
look around a room of executives right
there might oftenimes just be one woman
in that executive room and it's the head
of char right and I think often times
what can happen is if someone is not
presenting something in a way that lands
they just dismiss the person right
instead of having a real intentional
conversation about it there is very much
a gender dynamic when you are the only
woman in a senior room and you say
something and everyone just looks at you
like that was a dumb idea but no one
explains why right so I think that we do
need to think about power dynamics of
all kinds when we're talking about HR
and in relation to any other uh
department and and the overall executive
team.
&gt;&gt; It's also this like cabal thing that
happens and I I call it like do you all
have conversations above the table or do
you have them under after like in diad
or triad chats or texts? Like is is it
all above board or is it this weird
thing where like something happens like
people kind of ignore Melanie in a
meeting and then like two other you know
insecure executive team members get win
that maybe Melanie's on the outs so uh
like this it's real and it's immature
and these are executives and these are
adults but I'm telling you the
insecurities
sometimes the greed sometimes the ego I
don't know like the cocktail changes
company to company, but I've seen it.
It's very dysfunctional. And that was
like
honestly my main um filter. I would I
would talk to founder CEOs or vet out
new opportunities around this dynamic
that you can't really measure and you
can barely touch it and feel it, but
it's a tsunami when it happens and it's
brutal.
&gt;&gt; Couldn't agree more. I firmly believe
that people will fill in the gaps. And I
think it's just human nature, right?
We're trying to make sense of things. We
want to understand things. And so if
something is unspoken, we will fill it
in with our own assumptions. If I
present something and nobody comments or
or people just say like some positive
stuff but they don't have any real
conversations, I'm going to fill in the
gaps with okay, either they don't trust
that I can take the feedback or they
weren't even listening or they, you
know, they've all decided that I'm
already bad at my job. And so in the
absence of communication, all these
horrible misunderstandings and
assumptions get made. I think that so
many leadership teams are so entrenched
in politics and working against each
other instead of with each other that
one I don't think most people want to
ask for their fellow exec's opinion
because they personally don't even care
for it. They're like, "You're wrong. I
already don't like you. I I think you're
bad at your job. You were passive
aggressive in that last meeting. Your
opinion quite frankly doesn't matter to
me." And second, I think tied into those
politics, right? No, no, no, no, no.
This is leverage you're going to use
against me. I don't want to be
vulnerable with you right now. on
presenting, you know, a tough front. I
think there are actually some some
deeper issues that most leadership teams
would probably need to work through
before they even got to the point of
being comfortable asking a question. And
I think it's it's beyond ego in my
opinion. At those companies, there's
someone who's pushing that agenda. Do
you know what I mean? Like that happens
because a CEO is rewarding, right?
&gt;&gt; You took the words right out of my
mouth. Like it it always stems from
that, right? Are you allowing this to
happen? Are you exacerbating it? Are you
biased in some exact members versus
others? Or and I will give Tuttlesen,
Pendo CEO, a ton of credit here.
The guy doesn't care where you came
from, if you've been there eight years,
a month, if you go to dinner and drinks,
if you don't, he he literally I don't
know if it's just a chip in his head is
not there. He doesn't play into this.
And I think it's phenomenal. I mean, it
literally has created an atmosphere
where you know that if you politic all
damn day long, you're still not going to
get leverage because the guy just sees
everyone. It's great. Um, and how do we
create more of that, right? And if you
don't have that microchip or not have it
in his case, I don't know which one. How
are you leaning on your HR leader,
someone that you trust to call your
stuff out and make sure that it's
healthy? Because once that room becomes
unhealthy, it all flows down from there.
That's exactly the question I was going
to ask, which is when you don't have
somebody like Todd who's the CEO, I
think what you're describing, Kelly, by
the way, is an idea meritocracy,
like to where it's just about the ideas
and the merit of those ideas versus
where they come from or who said it when
you don't have a Todd as your CEO, then
how do you solve that problem? In my
mind, it's basically just like you have
to try and terminate the person who's
causing the toxicity or leave. Am I
missing something in that logic?
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't actually think it's just
about being a meritocracy. I think it's
about having a clear and aligned vision.
I think most companies there's a
tendency to favor one department over
another. So, the sales team is the most
important or the engineering team is the
most important, right? And and I think
that then stirs up these issues, right?
as opposed to no no we are a united team
and we have a company goal. How is any
idea that we are presenting ultimately
helping the company? I I think uh where
it needs to start is do we are we as a
company aligned on what our singular
goal is and how it is that we get there
and then any idea that gets brought to
the table needs to needs to ultimately
feed into that goal not not be pitting
us against each other.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. and and you know sometimes
not but usually right if you ask that
founder CEO like what is this well
they're not good they're not performing
well that that's fine and that very well
may be true but that's a different
conversation and a different how than
what might be going on with this
phenomenon that we're talking about of
either ignoring them or avoiding them
right and it's just not it's just not a
good way of doing business because what
does that do it actually impacts the
business
&gt;&gt; I will say when there's the performance
issue it is important that you act
really quickly as quickly as possible
and as transparently and directly as
possible. Uh at Athena we have so we
have these three questions that we have
all managers ask themselves of their
teams every I don't know like let's say
once a quarter periodically but the idea
is they know these in the back of their
mind all the time. Um it's is this
person ultimately making my job easier
or harder? If I could go back in time
knowing what I know today would I hire
them again? And if they were to quit
today, how would I feel? Panicked,
relieved, neutral. And the idea of that
is to remove that emotional element. Cuz
often times if you ask someone, is
someone a high performer? That you get
all these like hemming and hawing like,
well, this they're really good at this,
but you know, they're really nice and
well, they they're good for morale. It's
like, no, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't
hire them for morale. I hired them to
get the job done. So tell me ultimately,
are they getting their job done?
&gt;&gt; Do you guys do pips? Do you guys believe
in pips or or do you try and avoid the
pip process entirely?
&gt;&gt; This is such I find that this tends to
be so controversial. People feel really
strongly about this. We don't do pips.
We don't do pips. And I think personally
my opinion is that most people do pips
for liability reasons. They just want to
have a thing kind of documented, right?
But I think that pips oftentimes can
just be an excuse for I haven't been
giving you feedback for a really long
time. So now retroactively, I'm going to
put it all out there. Um, I also think
pips are incredibly demoralizing. It's
sort of like, hey, for the record, in
like 30 days, we're probably going to
fire you, but um, you know, here's what
you can try to do and maybe keep your I
just don't find that to be an effective
way to do anything other than to manage.
&gt;&gt; It's totally ca.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 100. In which case, you might as
well just say, listen, you've got two
options. You can try or you can take a
separation package. Which one do you
want? I don't see why we have to sort of
play this song and dance around like,
you know, let's pretend that we actually
believe in this. Um, we don't do that at
Athena. We're pretty direct. We we have
regular feedback discussions, but when
someone's job is on the line, um, our
managers are explicitly required to say,
"You are not meeting expectations." And
after a couple of weeks, if things still
haven't improved, they will say they're
required to say, "Listen, your job is
currently at risk. And if I don't see
improvement in the next few weeks, the
reality is we're going to be having a
different conversation about whether or
not you can continue to stay employed at
the company. And we do this again for
full transparency for so that the person
actually has a chance to turn things
around to ask questions. Maybe there's
an underlying issue that they haven't
spoken up about and I can help. But but
no, we don't do pips. We just do
really candid feedback and then, you
know, eventually we make a tough
decision if necessary or people turn
things around. And for the record,
sometimes people turn things around.
&gt;&gt; Feedback is just, it's amazing how easy
it is when you're just direct, but also
just talking to the person like a human,
right? Direct, but equal. Hey, like what
do you think? I I'm concerned. This
isn't working. What do you want to do?
Versus
you are missing you. I mean, it's just
that sometimes the approach and the tone
is most of it. It's not actually the
feedback or the outcome.
&gt;&gt; Totally. And I will say most people kind
of suck at feedback. They just don't
know how to go into specifics. They lead
with emotions. It's very vague. You
know, it's again going back to my
manager, you're just not empathetic
enough. What What does that mean? And
how is that tied into the business?
How's that part of my job? You know, I
think most people just they are not
specific enough and so then
understandably that person can't even
receive the feedback.
&gt;&gt; Melanie, this was incredible. Thank you
so much for sharing your learnings with
us. Before we let you go, do you have
any advice for people leaders?
 
My recommendation would be twofold. One,
find your space for release. I think
there's a lot of pentup stress and
bitterness. I think find your place for
release, whether that's your own people
community, whether that's at home with
your friends. And then two,
put aside the emotion and focus on the
solution in a really logical way. If
your, you know, if your leadership team
has been, you know, shooting down all
your initiatives, instead of saying, "Oh
my gosh, why do they never listen to my
initiatives?" Why not just say, "Hey, I
haven't been able to convince you in the
past three times that I've rolled out an
initiative, be straight with me. Why
not? What would have made it better? How
could I have won you over?" Instead of
getting up in our heads and sort of uh
wallowing in what's not working, and
again, I have empathy. I understand why
it happens. Realizing that that's not
going to solve the problem, pause and
have a real conversation. So well said
Melanie. Thank you so much for spending
the time.
&gt;&gt; Thank you Nolan.
