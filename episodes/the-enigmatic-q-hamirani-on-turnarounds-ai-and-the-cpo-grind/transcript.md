# The Enigmatic Q Hamirani on Turnarounds, AI, and the CPO Grind

## Transcript

 
sometimes you don't balance it and you
just kill yourself I mean when I had to
lead the layoffs at Airbnb or even The
Nomad program that we came up you know I
there was a period where I slept for 40
minutes a night for a week and probably
a couple hours for the weeks before that
and that was not bit- sizing it but we
didn't have a choice we couldn't
bite-size some something as big as that
so sometimes you can try to bite-size it
sometimes you don't you just get through
it and for me My Philosophy is a little
bit of um the harder it is meaning the
more pain you go through the more W and
and fruition on the other end for me
personally so it's like if I have not
slept and and really really spent hours
trying to do the layoffs for example at
Airbnb in a unique way because we were
first in line for lack of better words
in the pandemic in terms of our business
getting hit so hard the way we ended up
doing it I truly believe had an impact
on layoffs in general so that was that
was like my reward of fruition so you
know some would say like my wife would
say I'm crazy but I say I love
it

hey everybody welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast where we get into the
real talk of company construction these
are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and board members behind closed doors
we're Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially
with people but on the show we tell the
truth and expect the same from our
guests I'm so excited for today's
episode with q hamani q started his
career in Consulting before being an HR
leader at jll he then interestingly
enough went to Airbnb during their
period of hyper growth where he led the
people operations function and then also
spearheaded their remote first
environment he's now the chief people
officer at paper so I've known Q for I
think about five years now um during his
stand at Airbnb and he's just always
been really refreshing Nolan I mean he
he's been in Consulting and finance
transformation and operations then into
HR so he's kind of just this Enigma of a
leader the things that he does it's all
over the place which is great and he
takes that all into the people role and
we heard that with his love of AI and
kind of how he's leaning into that very
hard yeah I think our audience is going
to love his curiosity around AI
specifically with people Ops in AI I a
lot of the folks in my network have been
asking like how does this apply to
people NH HR and q's actually one of the
foremost thinkers on that he started a
community there's now more than 300
people in that community and so we had a
deep conversation around that we also
talked about uh the layoff at Airbnb and
how to run layoffs the right way and we
also talked about like before the layoff
at Airbnb how Q spearheaded the everyone
can work remotely uh at arbn during the
the co pandemic and his role in that you
know it's easy to say that remote work
work anywhere but how they literally put
hours and hours and hours into making
that work for that size of an
organization it was it was really cool I
mean he he he's just so good at
demistifying things that are high level
Ai and HR remote work and we were able
to peel back yeah but like how how does
it work he's real is the way I would
describe Q so he's not going to he
didn't tell us the answer aners I wanted
to hear uh his answers were more like
yeah it took a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of work uh it
took working weekends for like a month
straight and then we made it happen one
of my bigger takeaways from Q is how a
people team needs to operate which is
staying ahead of the business and
oftentimes that is the grimy slimy hard
work that no one actually sees or feels
except for the people on the people team
yeah I I love that about Q it's not all
duckies and hores and hearts and hugs I
mean he's like it's freaking hard he's
coming from an Ops background and
sometimes you just got to grind through
it and and be honest about what it's
like yeah I also think he's going to be
the archetype for the future HR leader
he does not come from HR he is not like
born and raised in HR he comes from
Consulting and so I think we're going to
see a lot more Q types moving forward
totally with that said I just can't wait
for audience to hear the show and so
without further Ado here's q q Harman
welcome to the show we're so happy to
have you thanks for having me it's been
a while it's been a little while so so Q
your background is fascinating uh you
were a consultant you were then an
Airbnb through like the craziest phase
of airbnb's growth and now you're the
chief people officer at paper just give
the audience a quick background on your
career and what you've been up to so far
and specifically your areas of expertise
yeah so I think it's uh to to give that
context I'll go a little bit further
back just to give a holistic view um I
studied electrical engineering in
college I then minored in German because
I was like why not do something
different completely different did a
study abroad in Germany and that was fun
too um and then I started off my career
in finance because why not you know it
would it would be too easy if you just
went into engineering and I did Finance
for about 5 years Finance strategy and
Ops and then I did some Global strategy
and Ops cuz I always liked connecting
the I didn't like to be in one
discipline and then I O over that
duration of first seven years of doing a
lot of Consulting and finance I realized
like people can make or break the best
process or the best technology you have
like PE that was my learning so then I
said okay I've never never worked in the
people function so I should go explore
that because every right turn seems like
the best thing to do um so I tried to
get jobs in HR and I got Flatout
rejected so long story short I quit I
started my own consulting company which
was in HR technology and analytics this
is back in 2009 I started I knew people
soft from my finance days so I started
doing workday implementations in 2009
and that's how my career in HR quickly
started with technology blew into
operations and then basically all my
non-hr experience kept becoming more
valuable than my HR experience and uh I
was at a PE back firm for four years
where I basically it was my HR Academy I
did every role in HR there because it
was small from hrb B2 recruiting um went
to jll for a year and did large scale HR
and then I landed at Airbnb for the last
 
is an education technology company it's
not a brand definitely not as a frontend
center like Airbnb so our mission is we
have a learning platform that only plugs
into public school districts in the US
with a mission to reduce the inequality
gaps in learning that public schools
face from private schools so I'm the
chief people officer here the the
company had grown from a couple hundred
to a couple thousand in 18 months I also
expanded my role few months in into uh
Communications I took took on internal
Communications my week two because that
was my learning like if you can control
or have a thoughtful internal
communication strategy your people work
gets that much easier and now I also run
public relations and external coms cuz
your external message needs to tie into
your internal message so here I am 7
months into my new role I think the
engineer and me that has still stuck is
like go do sh that you've never done
before and just figure it out you'll
fail you'll fall you'll learn but if you
don't learn it's kind of boring um at
least from my perspective Q I'm
wondering how the how the engineer and
you handled that early rejection when
you decided to go into HR it's usually
people want to get out and you're trying
to get in I'd love any any hot takes on
those rejections or how that happened I
mean the rejections were were real but I
think in a lot of way they fueled me cuz
when someone tells me you can't do
something or it's not possible that's
enough to fire me up like that is what I
need so it it kind of fed my ambition in
a reverse way where I was like I want to
prove people wrong and I want to and
part of the reason I was so insistent on
doing this was twofold one was I had not
done it before and I was like um I want
to do it but the more broader thinking
was I can actually impact change in a in
a lot more scalable way if I go into the
people function because I'm helping the
whole organization and I guess coupled
with frustration because I was always
like pissed off a bit like I was not
getting the right partnership from my HR
partner either they were not
understanding my discipline enough and
they were leading with um the pro HR
programs that I felt like maybe I could
try and drive some chain obviously
timing is everything and you can't
control it but I think in that 20 2010
 
experience as a term um you know I think
I caught the wave of where people
leaders at the time and organizations
were looking for um uh HR professionals
to be more business oriented to
understand and treat HR just like you
would treat a product or any other thing
in your organization not a back office
function so I think it was right place
right time right ambition right
rejection I think that that moment's
actually still going on that's true yeah
a lot a lot of Founders and CEOs are
asking for chief people officers to come
from a business background I'm seeing
actually a lot of people transition over
from like the strategy and Ops side into
a CH people officer job you kind of have
done that just over a longer duration
I'm curious how that's helped inform how
you make decisions now at paper as the
chief people officer so I think it it
all has come together so when I when I
look at what we are trying to solve for
from a people standpoint I don't lead
with the people program or I don't even
lead with like what is the right HR way
to do it or what what is the people way
to do it I normally lead with what are
we trying to solve for the business so
it could be I'm deeply immersed with our
sales and customer facing team and
trying to find out you know it could an
example of a story which is real could
be like we need new comp plants we need
new incentive plans for sales and
customer teams and it's like why okay we
need it because we need to incentivize
more I would peel that onion and try to
go all the way Upstream to like what are
we trying to solve like is it our
pricing model what behaviors are we
trying what behaviors do we not want to
solve you may not want to sell deals
that are low margin or you may if your
strategy you know is to get into a
market share that you're not
but you have to start with like what are
you trying to solve what behaviors and
then the actual creating of the comp
plans is the last 20% that's easy to do
but you know historically or even in my
own fast when I when I worked through it
like a decade ago it would start with
comp plans and then like try to marry it
up so I think for me it's it's just
given me something that even at Airbnb
for five years honestly like the
programs I ended up create incubate I
incubated a lot of different programs in
HR that basically
um HR no one was doing in the company
and I just put my hand up to do and with
the pandemic I would say the Silver
Lining was there was a lot that got
thrown on hr's plate that HR had never
done before so it's the same process I
use a lot of design thinking you know I
try to empathize with different personas
Define what problem we're trying to
solve and then kind of work my way what
I call it um what I've called it over
the years is just I want to iterate
towards greatness so let's just figure
it out so so to your point it's really
all that non-hr experience um that I've
gathered over the years is actually
coming to fruition now in a pretty fun
and exciting way Q how do you balance
the design thinking and the the love for
iteration which I do as well with too
much change and
fatigue and right that that Dynamic I
mean it's it's you you try to like
bite-size it sometimes um you know
sometimes you don't balance it and you
just kill yourself I mean reality is
real I mean when I had to lead the
layoffs at Airbnb or even the living The
Nomad program that we came up I you know
I there was a period where I slept for
 
probably a couple hours for the weeks
before that and that was not bit- sizing
it but we didn't have a choice we
couldn't bite-size some something as big
as that so sometimes you can try to
bite-size it sometimes you don't you
just get through it and for me like my
uh My Philosophy is a little bit of um
the harder it is meaning the more pain
you go through
the more reward and and fruition on the
other end for me personally so it's like
if I have not slept and and really
really spent hours trying to do the
layoffs for example at Airbnb in a
unique way because we were first in line
for lack of better words in the pandemic
in terms of our business getting hit so
hard the way we ended up doing it I
truly believe had an impact on layoffs
in general um so that was that was like
my reward of fruition so for me it's
like sometimes I don't balance it well
and that's my weakness and but but on
the other end it satisfies me and keeps
me going to do it the next time so you
know some would say I like my wife would
say I'm crazy but I say I love it so I I
think that's refreshing like everyone's
right strides for the balance Nolan and
Q and sometimes it's just like you can't
you're just gonna you know get laid out
for a while I think it's a fallacy Kelly
I I think it's a fallacy I think like
you know work life balance like we got
really comfortable over the course of
the last 10 10 to 11 years it turns out
built a tech company is really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
hard and you know this notion that you
can go do it with 40 hours a week and
you know still be a millionaire at the
IPO I I think is is gone and I think
that that's generally a good thing
because like we need to work hard in
order to achieve outsized outcomes and Q
I think like you know Airbnb has
obviously like insane product Market fit
but I'm curious actually on this topic
going from Airbnb to paper which has a
much smaller brand what has that been
like for you so it's been humbling um
cuz I did know going into it that I was
a going into a sector that was not as
glamorous right like education and the
public sectors not like travel and
hospitality and B it was not an Airbnb
there's no better way to say that right
the brand was uh was not um already
there um it's been it's been tough but
it's it's been that's the the challenge
that I was looking for right like for me
I think I ground in and you know before
I took the job at paper I probably spoke
to 30 or 40 companies over one year cuz
I was very particular on where I wanted
to go next and for me the grounding
commonality was I wanted to be somewhere
where the mission was really strong and
relatable because we all have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] days
we all have crazy days especially in
this profession it's a pretty lonely job
and you know now I have maybe my GPT
buddy to talk at at night and come me
down but you know that's not you know I
don't know how far that'll go either but
um what what really can ground you at
the end of the day even in that I agree
with you work life balance I don't even
think the word balance is is is
appropriate it's like work life
integration and you figure out how to
just like you have to balance your life
on the personal front sometimes with a
kid or whatnot you have to like figure
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out you figure it out on the
workfront um but for me it's like at the
at the end of the day when I'm like
banging my head or or frustrated it's
like it's the mission it's we're trying
to change the next generation of
education at a time even if it's an inch
it's satisfying so if for me it's the
mission that's that's common in its own
unique way cuz I relate it to both the
missions but it's it's been humbling but
I knew that coming in right like I'm
giving um I'm moving to an organization
to drive my own impact and growth but
also um it comes it comes at it but that
said I would say there were some there
were some commonalities that I took from
Airbnb and still use every day right so
design thinking even though I would say
Loosely I did it for the last decade for
The Last 5 Years at Airbnb like that was
was how Airbnb operated and that was
that was with Brian's you know he's a
designer and that's everything it was
like what were the first principles how
are we looking at it how are we
prototyping and that's how we approached
our business honestly so for me that is
continued to to thread the other thing I
would say that I've continued to thread
at that I learned at Airbnb was Airbnb
was the first company where
Communications was part of HR that I
worked at and I thought that was so
impactful that I'm doing the same thing
at paper now and that intent
communication strategy your operating
system like I referred to it on how your
company the ways are working because
paper is a remote first company was Bond
remote right so Airbnb went from being
completely in person to being remote so
we could figure out how to sprinkle some
of the in person papers almost coming at
it from a different end of the spectrum
to the same side which is they were Bond
remote and what is that right infusion
of inperson so communication is critical
is what I've learned and I've carried
that forward because I think that's how
you thread it in a in in today's world
just want to be clear when when Q has
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] days he talks to chat GPT and I go
out and have B well I call it I go out
and have me PE drink bourbon with me so
I think I well you could do both you
know you could you could you could have
a bourbon with a yeah it's yeah both
things can be true as a I mean we're not
too far from maybe a GPT making making
you a good cocktail too right so maybe
maybe you have it ready for you it's
fantastic well I mean you all challenge
me on the balance right and I I get a
lot of questions from Street people
officers or HR folks how do you keep the
balance and how do you do this and one
of the things I I say is do anything you
can to try and get in front of the
eightball as fast as possible um and how
you set up your operating mechanisms how
you build your team because I think I
love your views on this but one of the
easiest ways to drown in these companies
is not to do that and you're taking on
too much and all of a sudden you're
underw waterer and you're not view as
strategic or you're just burn out either
way and you're kind of screwed so so I
love your your views on that yeah I
would say it's you know it's I would say
yes and no to your point like yes you
can plan for a lot of things and you
should have that foundational
infrastructure right like my first few
weeks was like really making sure my
people team had the right infrastructure
but now my job is I would say 70 80% not
even in the core HR space it's really
understanding the business understanding
the problems understanding how we can do
better to empower everyone through that
so I mean I think you can do some of it
but the reality of the job is which is
what is uh painful but what I love and
I'm I'm sure all of us love otherwise we
would not even be in this line of work
is every day is a different day you can
plan for the day at least for me like 60
 
even predicted you get used to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
getting thrown at you and you just have
to figure out like you know which one do
you dodge which one do you let stick for
another day or which one do you catch
and just like figure it out because no
one's going to do it for us that's the
that's the the crazy part right like
it's not like okay we can figure out if
we wait for this you know release or
wait for something it's it's all people
related stuff um so I don't know I think
it's tough but you just deal with um the
chaos um and you grow to like get a bit
uh used to it in a lot of ways yeah
speaking of you were instrumental in
running airbnb's layoff I think many
people have been in Tech have been
impacted by layoffs or have been on the
the side of having unfortunately to lay
people off that I I've been researching
it recently for a presentation I'm about
to do on layoffs and it's it's amazing
to me the media narrative that came out
of that which is this is a case study
for how other companies should do
layoffs Brian Airbnb CEO was lauded as
like this hero even though he laid off
almost 2,000 people can you give us the
story and like how that came to be
yeah so I think in typical Airbnb and
Brian fashion when we started planning
the layoffs you know we had the the HR
Playbook right like you do you do XYZ
you just give three months of Cobra and
you do XYZ and you kind of just you know
say bye-bye and you move on and when we
started looking at how we were going to
do it almost every single thing we said
we were going to do Brian's like no we
we need to do much better we need to
figure out how we can help the you know
help individuals especially because it
was a I'll give you a tactical example
we talked about Cobra and we were like
for the U which is more us specific as
you know and it was like 3 months 6
months maybe was the norm three months
for maybe was the norm at that time and
we were like we're in a healthcare
pandemic we got to give 12 months like
no matter what level they are right so
we started with our first principles
which was we need to start with empathy
we'll try to balance cost because
obviously this is a cost Play Because
business was impacted but we are going
to spend um and and do it right and then
we will kill ourselves so in in in kind
of the context of what I said of more
pain and more gain kind of thing um you
know we wanted to optimize for
one-on-one Communications we wanted to
optimize for the fact that um
individuals will be in a tricky position
and we want to make sure we're there to
support them another tactical example I
don't think any company had done this
before or I shouldn't say any because I
don't know for sure but um most
companies when they have a layoff the
access is cut off at the end of that day
or even sometimes when you tell them in
that day Brian was like I don't care
they need to have access for a full week
because I want everyone to say goodbyes
to everyone that's leaving this is this
is relationships and this caused angst
like with our it group they were like
this is a risk like any any company
would be like don't do it we ended up
doing it and that was I think uh another
piece so it came about in a very um in a
very atypical way because that's how we
approached it even though it was a
shitty situation we treated it with just
as much um effort design um and respect
as it would be um if we were hiring
someone and I think the key part of the
layoff that I learned and I've taken
with me as well is the people that were
not impacted we call them stayers or or
folks that are not being laid off we
emphasize so much on them too because
you often forget that they are also
impacted in in a unique where so we had
a lot of programming for them to make
sure we connected with them but you know
I just it you know it wasn't 30
countries so it was tough because our
layoffs literally went for about two and
a half days right by the time you
started in the US then Europe then APAC
and as you know the reality of layoffs
in Europe and APAC is the layoffs
actually not done for six or seven
months because you go through
consultation and you got to go through
it's not as easy as the US so it was uh
you know but I think coming back to your
point Nolan our philosophy at arban be
was always and this is something that
stuck with me to the extent I can which
is why I I love the community aspect of
anything which is we want to share what
we've done with the world so that they
can then leverage anything we've tried
to do so Brian's open letter which
became kind of like the Playbook right
that a lot of companies have used which
list out what we did how we stated it
out like that hit the streets like to
the external press literally a minute
after it went out to our employees
internally and it was the same letter um
so I think sharing what we've learned
even with the Nomad program at Airbnb
for future work it was same thing we
went through all these complexities like
let's share it with the world let
everyone benefit or create their own
version of what we've done um so the
open sourcing aspect of it was was was
something I love um because you just
feel that's where I think the reward and
the amplification that you at least
shared and even if someone got some
inspiration from something you shared it
feels like we we did something more than
just for ourselves in that
context hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors hey everybody you're your
co-host Nolan here high performance and
great culture should never be at odds
they're better together with Lattis
people management platform companies

below ping me on LinkedIn if you have
any questions or head to join continuum.
comom um Q Airbnb the your your role in
the live and work anywhere philosophy
and I know a lot of companies are
struggling with getting folks back in
now and back and forth I mean was that
easy I just by the looks of it it looked
like that was very simple this is what
we believe in this is it and I know it
couldn't be that did you have Push back
on that was there internal debate how
did that go yeah so that that live and
work anywhere program was probably
almost a 2-year experiment that we went
through before we came up with it um so
when the pandemic hit like March of 2020
when we were all sent home um I think in
July or August of 2020 we realized that
our employees wanted to start traveling
abroad and every time an employee
crosses borders you have risks in terms
of employment as we all know um and we
had a choice at that point said we could
tell employees like sorry you can't go
like just stay where you are or we can
support them and mind you at this point
in the pandemic it was not people were
traveling for leisure they wanted to go
back to loved ones they wanted to go
back to be socially sane cuz in a lot of
cities they were literally locked down
right there were curfews and stuff like
that um so we in typical Airbnb fashion
said we have no idea how we going to do
this we know it's going to be hella
complex we know no one's doing this for
a reason so let's take it on let's do it
because our employees need it so I think
there was a four or five day span where
I incubated and stood up this team
called digital Nomad program it was
augmented with Consultants who were tax
experts privacy experts like all the
complexities you can think of and we
essentially ran this program for 15
months where employees could open a
request we would do a in-depth analysis
to tell them the risks they would face
cover our risks and nine out of 10 times
they could go for about 182 days which
is the tax treaty limit in a lot of
countries and then they would come back
now BNB was not a remote company before
the pandemic we were in a lot but
because our offices were shut for two
years from March of 2020 to April of
 
remote work experiment and this includes
our leaders and Brian right so even
though we did not have unanimous
agreement on remote work like I would
think most organization on the
leadership team pre pandemic everyone
was in this experiment and what happened
was you know so March 2020 pandemic hits
April or May 2020 the headlines is
literally rest in peace rbnb uh we had
to raise a crazy amount of debt at a
very low valuation and then six months
later uh so in December of 2020 we had
an amazing IPO all remote right so the
the the argument of you can't work
remotely was kind of thrown out the door
because we had proof so when we when we
got into early 2022 fast forwarding 15
months into this Pand uh pandemic and
also into the global Nomad program that
I referenced that we launched we
realized that we had not taken a stance
on what type of company we're going to
be are we going to be a remote first
company are we going to call people back
into the office three days and we kept
seeing around us that you know companies
were calling people back for three days
but then there would be a new variant
and they would say oops sorry like you
know let's wait another time and we we
wanted to wait it out and see
essentially so in Feb of 2022 we said
all right now our employees are also
they need some direction and we need to
take take a stance cuz we can't just say
like we're indefinitely going to figure
it out but we knew that the world was
not going back to what it was pre
pandemic so we put up like a very small
task force for about eight weeks in kind
of a design Sprint kind of way and we
said let's figure out what our holistic
program is and we started with our first
principles what are we trying to solve
let's ideate let's think of personas and
basically what came out of that was the
simplified View at end of April 2022
that the world saw which was called the
live and work anywhere program it had
four dimensions to it um one was you can
work in the office or at home we don't
care you choose we're trusting you as
adults to make the right choice because
we want you to be output driven the
second one was I think we were one of
the first in Tech to do this especially
in the US uh we moved from um location
based Bay pay to Value based pay um so I
could move from San Francisco to Iowa
and my salary would be the same um the
third one which was our differentiator
and our focal point was that digital NAD
program that became you could live and
work around the world for 90 days at a
time we streamlined it so the overhead
was a little less so we brought it down
to 90 to mitigate the risk and also be
able to approve things quicker and the
fourth one was we still believe in
person is critical to what we do so we
will have intentional inperson
Gatherings through the year to Foster
that um that thing now the key Point
here is we knew that you know not all
four elements of that program will
relate to everyone but as long as when
you map out persona and think of
empathizing with different groups at
least one of them should relate to
someone right so I just had my kid I was
not going around the world 90 days at a
time but I was not going in and I could
spend morning I do morning routines for
my son every single day since that day
right so versus someone who wants to
travel could travel someone could move
to Florida or Iowa and they would they
would be know that they have their job
and they're not even giving up their pay
um so that's how it came about very
similar to the layoffs in terms of how
we approached it um with the difference
being we had had time on our side to
build a remote work program layoffs we
didn't really have that but it's it's
the same uh principle how we did it that
was a that was a different April 22 is
is right as things are starting to fall
off of the cliff or maybe like we're
already falling off the cliff and we
don't quite yet know it I'm curious now
looking back on that and saying okay if
it's November and 23 if I was doing this
again what would you change and I'm
asking because the thing that comes up
for me is like G geob based comp you
know making that value based comp sounds
awesome but you no longer have salary
Arbitrage which is more expensive for
the business so I'm curious would you
change anything given the circumstances
of today's market I would not especially
in that regards cuz we we removed
location based pay only within your
country of employment so it wasn't
Global oh interesting okay yeah sorry I
should have clarified that cuz I was
actually advising a bunch of web3
companies at the time and they went just
Global one pay right like they didn't
care within so ours was specifically
within a country so if you move to
London or you moved to Paris from from
San Francisco you were getting localized
so it was just so the so the
differential so you know when you look
at the tier one and tier to location
based pay what were they like maybe 15%
I don't know what the latest was right
 
things were starting to get normalized
because a lot of the locations like I
don't know maybe Texas or Chicago or
Florida where there was an inbound of
folks during the pandemic they were
starting to I I felt like the
differential was going down a little bit
anyways because of the distribution of
Workforce so you're giving up like 8 to
 
hiring Talent your diversity like you
talk about like at the end of a real
data point at the end of our one year of
launching this program at Airbnb our
engagement scores were at the highest
they had ever been in the8 years since
we started tracking engagement right our
diversity scores were at the highest
they had ever been in the seven years
since we started tracking diversity so
for us and output you know uh the whole
reason we did this was we went we went
uh and did a successful IPO um in in a
remote environment so we continue to
track like we do two semiannual releases
Airbnb moved to that last year as we
moved to single road map they were going
great we were we were coordinated we had
intentionality so output was good people
happy we had an ease of hiring people
like we would when I was there like we
would close down job recks in a few
weeks cuz we would get thousands of
applicants from around the world and
that's a good problem to have um so I
think uh why change why change it is is
what I would go to I think the biggest
thing because I you know there's the
whole future of work debate has ended up
becoming like return to office or remote
I hope it's now going to change with
like what what is technology going to
change with the whole AI Revolution it's
going to come at some point or the other
um I think it's it's it's not for
everyone though right so I it was for
Airbnb and one of the reasons why the
program became so big and one of the
ideas I pitched was the fact that how it
is this goes to your original question
Nolan of like how all my other
experiences are coming together is that
the reason this program works so well
for us and for for us was because it not
only related to the employees but it
worked amazingly for our business right
and if you find that magic um connection
that's where the magic happens right so
it was great we were telling the world
go and live and work anywhere on airbnbs
we were uniquely positioned because
Airbnb had the supply of homes to host
people we had one of the number one
barriers of living and working anywhere
after our like 15mon Global Nomad
program which I refer to like my on the
job PhD and tax treaties and privacy
laws and all that was the number one
barrier is work authorization which is
visas right and we realized I Iz that we
have a large public policy team that
works with Regulators to make sure that
airbnbs can be legalized so we said why
don't we harness the same power to help
influence visas and Regulatory
restrictions so that our employees can
travel the anyone in any company can let
their employees travel and together they
hopefully all live in the homes we have
it's like a win-win situation so those
were magic moments actually where we
realized oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like we have a when I
real there was a point like I think in
March where I realized oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we have a
public policy team that can break down
this barrier for us and I remember
talking to exact team and I said look we
have a we have a choice we could follow
what everyone's doing and just go with
the flow or we have a unique opportunity
with our business model and our
Workforce in terms of how we are
structured with regulators and cities to
drive tourism which is kind of the other
side of that coin where we can really
like lead this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] break the barrier
and help do it and you know in typical
airbn fashioned way it's like no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we
got to do that like that's what that's
what we always do and that's how I got
the support to kind of do that awesome C
to Nolan's point right right before the
market kind of fell off and you know
especially the last year or so with a
lot of macro issues and a lot of
companies having Revenue challenges and
you've I've at least seen this this push
to get back in the office we need that
to get things back on track and those
things have been correlated and I'm
assuming that was not a problem for for
you all no no it's not no it's I mean
again we we had inperson connection so
we had to have like if the design team
was doing a Sprint they were in person
maybe for a week or two but I think to
be honest like in um I think the the
leaders that are saying you have to be
in person to turn it around or bring
back morale I think they're just being
lazy um I think they want to be in their
comfort zone um which again it's not
wrong if I'm comfortable with something
just own it and just be like I want to
be in that zone because I believe that's
what's best for me and it's okay if I
lose people in the process don't like
try to have your cake and eat it too
right like that's I think what's going
on a little bit which kind of is
annoying sometimes when you read the
headlines it's and I think the the other
thing is like everyone thinks what
they're doing is the only right way and
they're so opinionated about it that
there is no other way to do it and it it
kind of annoys it it's it's getting old
and annoy I tend to agree we we T we
talked about a bit about this with Steve
right the episode that actually launched
today um that that that we really don't
know what the future would bring and we
should own that with AI and what you
mentioned Q so I think there's two camps
here one Camp is is is kind of like
these people who are full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who
are like oh we want to bring people back
but really like they just want to
monitor you I think another Camp is
we're pre-product Market fit even though
we've raised a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money and we
need to actually like get this thing to
work and we believe getting this thing
to work is a lot easier if people are in
the office and I think like for that
that one I understand and if you're cool
with that awesome we're going to move
slower on on open reck and I think
that's the thing that like you know to
to Q's Point CEOs who who want to eat
their cake too it's like well you know
can't we move faster on recruiting like
d turn turns out you can yeah yeah I
mean I was talking to a Founder I think
it was a couple weeks week ago and he
had like 20 people so relatively small
company um very early stage and he was
like I love you know having people in
every day because we're trying to figure
out what we're doing I was like if
you're and he was like I think all my
people like it too because they're all
trying to figure out what we're doing I
was like then then don't fight it like
that is the right model for you come
into the office you're 20 people if
everyone loves coming in you're
whiteboarding do it do it like don't
feel like you have to do something else
just because someone else told you it's
good like figure out what works for you
and then just own it um because I think
employees also my guess is are getting
sick and tired of the stuff right like
where they can read between the lines
like someone else I was talking to and
they were like our CEO said everyone
needs to come in four days a week or
whatever it was and they're like none of
our leadership team is ever in there
they hope so you know employees can see
like that that level is like you know so
I think leaders included get carried
away with like okay Apple's doing this
it's thought to be amazing cuz we're so
used to looking up to like organizations
like apple and apple is an amazing
organization I don't mean it in a
negative context but look up to them for
maybe their product and their
inspiration and not everything blindly
because you're then just going to
copycat it's good to have a contrarian
culture like stand for something don't
just do the vanilla thing that everyone
else is doing but also realize you want
people to opt into that culture and it's
it's amazing when they opt out you have
dodged a bullet and you don't have to
deal with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down the road and so
many Founders get into this mode
especially during recruiting it's like
recruit at all cost like we got to have
this person and you're just so much
better off if that person doesn't want
to be here like let's just let them go
try try but trying to be all things to
all people right is is is that perfectly
said Kelly it's hard it's hard not to
right when you're competing for talent
you're trying to do this it's like you
could you can be the most polarizing
nope and that perfect candidates here
well maybe we'll let them work from
Kansas because they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great and
then it just spirals out of so it's I
get it I get it but it is it is easier
said than done and that's where I think
some of our role is is empathizing with
these Founders too and working with them
through it because they're in a tough
spot and calling their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
that's calling their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with a hug
Nolan I mean sometimes you yeah you I
mean I'm not saying punch them in the
face but like you don't have to you
don't have to me are not I mean you know
it's it's not I mean you know sometimes
it's telling it raw like you have to
like you know even in my current role I
you know love both the co-founders in
the in the context of working and we we
challenge each other and it's been seven
months in so we have an amazing
relationship but there were times when I
was breaking in at paper where I was
like I could play soft or I could just
tell them really like this was not what
we should have done and be very
opinionated because I believe in
something and I think we could have done
it and I took those risks not knowing
like am I going to lose my job then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
it like that's fine um but every time I
did that they actually wanted to hear
that and over time they would they've
started to tell me like Q like what do
you think and if I'm like you know not
saying anything they like they they
would get it out of me so I think you
just got to be real but also um do it in
a way where you know I think they're
counting on us for that is kind of what
I'm saying yeah that that is that is the
job you know it is it is the job but I
want to unpack that for a second because
not all founders want to hear no
actually many Founders want to just most
Founders actually just want to want yes
people around them how did you assess
for that during your interview process
so I would say before I jump to that I
would be like part of it was luck right
cuz you can never assess it completely
right so part of it was I got lucky um
cuz you just never know you can't just
like they can't just like your hiring
success rate is probably what 50 60%
it's the same on the other side right
right it's not different people are
people so I'm in a co-founder situation
and I try to ask them when things don't
go your way how do you react when things
don't go exactly the way you want how do
you how how do you react how do you how
do you sort out misalignments and I have
now can say with confidence after living
through it every day when when we when
the two co-founders for example don't
see eye to ey which is which is good
because that's what the complimentary
nature is in in some situations they can
hash it out and now it's three of us we
can hash it out we can talk through it
nine out of 10 times we are aligned at
the end of that conversation because
we've heard each other out on pros and
cons and where we are coming from one
out of 10 times we don't but we agree
that okay this is the best gamble to
take at that time so for me it was um a
bit of a um you know wild shot um a
lottery I would say in that regards that
I got lucky but and then tried to
through the process um ask how do you
how do you work through situations where
you don't get what you want you don't
like the answer um and take it from
there the other thing you said which I
think is important for exec to hear is
that you you you got to this moment in
which do I say it or do I not say it and
then you're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it I'm GNA say it
and if they don't like it like they're
going to fire me that actually I think
is like getting to that level of clarity
early is healthy because if you're just
going to go along for the ride and live
with all this angst and like I wish it
could be differently I don't I think
you're you're kind of a weak exact but
but wait but wait that's that I agree
that is my viewpoint now but I'm just
thinking back to when I was 31 and my
first head of people rooll I I I don't
know I mean I was definitely a little
more cautious maybe you're learning
maybe you're that but it's it's hard to
do so let's just be real about that H
how do you get there well I think it's
fair like that's exactly the framework
which is if you're in a firsttime exec
seat you got to be really careful about
picking and choosing your battles if
you've been around the block I think
your tolerance for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is very low
and so you know but I I still even see
people who've been around the block who
deal with all of this crap and it's
their own fault and it's it's the it's
these it's these moments in which am I
going to actually speak my mind and
speak truth in a way that's obviously
like professional and understanding of
the other side or am I just going to go
along for the ride and I think
unfortunately a lot of people end up
just going along for the ride you know
you just a light bulb just went on my
doesn't happen often a light bulb just
went off in my head and I well we
succeeded no we succeeded seven episodes
in 700 watt and I I advise a lot of
firsttime heads of people now and I just
realized that you said something Dolan
you know when to pick your battles I
didn't even know what was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
battle and what wasn't and that's half
of it is that's what I try to help the
new Nuance with first-time heads of
people that I talk to is you might not
know it but this is actually a pretty
big thing it's a battle and or this
isn't and that that is that is very
helpful it's very helpful yeah I think
picking your battles is is our it should
be like number one in our job
description right because no matter no
matter how much you want to you know
opinionate or fight back you are always
picking battles because you're trying to
weigh out like where's the impact on
what you're picking in the people
profession but I I do agree but I think
it's also interesting because because to
your point Nolan like some Founders
don't want to be challenged um I got
lucky but like what if I I mean not
everyone is like that so what do you do
in that situation you you know they're
looking for someone that is not going to
challenge them and you know to the best
they represent that going in um and
sometimes I look at that in um in what
stage the company is in right like if
it's a series a series B company and you
know at least um pre Cliff of the market
for or if you're in an AI boom right now
hiring is the key kind of component of
that job right um and to me like the
reason I don't go that early is because
I don't want to just be focused on
hiring I want to focus on actually the
business and I think I don't know I'm
actually saying this out loud I haven't
finished my thought as I'm speaking as
well but maybe because I'm going in that
slightly later stage I'm putting myself
in that business partnering role that
I'm in trickier situations where it is
um like I can I can wice my opinion
that's that may be different I don't
know what do you guys think yeah I I I P
I personally think as you get more
senior your tolerance for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets
less you know which which battles to
fight and which just to like let roll
and your ability to spot those things
from a ways out is it can help you avoid
being in like you know I'm battling on
every single one of these things which
ruins relationships I I also think like
time has helped us the industry has
gotten more mature they've gotten
smarter boards Founders they're they've
wisened up the importance of this role
and what it is have they though across
the board I think a lot more people get
it than they did before come on 15 years
ago they were like what the hell do you
do I think people outside I think people
outside get it I don't know if people
inside the industry get it as much as I
would like I I in my conversations with
founder I feel like they're they've it's
a different world than it was 15 16 17
years ago with the view the views on HR
everyone wants an HR not that they don't
get everyone wants this role now
everyone knows it's not just a
compliance role anymore and so I think
the leeway and the expectation for us to
have opinions and be strong that's more
expected than it was
before yeah I agree too I was I wanted
to tee that up to see what facilitating
us no yeah q i I actually wanted to talk
about AI and uh you know you just
started a community uh for people GPT I
I just want to get your sense of where
do you think the puck is going for HR
recruiting and people Ops more broadly
yeah so I think I'll start off with just
you know AI is so broad right like and I
think up until last weekend I knew AI is
a great technology but I thought it's
pretty inflated and then obviously I've
been using chat GPT over the past few
months like writing job descriptions you
name it it's helped me in in a lot of
stuff but what happened last weekend has
changed my mindset significantly because
as you may know open AI launched a
custom GPT Builder what that means in
very simple terms is someone like you
and me can just go and talk to a
computer literally speak to it tell it I
want to build a bot to do XYZ it should
act like this it should speak like this
it should look up salary information
from here and you can you can just very
easily talk to it and it creates one for
you now that changed my my mind
completely in a way where not only um it
can revolutionalize the way we work so
to your point I think or to answer your
question I think there's two Dimensions
one is it can change the field of HR
internally on how we run HR so there's
things basic things like automations um
that can be done very seamlessly now
with no programming you just talk to it
and it'll do it end to end I think then
what it can start doing is um start
helping us evaluate all the pieces is we
need to be a better business partner so
for example um one of the uh people gpts
that I released it's called job crafter
and basically what it does is I I talk
to it just like I'm talking to you
probably like just like I'm talking to a
human so that's why I keep joking this
is my my new friend that I create um and
I said I think I need help with
compensation and it'll ask me like why
do you need it what are you trying to
solve it'll then uh suggest titles for a
job I may want to hire to fill that
it'll suggest reporting lines based on
like the team size and all that it will
then ask me for a few questions and I'll
just answer like very blatantly too like
go scrub paper. careers to find more
info about the company like and it'll
ask me for job qualifications I'll be
like I don't know you tell me and it
will create a really beautiful job
description by scrubbing getting all the
information then I asked it like give me
some salary data it pulled from various
sources and gave me salary data which
was pretty freaking accurate because I
tested it for London for San Francisco
um and then I said this is awesome thank
you so much can you just go create the
recck for me in workday like I don't
have time for this and I don't don't
like doing it and the bot was like well
we're not connected to your work system
your's a step by step Aid and then I
learned that it there's another tab
called configure where or actions I
can't remember where I can actually
connect workday with an API and it'll do
the wreck end to end so where it can
change internal HR is not just in the
boring backend operations now it's like
actually the value that a person can get
um I think more broadly um it will
change every single discipline in the in
the way I just explained for HR and
that's just one use case right there's
so many use cases out there um that I
think people are going to have to start
figuring out um how they adapt their
work life how they adapt their ways of
working I'm you know I think I'm 100%
convinced we will be able to do more
with less the same the same work that we
do today however like just when the
calculator came out people who were
doing addition and subtraction manually
didn't just fall off the workforce they
figure out other things to do like
humans as a species we will figure out
what is the next thing we can do with
this power it's going to change the ways
of working it's going to change how I
think the organ the definition of
organizational design is going to be
Rewritten in terms of context like one
school of thought is you don't need any
back office functions you just need a
business partner who can basically get
resources like one of the Bots you tell
it which country or city you are and
it'll tell you employment law for that
country like you don't even need to talk
to a lawyer right um so so there it's
going to change internally how HR
operates to your point recruiting
actually has been ahead of this game
right there's been a lot of AI interview
intelligence in recruiting for a few
years now um but I think it's going to
change the way we can automate the way
we can partner and then on the external
front it's going to change how every
organization every function within an
organization adapts to it and I think
the power for me is like to to the same
point we opened the podcast with 10
years ago or 12 years ago whatever it
was when I moved to HR was to help um
you know drive and be at the Forefront
of how ways are working and how we
connected to the business that is going
to change Q how how fast do you think
that we'll adopt that yeah I think you
know what I'm talking about is probably
like I don't know if I have to just
throw a swag probably two to five years
somewhere in that Horizon it's not going
to be overnight but I think and the
reason I started this people GPT
Community was I think HR in general or
the people function um are not in their
comfort zone when they're trying to play
with technology right like this is so
easy to do like it it is crazy how
conversational it is to do something
that I want to try and make sure that we
don't get left behind in the people
function we are kind of leading and
testing it because if we do that then we
can actually help the rest of the
organization and then we don't even cut
ourselves out of a discipline like I I
totally agree with you I feel feel like
HR leaders are being left behind but
it's by their own doing they're a little
scared to just like get in there and
play with the tech and so you know my
take to people and my advice is just
that you have to become AI native
because if you don't someone else will
and they will it's not Tech will replace
you it's another human that knows the
tech that's going to replace you ex
exactly exactly and I think to the to
that point what I refer to AI in this
context I'm using the word just cuz I
haven't thought of a better one I call
it combined intelligence because I do
think a human in the loop will be needed
like even in the example I put out on
the job crafting like at some point you
got to do a sanity check on the salary
like is it right does it feel right does
the job description feel right or you
need to tweak it so it's not like I mean
maybe for some automations sure like
even that humans hate doing you can
automate because it's like create a job
wck and work there there's nothing
exciting about that um to go in and do
that but there will be humans in the
loop um and the question is will it be
you or will it be someone else that's
learned that ability to use it um and
then you know this is just from gpt3 3.5
to 4 right I read today morning GPT 5 is
already in the works like who knows
where this is going to go but I will say
I'll I'll wrap this topic because I
could otherwise go on for hours and and
and nights probably with it but there is
a dark side to it too right so we do
have to be cognizant on you know what is
uh you know I'm still kind of confused
on like what is the IP and and you know
where is the IP coming from where is it
there there's a dark side like Nolan I
could build a GPT called Nolan GPT and
say answer in a very harsh tone and be a
jackass and and take content from Kelly
and please don't build chat
G I'm not but like my point is like that
that is the dark side you don't know
what's going to happen so we have to be
and again HR can be at the Forefront of
figuring out how to responsibly use this
in a workplace cuz it'll get fallen on
us who's going to figure it out I know
who's going to be my personal tutor when
five comes out you are going to be my
personal tutor um so just to transition
to our segment to wrap up here uh we
call it Talent rules uh two quick rapid
fire questions for you um first is your
favorite interview question that gets
you a really good signal on
candidates yep my first one is actually
I think Molly said it so I'm going to
give you another one which is tell me
your story which is that that's always
my go to cuz sometimes like I start
answering that with where I was born and
how I went to boarding school so it's
like it you can see where people take it
either they just talk about their work
accomplishments or themselves as a
person so I will give you another one
because I heard Molly's episode and I
think she said that the other one I try
to use is tell me your superpower just
tell me what it is and sometimes the
candidate will talk about like you know
I could say like oh I launched the airb
and we live and work in anywhere program
which is okay cool but what I'm really
looking for is like I love a challenge
um and I can bring I can bring um ideas
into reality even if it means killing
myself or I'm super calm in Crazy
situations like that's what I'm looking
for so for me it's like tell me a
superpower or the first one is tell me a
story and let them take it however they
want it and then tell me a superpower
awesome great um second one is who has
been your best hire and why that's a
tough one I would
say one of my biggest uh I would say a
few of my I'm not going to take names
but I would say like few of my uh best
hires in HR have been from outside HR um
and when I for example when I was
building people Ops um teams I would
hire people from customer support and
customer success and they were always
like a great fit because they would try
to understand um in the service delivery
mechanism of HR so I I I'm I don't want
to take names because there's too many
or I just don't want to do that but um I
would say hiring people in people Ops
from this different functions especially
like marketing or customer support um
have been my most successful because
those people know the business exactly
they know the business they know how to
relate yeah it's really why do you think
why do you think that that's a been a
pattern versus people with an HR
background I mean I think people with an
HR background have been successful and
kind of like if I want a comp person
then it's a comp person I think it's
they've been successful ful basically
for what you said right they have that
lens of empathizing and understanding
context in the business and honestly
that is the job of a people profession I
think you know even like I have this
whole Saga about like compensation
analysts too like the a compensation as
a function is there to over complicate
things um because you can simplify a lot
of that but if you hire people to do
that I'm not saying that's not a good
profession I'm not trying to you know
say get out of it it but to me it's like
you get what you ask for and sometimes
when you don't know you know um you're
asking for something different it it
surprises you awesome Q any anything
going into 2024 that you think the
audience should be aware of or what are
you expecting going into next year I
would hope the market changes next year
but we don't know I don't think it's in
the first half maybe in the second half
so continuing to be disciplined the the
days of like just spend at any cost and
just do whatever to to make folks happy
like I think people they will almost be
forced to connect to the business cuz
otherwise you're not going to be you're
not going to sustain it so I hope that
Trend continues and hopefully it's an
acceleration of the profession in
totality amen H harmoni thanks so much
for the time thanks so much Q yep thanks
