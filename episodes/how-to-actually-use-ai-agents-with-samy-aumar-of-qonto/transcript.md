## Transcript

 
Hey everyone, this week on Heretics,
 
Hey everyone, this week on Heretics,
we're sharing a special episode of 10X
 
we're sharing a special episode of 10X
Recruiting dedicated to demoing how
 
Recruiting dedicated to demoing how
execs are actually using AI. Just a note
 
execs are actually using AI. Just a note
that for those listening to the podcast
 
that for those listening to the podcast
who want to see the demo, you can find
 
who want to see the demo, you can find
the video version on the HR Heretic
 
the video version on the HR Heretic
Substack or YouTube page. What's up
 
Substack or YouTube page. What's up
everybody? Welcome back to another
 
everybody? Welcome back to another
episode of TEDx Recruiting brought to
 
episode of TEDx Recruiting brought to
you by Metaview. S, what's up man? It's
 
you by Metaview. S, what's up man? It's
good to see you. Good to see you too,
 
good to see you. Good to see you too,
man. What's up with you? Uh it's you
 
man. What's up with you? Uh it's you
know it's another beautiful day here in
 
know it's another beautiful day here in
Salt Lake City. But today is actually an
 
Salt Lake City. But today is actually an
exciting day sle because we are
 
exciting day sle because we are
launching a new series called How I AI.
 
launching a new series called How I AI.
When you brought this up I was like all
 
When you brought this up I was like all
right like let's let's kind of run a
 
right like let's let's kind of run a
couple of these and see how it goes. And
 
couple of these and see how it goes. And
it turns out that actually people
 
it turns out that actually people
sharing their screen. I was blown away
 
sharing their screen. I was blown away
with what I'm learning on how people are
 
with what I'm learning on how people are
actually using AI in their recruiting
 
actually using AI in their recruiting
workflows today. Meta View obviously an
 
workflows today. Meta View obviously an
AI product within the recruiting space.
 
AI product within the recruiting space.
you have tens of thousands of people
 
you have tens of thousands of people
using the product, but I see every day
 
using the product, but I see every day
like quite a large variance between the
 
like quite a large variance between the
sort of the most sophisticated users of
 
sort of the most sophisticated users of
AI and the least sophisticated. Now, the
 
AI and the least sophisticated. Now, the
more effort you're putting into
 
more effort you're putting into
orchestrating the AI, the more you're
 
orchestrating the AI, the more you're
getting out of it. It's sort of people
 
getting out of it. It's sort of people
need to see it to know, you almost need
 
need to see it to know, you almost need
to see some examples of it to start to
 
to see some examples of it to start to
think about how you can match that up
 
think about how you can match that up
against your workflow. So, I think this
 
against your workflow. So, I think this
is going to be great for people who are
 
is going to be great for people who are
looking to futureroof themselves, start
 
looking to futureroof themselves, start
to really build up intuition for how to
 
to really build up intuition for how to
bring AI into the center of your
 
bring AI into the center of your
workflow, not just like play with it on
 
workflow, not just like play with it on
the margins. So Sammy Omar is at KTO and
 
the margins. So Sammy Omar is at KTO and
we had an amazing conversation about how
 
we had an amazing conversation about how
he is actually using AI and again he's
 
he is actually using AI and again he's
showing his screen going under the hood
 
showing his screen going under the hood
showing us how he built his workflows,
 
showing us how he built his workflows,
how much effort went into these things.
 
how much effort went into these things.
So what were your takeaways from our
 
So what were your takeaways from our
conversation with Sam? AI mandates work.
 
conversation with Sam? AI mandates work.
They had an AI mandate sort of maybe
 
They had an AI mandate sort of maybe
maybe about sort of six or so months
 
maybe about sort of six or so months
into our partnership with them. And the
 
into our partnership with them. And the
fact is when you create an environment
 
fact is when you create an environment
in a company where hey the expectation
 
in a company where hey the expectation
is you're working out how to use this to
 
is you're working out how to use this to
give you leverage then these are the
 
give you leverage then these are the
results that you get. You can play the
 
results that you get. You can play the
role of the architect here. Now
 
role of the architect here. Now
obviously I look at some of these things
 
obviously I look at some of these things
and I think there's a long tale of
 
and I think there's a long tale of
workflows out there and you know you can
 
workflows out there and you know you can
be the architect. You can be almost the
 
be the architect. You can be almost the
designer of these systems because
 
designer of these systems because
they're they're so intuitive to work
 
they're they're so intuitive to work
with. So I'd say that be my second one.
 
with. So I'd say that be my second one.
Okay. So I got two as well. The first
 
Okay. So I got two as well. The first
one for me is no engineers needed. The
 
one for me is no engineers needed. The
story I was telling myself is that it's
 
story I was telling myself is that it's
going to take a week for me to set this
 
going to take a week for me to set this
thing up. I don't have the time to do
 
thing up. I don't have the time to do
it. Maybe there's going to be some
 
it. Maybe there's going to be some
technical aspect here that's a little
 
technical aspect here that's a little
bit overwhelming and causing some
 
bit overwhelming and causing some
anxiety in me. And it turns out none of
 
anxiety in me. And it turns out none of
that is true. One of the ones he showed
 
that is true. One of the ones he showed
us he built in an afternoon. He said I
 
us he built in an afternoon. He said I
actually toyed around after and I built
 
actually toyed around after and I built
one in 15 minutes. Just start and toy
 
one in 15 minutes. Just start and toy
around with it. You're already at a much
 
around with it. You're already at a much
better position than you were before you
 
better position than you were before you
started. This is not like some you don't
 
started. This is not like some you don't
need to bring in your DevOps team or
 
need to bring in your DevOps team or
your internal tools team to come help
 
your internal tools team to come help
you do this. You can do this on your own
 
you do this. You can do this on your own
being completely untechnical like me.
 
being completely untechnical like me.
We're just about start that time where
 
We're just about start that time where
you've got a bit of a free pass to try
 
you've got a bit of a free pass to try
things fail and mess up and so yeah I
 
things fail and mess up and so yeah I
think I totally agree like yeah
 
think I totally agree like yeah
obviously just just get started. Yeah.
 
obviously just just get started. Yeah.
The second one for me is B minus outputs
 
The second one for me is B minus outputs
beat blank pages. So this stuff isn't
 
beat blank pages. So this stuff isn't
perfect yet. People need to understand
 
perfect yet. People need to understand
that going in. I just like uploaded it
 
that going in. I just like uploaded it
into chat GBT, had a conversation with
 
into chat GBT, had a conversation with
my custom GPT on this, got something
 
my custom GPT on this, got something
that was like a 85%ish sort of a thing.
 
that was like a 85%ish sort of a thing.
Then I spent 15 minutes putting, you
 
Then I spent 15 minutes putting, you
know, the Nolan spin on it and it was
 
know, the Nolan spin on it and it was
done. I got back to this customer in an
 
done. I got back to this customer in an
hour. That was never the case for any
 
hour. That was never the case for any
job description I've ever worked on in
 
job description I've ever worked on in
my career. It may not be perfect, but it
 
my career. It may not be perfect, but it
stimulates new ideas that you hadn't had
 
stimulates new ideas that you hadn't had
before and gets you there faster. So, I
 
before and gets you there faster. So, I
love the idea of no longer starting with
 
love the idea of no longer starting with
a blank page and starting at like, you
 
a blank page and starting at like, you
know, you're like in the red zone about
 
know, you're like in the red zone about
to throw a touchdown. Sammy is a
 
to throw a touchdown. Sammy is a
recruiting operations person. And he is
 
recruiting operations person. And he is
setting this up so that he can actually
 
setting this up so that he can actually
control the quality of output across his
 
control the quality of output across his
company. So, what you don't probably
 
company. So, what you don't probably
want actually if you're one of the
 
want actually if you're one of the
people in the, you know, trying to
 
people in the, you know, trying to
orchestrate recruiting within your
 
orchestrate recruiting within your
company is just letting a thousand
 
company is just letting a thousand
flowers bloom and everyone has their own
 
flowers bloom and everyone has their own
interpretation of what a great JD is.
 
interpretation of what a great JD is.
You can get you the sort of AI output up
 
You can get you the sort of AI output up
to an A and A plus. And then you can
 
to an A and A plus. And then you can
also say, and guess what? This is now
 
also say, and guess what? This is now
available to everyone in my company. So
 
available to everyone in my company. So
that now there's no excuse for anyone
 
that now there's no excuse for anyone
having a B minus output actually because
 
having a B minus output actually because
I've done this for you. Watch this
 
I've done this for you. Watch this
because like when you see it with your
 
because like when you see it with your
own eyes, you will begin to believe Sil
 
own eyes, you will begin to believe Sil
and I when we tell you like the future
 
and I when we tell you like the future
is here and it's not as crazy hard as
 
is here and it's not as crazy hard as
you think it is to implement it. So
 
you think it is to implement it. So
without further ado, here is our episode
 
without further ado, here is our episode
with Sammy from KTO. Hope you guys enjoy
 
with Sammy from KTO. Hope you guys enjoy
it. This is 10X Recruiting, a podcast
 
it. This is 10X Recruiting, a podcast
from Metaview. Let's get after it.
 
from Metaview. Let's get after it.
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of 10X Recruiting. This
 
another episode of 10X Recruiting. This
is a special episode, an AI focused
 
is a special episode, an AI focused
episode called How I AI in Recruiting,
 
episode called How I AI in Recruiting,
which Sle gave me a great idea on a
 
which Sle gave me a great idea on a
couple weeks ago. And so we have Sammy
 
couple weeks ago. And so we have Sammy
Omar here from KTO. Sammy, what's up,
 
Omar here from KTO. Sammy, what's up,
man? Welcome to the show. Good, good. I
 
man? Welcome to the show. Good, good. I
hope you're all well and uh thanks for
 
hope you're all well and uh thanks for
inviting me. Yeah, we're stoked to have
 
inviting me. Yeah, we're stoked to have
you. So S, what's what's the deal with
 
you. So S, what's what's the deal with
this idea? Like give people the rundown.
 
this idea? Like give people the rundown.
Yeah. Well, it's I think it's like
 
Yeah. Well, it's I think it's like
increasingly becoming the the real topic
 
increasingly becoming the the real topic
of the day, which is less uh hey, how do
 
of the day, which is less uh hey, how do
I experiment with AI, which used to be
 
I experiment with AI, which used to be
what people were were sort of focused on
 
what people were were sort of focused on
maybe for the last couple of years, and
 
maybe for the last couple of years, and
now it's become much more how do I make
 
now it's become much more how do I make
AI central to my workflow? And we know
 
AI central to my workflow? And we know
we have some amazing Metav view
 
we have some amazing Metav view
customers who have AI central to their
 
customers who have AI central to their
recruiting workflow, and we just wanted
 
recruiting workflow, and we just wanted
to show and tell how to do it. Uh that
 
to show and tell how to do it. Uh that
said, some of this is going to be new to
 
said, some of this is going to be new to
me, too. I'm going to learn a ton about
 
me, too. I'm going to learn a ton about
how people are using these things. Uh it
 
how people are using these things. Uh it
is a it is the I don't want to say it's
 
is a it is the I don't want to say it's
the wild west out there but it's a new
 
the wild west out there but it's a new
frontier so there should be surprising
 
frontier so there should be surprising
things that we're all seeing and I think
 
things that we're all seeing and I think
the best way to learn is to sort of you
 
the best way to learn is to sort of you
know show and tell. So that's what this
 
know show and tell. So that's what this
is about. Yeah. So I would describe this
 
is about. Yeah. So I would describe this
as like a practitioners episode right
 
as like a practitioners episode right
like if you are actually working in
 
like if you are actually working in
recruiting this episode is for you. So
 
recruiting this episode is for you. So
Sammy you're going to show your screen
 
Sammy you're going to show your screen
and run us through how you use AI. So
 
and run us through how you use AI. So
please pop it up and give us the
 
please pop it up and give us the
rundown. Sure. Uh thanks a lot for for
 
rundown. Sure. Uh thanks a lot for for
the intro. I think I have two distinct
 
the intro. I think I have two distinct
use cases that could give a some ideas
 
use cases that could give a some ideas
to uh our listeners and watchers. So I'm
 
to uh our listeners and watchers. So I'm
going to share my screen um up like
 
going to share my screen um up like
this.
 
this.
Okay, you should see my screen on a meta
 
Okay, you should see my screen on a meta
view transcript. So this is not an ad
 
view transcript. So this is not an ad
for metav view. We didn't consult before
 
for metav view. We didn't consult before
on this. I I promise. Um but one first
 
on this. I I promise. Um but one first
thing of course that we do uh and the
 
thing of course that we do uh and the
first use case we wanted to track was
 
first use case we wanted to track was
having AI uh quality transcripts of our
 
having AI uh quality transcripts of our
interviews. So I'm not going to do a
 
interviews. So I'm not going to do a
full demo of Metaview of course but I'm
 
full demo of Metaview of course but I'm
just showing you that uh one of the cool
 
just showing you that uh one of the cool
features is that you can of course copy
 
features is that you can of course copy
a summary or download as a PDF uh the
 
a summary or download as a PDF uh the
transcript that M metav gives you and
 
transcript that M metav gives you and
it's not only uh about um interviewing
 
it's not only uh about um interviewing
candidates we also use it for intake
 
candidates we also use it for intake
meetings or kickoffs of course. So in
 
meetings or kickoffs of course. So in
that case what I would do is uh once I'm
 
that case what I would do is uh once I'm
done with my with my kickoff meetings I
 
done with my with my kickoff meetings I
would download of course the PDF and
 
would download of course the PDF and
then I would go to the tool that I'm
 
then I would go to the tool that I'm
going to show you today which is called
 
going to show you today which is called
Dust. Um I think there are more and more
 
Dust. Um I think there are more and more
of these tools of the market but Dust
 
of these tools of the market but Dust
are our partners on everything related
 
are our partners on everything related
to AI agents. So what we decided to do
 
to AI agents. So what we decided to do
at Contour is to have different
 
at Contour is to have different
champions in different teams and
 
champions in different teams and
departments create autonomously um AI
 
departments create autonomously um AI
agents for the whole team to use. If I
 
agents for the whole team to use. If I
click on people here, I can see that the
 
click on people here, I can see that the
people team, so the HR team at Conto has
 
people team, so the HR team at Conto has
a lot of them. Uh and of course talent
 
a lot of them. Uh and of course talent
acquisition included. Uh one that's
 
acquisition included. Uh one that's
pretty cool that I wanted to show you
 
pretty cool that I wanted to show you
for example is called job ad. So as you
 
for example is called job ad. So as you
can guess it's our tool to craft uh the
 
can guess it's our tool to craft uh the
best possible job descriptions when we
 
best possible job descriptions when we
are launching a job. Um and of course
 
are launching a job. Um and of course
for that you need to provide it with
 
for that you need to provide it with
data. So I can just call it as I would
 
data. So I can just call it as I would
as I would call the GPT let's say uh
 
as I would call the GPT let's say uh
because actually these agents of course
 
because actually these agents of course
you can plug them on either GPT code or
 
you can plug them on either GPT code or
your usual LLMs. It will describe uh of
 
your usual LLMs. It will describe uh of
course the type of task it can do for
 
course the type of task it can do for
you and it will ask for more details. So
 
you and it will ask for more details. So
in this case uh I will answer I want
 
in this case uh I will answer I want
task one uh to craft a job description.
 
task one uh to craft a job description.
So the tool will ask me for uh a lot of
 
So the tool will ask me for uh a lot of
questions that you will see on okay
 
questions that you will see on okay
could be what's the role about who's the
 
could be what's the role about who's the
manager what is the context which is as
 
manager what is the context which is as
you can guess exactly what you discuss
 
you can guess exactly what you discuss
uh in your kickoff meeting. We've also
 
uh in your kickoff meeting. We've also
prompted it so that it ask the right
 
prompted it so that it ask the right
format of course of what we put in our
 
format of course of what we put in our
notion pages and and on meta view. So
 
notion pages and and on meta view. So
here I can say okay I want to upload a
 
here I can say okay I want to upload a
file I want to go uh here Sammy while
 
file I want to go uh here Sammy while
you're doing this do you mind if I just
 
you're doing this do you mind if I just
ask a question I think that will help.
 
ask a question I think that will help.
So who um created the um uh the
 
So who um created the um uh the
essentially the the the the responses
 
essentially the the the the responses
that this job ad bot provides. I did is
 
that this job ad bot provides. I did is
it you who literally designed this this
 
it you who literally designed this this
GPC? Yeah. Um, one one thing that was
 
GPC? Yeah. Um, one one thing that was
key for us and why we like Dust as a
 
key for us and why we like Dust as a
partner for now in terms of AI agents is
 
partner for now in terms of AI agents is
that they really um, so their value
 
that they really um, so their value
proposition is that you can go in the
 
proposition is that you can go in the
back office, I would say, of the agents
 
back office, I would say, of the agents
and create one yourself simply by
 
and create one yourself simply by
prompting. Uh, which means you don't
 
prompting. Uh, which means you don't
have to be a tech, you don't have to
 
have to be a tech, you don't have to
code anything. So in a case like this
 
code anything. So in a case like this
indeed, uh, if it's a relatively simple
 
indeed, uh, if it's a relatively simple
bot, I could do one in like not even an
 
bot, I could do one in like not even an
afternoon to be honest. And sometimes of
 
afternoon to be honest. And sometimes of
course we had to uh revamp it a bit to
 
course we had to uh revamp it a bit to
uh to pimp it a bit after a few
 
uh to pimp it a bit after a few
feedback. But honestly any member of a
 
feedback. But honestly any member of a
TA team, ops team, whatever the team uh
 
TA team, ops team, whatever the team uh
could craft one super easily. Uh and so
 
could craft one super easily. Uh and so
you really have to prompt it literally
 
you really have to prompt it literally
saying okay when you're um when you are
 
saying okay when you're um when you are
called by a user, this is what I want
 
called by a user, this is what I want
you to ask the user, they should provide
 
you to ask the user, they should provide
this in in notes format, in PDF format
 
this in in notes format, in PDF format
or whatever. And so it will really uh
 
or whatever. And so it will really uh
really help the buttons. And and Samia,
 
really help the buttons. And and Samia,
I'm just gonna do a little bit more
 
I'm just gonna do a little bit more
explanation just so again for people of
 
explanation just so again for people of
differing levels can can sort of put
 
differing levels can can sort of put
this in context. So Dust is dust.t
 
this in context. So Dust is dust.t
super legit awesome AI startup. I think
 
super legit awesome AI startup. I think
they got funded by I'm fairly sure I
 
they got funded by I'm fairly sure I
know Sequoia investors on their board.
 
know Sequoia investors on their board.
So I'm I'm fairly sure they're Sequoia
 
So I'm I'm fairly sure they're Sequoia
funded startup based in France as well.
 
funded startup based in France as well.
Same as you Sammy. Um and you can think
 
Same as you Sammy. Um and you can think
of them as sort of a little bit like if
 
of them as sort of a little bit like if
you've ever tried with chat GPT to go
 
you've ever tried with chat GPT to go
and build your own custom GPT. um that's
 
and build your own custom GPT. um that's
a little bit of a consumerfocused
 
a little bit of a consumerfocused
experience. Dust is like that and I'm
 
experience. Dust is like that and I'm
sure has a bunch more to it, but very
 
sure has a bunch more to it, but very
much focused on the B2B use case. So
 
much focused on the B2B use case. So
that people like in Sammy's position or
 
that people like in Sammy's position or
if you're a recruiting leader or a
 
if you're a recruiting leader or a
recops person in in a in a function and
 
recops person in in a in a function and
you want to build something specifically
 
you want to build something specifically
with, you know, your organization in
 
with, you know, your organization in
mind and the ability to distribute it to
 
mind and the ability to distribute it to
other people in your organization and
 
other people in your organization and
maybe even create expectations that
 
maybe even create expectations that
people use these bots in certain
 
people use these bots in certain
instances. Dust is much better at that
 
instances. Dust is much better at that
than like a consumer product like chat
 
than like a consumer product like chat
GBT. So that's what uh yeah as part of
 
GBT. So that's what uh yeah as part of
this obviously Sammy is going to take
 
this obviously Sammy is going to take
you through the rest of the flow and
 
you through the rest of the flow and
you'll see how it works but you should
 
you'll see how it works but you should
probably also just go and check
 
probably also just go and check
something like that out as well and and
 
something like that out as well and and
build up your intuition there. Exactly.
 
build up your intuition there. Exactly.
Exactly. Um and for us indeed the main
 
Exactly. Um and for us indeed the main
advantage is that as you mentioned if we
 
advantage is that as you mentioned if we
were to use GPT for example um it would
 
were to use GPT for example um it would
mean when I come back to GPT I would
 
mean when I come back to GPT I would
have to reprompt everything. I would
 
have to reprompt everything. I would
have to find a way to give the GPT
 
have to find a way to give the GPT
access to some data that I have maybe on
 
access to some data that I have maybe on
notion uh on Google calendar etc.
 
notion uh on Google calendar etc.
Whereas just is thought of as a
 
Whereas just is thought of as a
workspace for companies let's say. Um so
 
workspace for companies let's say. Um so
here as you see it asked a lot of
 
here as you see it asked a lot of
questions. I'm going to say okay here
 
questions. I'm going to say okay here
are my notes
 
are my notes
from my kickoff meeting in a PDF. I
 
from my kickoff meeting in a PDF. I
don't want to bother with more.
 
So that's this is a great example,
 
So that's this is a great example,
right, of how you have this bot who has
 
right, of how you have this bot who has
expectations of that, oh well, I need
 
expectations of that, oh well, I need
this information in order to create this
 
this information in order to create this
this uh generation for you. You haven't
 
this uh generation for you. You haven't
had to answer it in exactly the way that
 
had to answer it in exactly the way that
it it wanted, right? You've just said
 
it it wanted, right? You've just said
here, here's my metav view notes. You
 
here, here's my metav view notes. You
can you can figure out from here.
 
can you can figure out from here.
Exactly. And so it explains, of course,
 
Exactly. And so it explains, of course,
I need to do a comprehensive job ad on
 
I need to do a comprehensive job ad on
the format that was asked from me, etc.
 
the format that was asked from me, etc.
And this is a job ad that you can find
 
And this is a job ad that you can find
pretty much on our website. Uh and so it
 
pretty much on our website. Uh and so it
was uh the agent was prompted to
 
was uh the agent was prompted to
understand first of all the tone of
 
understand first of all the tone of
voice that we want in our job
 
voice that we want in our job
description at Konto to make it really
 
description at Konto to make it really
conto if I can say and also the the name
 
conto if I can say and also the the name
uh of the paragraphs the emojis that are
 
uh of the paragraphs the emojis that are
always the same. So it's really crafted
 
always the same. So it's really crafted
a job description that is as we expected
 
a job description that is as we expected
at KTO um in a matter of seconds whereas
 
at KTO um in a matter of seconds whereas
before of course I would have to try to
 
before of course I would have to try to
craft it based on an older one could
 
craft it based on an older one could
take a few hours etc.
 
take a few hours etc.
So this is the first example of how we
 
So this is the first example of how we
use it for generative let's say content.
 
use it for generative let's say content.
Uh and we do it as you can imagine for a
 
Uh and we do it as you can imagine for a
lot of content. Could be case studies
 
lot of content. Could be case studies
for candidates, could be job
 
for candidates, could be job
descriptions, could be a lot of stuff
 
descriptions, could be a lot of stuff
like this. Maybe I can go on a second
 
like this. Maybe I can go on a second
use case. Uh just to sort of for
 
use case. Uh just to sort of for
questions there is a a job post that
 
questions there is a a job post that
would typically take you I mean have you
 
would typically take you I mean have you
sort of sized up the time savings from
 
sort of sized up the time savings from
going from here's an intake meeting to a
 
going from here's an intake meeting to a
job post to what what used to happen?
 
job post to what what used to happen?
Yeah. So of course it's a bit um it's
 
Yeah. So of course it's a bit um it's
always a rough estimate I would say in
 
always a rough estimate I would say in
those cases because we were not you know
 
those cases because we were not you know
tracking everyone to see how much time
 
tracking everyone to see how much time
they took but uh from what we see in the
 
they took but uh from what we see in the
team it's more like uh basically from
 
team it's more like uh basically from
the kickoff to having all the material
 
the kickoff to having all the material
ready and the job at live on our website
 
ready and the job at live on our website
etc. it was taking like two three days
 
etc. it was taking like two three days
because you needed to craft it, have the
 
because you needed to craft it, have the
manager review it. Same for the case
 
manager review it. Same for the case
study, etc. to whereas now uh in the
 
study, etc. to whereas now uh in the
same day or in like maximum 24 hours, we
 
same day or in like maximum 24 hours, we
can have everything live after a kickoff
 
can have everything live after a kickoff
meeting. Yeah. So, Sammy, walk me
 
meeting. Yeah. So, Sammy, walk me
through what's on the back end of this
 
through what's on the back end of this
thing. So, how much how much material
 
thing. So, how much how much material
did you train the agent on? Yeah. Um, so
 
did you train the agent on? Yeah. Um, so
what I can do is indeed if I go back
 
what I can do is indeed if I go back
here, I can show you. So this is the
 
here, I can show you. So this is the
main space where you know people uh edit
 
main space where you know people uh edit
their agents, they create them etc. If I
 
their agents, they create them etc. If I
go here, I can pretty much edit as I
 
go here, I can pretty much edit as I
mentioned uh myself the the bots. So
 
mentioned uh myself the the bots. So
this is an example of of what we call
 
this is an example of of what we call
prompting. Basically explaining what I
 
prompting. Basically explaining what I
want the agent's behavior to be and how
 
want the agent's behavior to be and how
I want it to work. You can see it's very
 
I want it to work. You can see it's very
uh humanlike, meaning there's no code.
 
uh humanlike, meaning there's no code.
It's not nothing too complex in here.
 
It's not nothing too complex in here.
You just have to be exactly as with the
 
You just have to be exactly as with the
GBT super specific on what you want them
 
GBT super specific on what you want them
to uh to do or to ask. So in our case we
 
to uh to do or to ask. So in our case we
we said for example okay you are acting
 
we said for example okay you are acting
as an experienced recruiter you can
 
as an experienced recruiter you can
either craft a job description
 
either craft a job description
respecting contour standards and this is
 
respecting contour standards and this is
the format and we give all the details.
 
the format and we give all the details.
uh or you can have a second task which
 
uh or you can have a second task which
is basically uh to review an existing
 
is basically uh to review an existing
one because I can also upload a current
 
one because I can also upload a current
job ad and it will tell me this is not
 
job ad and it will tell me this is not
respecting what you want to do at conto
 
respecting what you want to do at conto
this is good this is missing whatever uh
 
this is good this is missing whatever uh
and we also fed it uh an example of a
 
and we also fed it uh an example of a
good job description that we're happy
 
good job description that we're happy
with so that it can uh base itself on it
 
with so that it can uh base itself on it
uh we gave it one here
 
uh we gave it one here
uh and we also gave if I go on uh tools
 
uh and we also gave if I go on uh tools
So you can see that here I can ask add
 
So you can see that here I can ask add
um types of answers or features that the
 
um types of answers or features that the
agent can have. You don't want them all
 
agent can have. You don't want them all
for all but it depend really on your use
 
for all but it depend really on your use
case. So it can generate files, data,
 
case. So it can generate files, data,
images, search the web, whatever. Um so
 
images, search the web, whatever. Um so
this is where I would uh I would input
 
this is where I would uh I would input
all of that and there's also knowledge
 
all of that and there's also knowledge
that I can add meaning I can go here and
 
that I can add meaning I can go here and
add a data source which could be a
 
add a data source which could be a
Google calendar or notion uh slack. So
 
Google calendar or notion uh slack. So
you can really uh add whatever is needed
 
you can really uh add whatever is needed
uh and not too uh too touchy of course
 
uh and not too uh too touchy of course
if you want to add it in your agent.
 
if you want to add it in your agent.
Yeah, that's um and just to your
 
Yeah, that's um and just to your
question and obviously I don't want to
 
question and obviously I don't want to
speak on Sammy's behalf on this but uh I
 
speak on Sammy's behalf on this but uh I
think um
 
think um
having just one source of what good
 
having just one source of what good
looks like. He had a very very detailed
 
looks like. He had a very very detailed
prompt there as well. So I think I
 
prompt there as well. So I think I
probably works out fine. But the other
 
probably works out fine. But the other
thing I'd say is you you want I would
 
thing I'd say is you you want I would
argue you want to like have a lower bar
 
argue you want to like have a lower bar
bar, right? You don't want to, hey, oh
 
bar, right? You don't want to, hey, oh
 I haven't got like 10 amazing
 
 I haven't got like 10 amazing
examples, therefore I can't build a bot.
 
examples, therefore I can't build a bot.
You one example is totally fine,
 
You one example is totally fine,
especially if you create the expectation
 
especially if you create the expectation
that this is to get you off a blank
 
that this is to get you off a blank
page. This is not this has to be the
 
page. This is not this has to be the
final thing. It's like this is now
 
final thing. It's like this is now
something that's like at least a B+. At
 
something that's like at least a B+. At
least maybe it's an A+, but at least
 
least maybe it's an A+, but at least
it's a B+. You can edit it from here.
 
it's a B+. You can edit it from here.
Um, which is like so much better than
 
Um, which is like so much better than
what used to happen, which was go from
 
what used to happen, which was go from
blank page from first principles, write
 
blank page from first principles, write
one all yourself, which just took, you
 
one all yourself, which just took, you
know, hours and hours.
 
know, hours and hours.
Yeah, that's that's the author versus
 
Yeah, that's that's the author versus
editor discussion we've had, Sy, and
 
editor discussion we've had, Sy, and
it's actually really that's helpful for
 
it's actually really that's helpful for
for me even because I've actually
 
for me even because I've actually
thought about building my own GPT and
 
thought about building my own GPT and
have basically been like, oh, I don't
 
have basically been like, oh, I don't
want to like go download all my LinkedIn
 
want to like go download all my LinkedIn
stuff. It's going to take forever. Well,
 
stuff. It's going to take forever. Well,
what what you're saying is is actually,
 
what what you're saying is is actually,
well, just start with one and it's going
 
well, just start with one and it's going
to come out already better than you
 
to come out already better than you
expect. And then just make a couple
 
expect. And then just make a couple
edits and you're already moving fast.
 
edits and you're already moving fast.
Exactly. Exactly. Uh I think the blank
 
Exactly. Exactly. Uh I think the blank
page thing is uh is very true both for
 
page thing is uh is very true both for
recruiters and hiring managers. To be
 
recruiters and hiring managers. To be
honest, it was exactly the same when we
 
honest, it was exactly the same when we
asked them to uh for example create a
 
asked them to uh for example create a
case study for the job they're hiring
 
case study for the job they're hiring
for. Even if you master the job, it's
 
for. Even if you master the job, it's
super hard to do a case study because
 
super hard to do a case study because
you have to project on what can I ask
 
you have to project on what can I ask
this person based on the seniority I
 
this person based on the seniority I
want and stuff like this. And so having
 
want and stuff like this. And so having
agents for that is super helpful for
 
agents for that is super helpful for
them as well because that it gives them
 
them as well because that it gives them
something that's like 85 90% great and
 
something that's like 85 90% great and
then they they just revamp what they
 
then they they just revamp what they
want to. Totally. All right. What's the
 
want to. Totally. All right. What's the
next uh what's the next use case? Yeah.
 
next uh what's the next use case? Yeah.
Uh for the second one I wanted something
 
Uh for the second one I wanted something
that was not really generating something
 
that was not really generating something
let's say not content at least because I
 
let's say not content at least because I
think it's uh it's funny to try to
 
think it's uh it's funny to try to
explore what else could be useful to a
 
explore what else could be useful to a
team. So we have created one called
 
team. So we have created one called
market intelligence. Uh for this we
 
market intelligence. Uh for this we
simply plugged it with the main websites
 
simply plugged it with the main websites
that could talk uh of companies we're
 
that could talk uh of companies we're
interested in hiring from. So it could
 
interested in hiring from. So it could
be sifted, could be LinkedIn, could be
 
be sifted, could be LinkedIn, could be
uh Madness which is in France, but
 
uh Madness which is in France, but
basically any website that is public or
 
basically any website that is public or
database that you want to search. And so
 
database that you want to search. And so
when I call this bot, it will tell me uh
 
when I call this bot, it will tell me uh
okay, what do you want to do? Are you
 
okay, what do you want to do? Are you
hiring for a role? Do you just want
 
hiring for a role? Do you just want
market information? And so I can try.
 
market information? And so I can try.
Let's see what it says. Uh I'm not
 
Let's see what it says. Uh I'm not
specifically hiring.
 
specifically hiring.
uh but tell me all you know about metav
 
uh but tell me all you know about metav
view and its organization
 
view and its organization
and so what it does is typically you
 
and so what it does is typically you
want uh I don't know you have a specific
 
want uh I don't know you have a specific
competitor you're interested in you have
 
competitor you're interested in you have
a company you want to check uh but you
 
a company you want to check uh but you
don't have to just scroll their LinkedIn
 
don't have to just scroll their LinkedIn
and try to find articles or whatever you
 
and try to find articles or whatever you
try with this agent
 
try with this agent
and so what it does is it browses the
 
and so what it does is it browses the
few sources I told you and it will it
 
few sources I told you and it will it
will tell you what it found basically
 
will tell you what it found basically
But you've limited the sources it's
 
But you've limited the sources it's
allowed to look at in the back end on
 
allowed to look at in the back end on
this for this bot. Is that right? Um so
 
this for this bot. Is that right? Um so
you can uh in the specific dust agents
 
you can uh in the specific dust agents
you can add the the tool or the feature
 
you can add the the tool or the feature
that I mentioned which is search the web
 
that I mentioned which is search the web
and in that case it will search
 
and in that case it will search
whatever. Um but there's also uh the
 
whatever. Um but there's also uh the
possibility to specifically add specific
 
possibility to specifically add specific
websites if you want them to for sure
 
websites if you want them to for sure
check them out. So in our in our case we
 
check them out. So in our in our case we
for sure added LinkedIn sifted all the
 
for sure added LinkedIn sifted all the
the main ones for our population let's
 
the main ones for our population let's
say. Okay. So that's one. So what's in
 
say. Okay. So that's one. So what's in
this case then what's the difference
 
this case then what's the difference
between me asking your people
 
between me asking your people
intelligence bot this and me asking like
 
intelligence bot this and me asking like
chat GBT with browser use uh w with
 
chat GBT with browser use uh w with
search to do it. So what we've done is
 
search to do it. So what we've done is
that uh and you will see hopefully when
 
that uh and you will see hopefully when
it answers because I think it's broading
 
it answers because I think it's broading
a lot of stuff. Um what we've done is
 
a lot of stuff. Um what we've done is
that we wanted um uh something that was
 
that we wanted um uh something that was
prompted for specifically hiring meaning
 
prompted for specifically hiring meaning
um we didn't want to have to come back
 
um we didn't want to have to come back
to it as we would on a GPT and to
 
to it as we would on a GPT and to
explain the context every time saying oh
 
explain the context every time saying oh
I'm a recruiter tell me about the top
 
I'm a recruiter tell me about the top
people in this company or whatever. uh
 
people in this company or whatever. uh
this agent uh in this case is by default
 
this agent uh in this case is by default
basically understand that you're you're
 
basically understand that you're you're
talking in a hiring context and that
 
talking in a hiring context and that
you're interested in um in basically the
 
you're interested in um in basically the
organization parts or the top people
 
organization parts or the top people
part executives part this type of stuff
 
part executives part this type of stuff
like if you think of if you think of
 
like if you think of if you think of
these as like both research tools if you
 
these as like both research tools if you
think of like just asking chat GP GBT
 
think of like just asking chat GP GBT
which has a research functionality or
 
which has a research functionality or
asking this researcher is essentially
 
asking this researcher is essentially
tuned to specifically be like HR
 
tuned to specifically be like HR
recruiting researcher and so when you
 
recruiting researcher and so when you
ask it to do research it's going to do
 
ask it to do research it's going to do
it with that lens and not any other
 
it with that lens and not any other
lens. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I've not
 
lens. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I've not
prompted it probably some other teams
 
prompted it probably some other teams
that KTO have but I haven't pro prompted
 
that KTO have but I haven't pro prompted
it for example to be a strategy team uh
 
it for example to be a strategy team uh
you know agent which would uh tell me
 
you know agent which would uh tell me
about the revenue of a company or
 
about the revenue of a company or
something. Uh it's more really uh yeah
 
something. Uh it's more really uh yeah
to to find this type of information.
 
to to find this type of information.
Interesting. And Sammy what about what
 
Interesting. And Sammy what about what
about like you know LinkedIn recruiter?
 
about like you know LinkedIn recruiter?
So, is it only able to use the publicly
 
So, is it only able to use the publicly
available LinkedIn or is it able to like
 
available LinkedIn or is it able to like
go in through your account? Like, how
 
go in through your account? Like, how
does that work? So, what we've seen that
 
does that work? So, what we've seen that
it's able to do is to check for uh
 
it's able to do is to check for uh
LinkedIn profiles, meaning uh so here I
 
LinkedIn profiles, meaning uh so here I
have the answer. But if I was to ask it,
 
have the answer. But if I was to ask it,
oh, I want this person that you
 
oh, I want this person that you
mentioned LinkedIn, uh it can go and
 
mentioned LinkedIn, uh it can go and
retrieve it. So, it's able to search
 
retrieve it. So, it's able to search
probably via Google or something. It's
 
probably via Google or something. It's
able to search someone's name and find
 
able to search someone's name and find
their LinkedIn for you. What it cannot
 
their LinkedIn for you. What it cannot
do so far is to do advanced um search as
 
do so far is to do advanced um search as
you would on LinkedIn recruiter, meaning
 
you would on LinkedIn recruiter, meaning
filters and everything, which I'm pretty
 
filters and everything, which I'm pretty
sure is because uh LinkedIn doesn't open
 
sure is because uh LinkedIn doesn't open
their API for this kind of stuff. Uh so
 
their API for this kind of stuff. Uh so
they're quite closed. Uh but for the
 
they're quite closed. Uh but for the
rest, yeah, and um and so as you can
 
rest, yeah, and um and so as you can
see, it detailed all it did. So it it
 
see, it detailed all it did. So it it
looked for a lot of stuff and it gives
 
looked for a lot of stuff and it gives
basically an overview of okay, they're
 
basically an overview of okay, they're
London based, they're an AI technology
 
London based, they're an AI technology
company, etc. Uh here is the leadership
 
company, etc. Uh here is the leadership
team.
 
team.
with a little bio. So it it tells it it
 
with a little bio. So it it tells it it
tell gives the the bio of the key
 
tell gives the the bio of the key
people. Let's say here are the people
 
people. Let's say here are the people
that it found most likely on LinkedIn in
 
that it found most likely on LinkedIn in
the sales and marketing team at Metaview
 
the sales and marketing team at Metaview
in the product team in operations. Uh
 
in the product team in operations. Uh
here's what it found about recent growth
 
here's what it found about recent growth
and funding. So you can check if it's
 
and funding. So you can check if it's
hallucinating or if it's true. Uh here
 
hallucinating or if it's true. Uh here
is the main product and technology that
 
is the main product and technology that
the company does which is AI notes,
 
the company does which is AI notes,
integrations, nodes, scorecards, etc.
 
integrations, nodes, scorecards, etc.
culture and value. So basically it gave
 
culture and value. So basically it gave
me like um exact summary or rundown of a
 
me like um exact summary or rundown of a
company and then of course it gives me
 
company and then of course it gives me
the sources meaning the articles that
 
the sources meaning the articles that
they found on unleash on their your own
 
they found on unleash on their your own
website etc. And here of course I could
 
website etc. And here of course I could
discuss with it saying oh I'm interested
 
discuss with it saying oh I'm interested
in the growth team can you tell me who
 
in the growth team can you tell me who
is this person? Do they have a chief
 
is this person? Do they have a chief
growth officer? What is their LinkedIn
 
growth officer? What is their LinkedIn
and so on? Interesting s how how
 
and so on? Interesting s how how
accurate was that? Ah well um very very
 
accurate was that? Ah well um very very
accurate based but I I do think
 
accurate based but I I do think
unfortunately based on in some cases
 
unfortunately based on in some cases
some out of date information but uh
 
some out of date information but uh
that's which is what you would expect.
 
that's which is what you would expect.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um but I can confirm I
 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um but I can confirm I
am one of the leaders of the company and
 
am one of the leaders of the company and
it got
 
it got
this didn't change.
 
this didn't change.
Um, and it actually I think it's I think
 
Um, and it actually I think it's I think
like um it's probably actually it is
 
like um it's probably actually it is
actually a good thing to noodle on the
 
actually a good thing to noodle on the
accuracy because uh it is obviously one
 
accuracy because uh it is obviously one
of the things that I'm sure this would
 
of the things that I'm sure this would
be the case in the culture at KTO and
 
be the case in the culture at KTO and
using AI like an understanding that
 
using AI like an understanding that
these things aren't 100% correct. Like
 
these things aren't 100% correct. Like
you expect to go to certain tools and
 
you expect to go to certain tools and
have 100% correct. You shouldn't expect
 
have 100% correct. You shouldn't expect
that with some of these things like it
 
that with some of these things like it
did have some people listed as employees
 
did have some people listed as employees
who uh we may well be on their LinkedIn
 
who uh we may well be on their LinkedIn
uh as like one of the profiles but they
 
uh as like one of the profiles but they
are not actually employees of the
 
are not actually employees of the
company. um uh and this sort of thing.
 
company. um uh and this sort of thing.
So like that's like an interesting thing
 
So like that's like an interesting thing
to um you know a healthy dose of I don't
 
to um you know a healthy dose of I don't
want to say skepticism when using these
 
want to say skepticism when using these
things but like a a healthy dose that
 
things but like a a healthy dose that
you're not completely um um sort of
 
you're not completely um um sort of
abdicating responsibility for what
 
abdicating responsibility for what
you're going to do next with this
 
you're going to do next with this
information because you know this is
 
information because you know this is
this is again just like 80% there or
 
this is again just like 80% there or
something. It's expectation setting
 
something. It's expectation setting
right s right like you just have to set
 
right s right like you just have to set
your expectations appropriately. Like
 
your expectations appropriately. Like
the other expectation that I was
 
the other expectation that I was
thinking about when Sammy was doing it
 
thinking about when Sammy was doing it
was like how long we just waited, right?
 
was like how long we just waited, right?
So we waited like something like, you
 
So we waited like something like, you
know, 3 to 5 minutes or something like
 
know, 3 to 5 minutes or something like
that. And I was thinking about it, I'm
 
that. And I was thinking about it, I'm
like, "Oh, I'm kind of annoyed right
 
like, "Oh, I'm kind of annoyed right
now." But what would I be doing
 
now." But what would I be doing
otherwise would be going through like 10
 
otherwise would be going through like 10
articles and I'd be down the rabbit hole
 
articles and I'd be down the rabbit hole
for probably 15 to 20 minutes because
 
for probably 15 to 20 minutes because
that's how long it usually takes me.
 
that's how long it usually takes me.
True. True. Although I would um I think
 
True. True. Although I would um I think
there's a world where actually for this
 
there's a world where actually for this
type of a task actually Sammy let's just
 
type of a task actually Sammy let's just
so can you you gave us one that's like
 
so can you you gave us one that's like
metive view specific partly because of
 
metive view specific partly because of
theness of this pod what is like what's
 
theness of this pod what is like what's
the archetypal request who who would be
 
the archetypal request who who would be
using this bot in organization and what
 
using this bot in organization and what
would they be asking it would be mainly
 
would they be asking it would be mainly
used of course by the talent acquisition
 
used of course by the talent acquisition
team a lot for this bot maybe other
 
team a lot for this bot maybe other
teams have their own uh the typical
 
teams have their own uh the typical
request would be I don't know um we are
 
request would be I don't know um we are
reorganizing a team At Konto, we are
 
reorganizing a team At Konto, we are
launching a few key hires, head of
 
launching a few key hires, head of
something, director of something. Okay,
 
something, director of something. Okay,
can you uh give me uh information about
 
can you uh give me uh information about
the growth organizations in the top
 
the growth organizations in the top
European fintech? And then it could ask
 
European fintech? And then it could ask
you, okay, uh can you give me some
 
you, okay, uh can you give me some
details on what you would consider top?
 
details on what you would consider top?
I would say Revolute, N26, whatever. And
 
I would say Revolute, N26, whatever. And
then I would iterate and discuss with
 
then I would iterate and discuss with
the bot to say, okay, tell me if there's
 
the bot to say, okay, tell me if there's
a chief growth officer in their company
 
a chief growth officer in their company
and who are the direct reports. And if I
 
and who are the direct reports. And if I
want to check that it's not
 
want to check that it's not
hallucinating as you mentioned okay
 
hallucinating as you mentioned okay
where did you find the information can
 
where did you find the information can
you link me to the LinkedIn of the
 
you link me to the LinkedIn of the
article and it's pretty good at finding
 
article and it's pretty good at finding
especially the more uh the bigger the
 
especially the more uh the bigger the
company the more content there is online
 
company the more content there is online
it will be pretty good at identifying at
 
it will be pretty good at identifying at
least key people. Yeah, the what I was
 
least key people. Yeah, the what I was
so I think that makes a ton of sense.
 
so I think that makes a ton of sense.
What I was going to come back to on you
 
What I was going to come back to on you
Nolan was this idea that um okay you you
 
Nolan was this idea that um okay you you
can look at that that frustrating 3 to 5
 
can look at that that frustrating 3 to 5
minute wait as like oh yeah but I would
 
minute wait as like oh yeah but I would
have taken 3 to 5 hours um instead I
 
have taken 3 to 5 hours um instead I
think the main difference actually
 
think the main difference actually
should be we probably shouldn't be
 
should be we probably shouldn't be
sitting here watch it for 3 to 5 minutes
 
sitting here watch it for 3 to 5 minutes
right you put together your request it
 
right you put together your request it
goes and does its research and actually
 
goes and does its research and actually
if it takes three to five hours that's
 
if it takes three to five hours that's
totally fine because it's parallelized
 
totally fine because it's parallelized
you can ask it to do five things at once
 
you can ask it to do five things at once
each takes five hours they're not
 
each takes five hours they're not
dependent on each other you what in the
 
dependent on each other you what in the
meantime also having like five
 
meantime also having like five
conversations with people or something
 
conversations with people or something
like this. Um, so actually it's less to
 
like this. Um, so actually it's less to
do with the speed which is another thing
 
do with the speed which is another thing
I think people have to get. I was
 
I think people have to get. I was
listening to a podcast with Sundar from
 
listening to a podcast with Sundar from
Alphabet earlier today and he was
 
Alphabet earlier today and he was
talking about how latency is really
 
talking about how latency is really
important but also in some cases it's
 
important but also in some cases it's
people need to get out of this habit of
 
people need to get out of this habit of
thinking latency is like the most
 
thinking latency is like the most
important thing. For some things it is
 
important thing. For some things it is
getting the answer really quickly but in
 
getting the answer really quickly but in
other cases it's like better answer
 
other cases it's like better answer
tomorrow on this is totally fine um
 
tomorrow on this is totally fine um
because it's not an urgent thing. It's
 
because it's not an urgent thing. It's
like quality is more important. Yeah,
 
like quality is more important. Yeah,
this is like the So, I've basically had
 
this is like the So, I've basically had
to rewire my brain to focus on singular
 
to rewire my brain to focus on singular
tasks versus multitasking. And now what
 
tasks versus multitasking. And now what
you're telling me s is actually no, no,
 
you're telling me s is actually no, no,
no. AI is like you need to be a great
 
no. AI is like you need to be a great
multitasker, right? You got to have the
 
multitasker, right? You got to have the
window here and then this thing over
 
window here and then this thing over
here and then this thing going over
 
here and then this thing going over
here. And so actually it enables
 
here. And so actually it enables
multitasking to be done much better than
 
multitasking to be done much better than
before. Yeah. Yeah. But but I think also
 
before. Yeah. Yeah. But but I think also
maybe the thing I'm saying is you should
 
maybe the thing I'm saying is you should
also accept there's some like set it and
 
also accept there's some like set it and
forget it about this like the reason
 
forget it about this like the reason
that this query took 3 to 5 minutes and
 
that this query took 3 to 5 minutes and
if you scroll up to the reasoning trail
 
if you scroll up to the reasoning trail
Sammy so the bit where it was you see
 
Sammy so the bit where it was you see
this other part of the UI this sort of
 
this other part of the UI this sort of
grayed out box here this is like not
 
grayed out box here this is like not
part of the generation in a way this is
 
part of the generation in a way this is
just the AI showing you how it got to
 
just the AI showing you how it got to
what where it landed and that's useful
 
what where it landed and that's useful
two things one is just actually you as a
 
two things one is just actually you as a
user building up your intuition over
 
user building up your intuition over
okay this is how this works, therefore I
 
okay this is how this works, therefore I
should maybe ask questions like this in
 
should maybe ask questions like this in
future. And like prompting is a
 
future. And like prompting is a
legitimate skill that people need to
 
legitimate skill that people need to
understand and this is useful to help
 
understand and this is useful to help
you understand how it's working. And
 
you understand how it's working. And
then the second thing it's useful for is
 
then the second thing it's useful for is
you might spot where it went wrong and
 
you might spot where it went wrong and
like then you so you can give it much
 
like then you so you can give it much
better instructions either next time or
 
better instructions either next time or
like as part of this collaboration. So
 
like as part of this collaboration. So
my point is all of the time this 3 to 5
 
my point is all of the time this 3 to 5
minutes you can sit there and watch over
 
minutes you can sit there and watch over
the shoulder of the AI as it's doing its
 
the shoulder of the AI as it's doing its
work and see is it doing it right or you
 
work and see is it doing it right or you
can just come back to it in like half an
 
can just come back to it in like half an
hour's time when you know it's going to
 
hour's time when you know it's going to
be finished. you can see what the output
 
be finished. you can see what the output
is. If you're happy with it, great.
 
is. If you're happy with it, great.
You've like had a nice lunch in the
 
You've like had a nice lunch in the
meantime. Um uh and if if you're not
 
meantime. Um uh and if if you're not
happy with it, you can still see how it
 
happy with it, you can still see how it
landed at this thing, so you can go and
 
landed at this thing, so you can go and
correct it. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah,
 
correct it. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah,
this is what we would typically do to be
 
this is what we would typically do to be
honest. And then, uh the cool thing is
 
honest. And then, uh the cool thing is
that you can of course extract it, share
 
that you can of course extract it, share
it with your TA team so that we we can
 
it with your TA team so that we we can
centralize as well the info we we we
 
centralize as well the info we we we
get. Awesome. Sammy, one of the things
 
get. Awesome. Sammy, one of the things
we uh I think I know I think I know
 
we uh I think I know I think I know
about Conto was that you folks had an AI
 
about Conto was that you folks had an AI
mandate quite a long time ago. Is that
 
mandate quite a long time ago. Is that
right? Uh yes. Yes. Can you share more
 
right? Uh yes. Yes. Can you share more
like a little whatever you can share
 
like a little whatever you can share
about the context of that? Feels like
 
about the context of that? Feels like
over the last month there's been a few
 
over the last month there's been a few
high-profile CEOs of companies who have
 
high-profile CEOs of companies who have
come out and said hey everyone in the
 
come out and said hey everyone in the
company you need to be using AI. I'm
 
company you need to be using AI. I'm
just curious is that the same type of
 
just curious is that the same type of
way it happened at KTO and just
 
way it happened at KTO and just
whatever. How how did it come through to
 
whatever. How how did it come through to
you? What was the messaging and like why
 
you? What was the messaging and like why
what was the what was the justification?
 
what was the what was the justification?
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
Um so I would say to to do it super uh
 
Um so I would say to to do it super uh
briefly let's say um we had indeed we
 
briefly let's say um we had indeed we
wanted to push for AI and to be more and
 
wanted to push for AI and to be more and
more AI enabled at least uh this was a
 
more AI enabled at least uh this was a
uh an initiative that was carried by our
 
uh an initiative that was carried by our
co-founders and uh so they mandated sort
 
co-founders and uh so they mandated sort
of our CTO uh who of course wanted to as
 
of our CTO uh who of course wanted to as
well what we decided was to uh have
 
well what we decided was to uh have
champions in different teams that are
 
champions in different teams that are
the ones that will be you know in our AI
 
the ones that will be you know in our AI
community with the specific Slack
 
community with the specific Slack
channel, sharing knowledge, building
 
channel, sharing knowledge, building
these agents on dust and stuff like
 
these agents on dust and stuff like
this. Uh but not to do a top down
 
this. Uh but not to do a top down
initiative because for us if you just
 
initiative because for us if you just
tell people uh management said you have
 
tell people uh management said you have
to use AI, they they won't get why and
 
to use AI, they they won't get why and
they won't do it honestly. So it was to
 
they won't do it honestly. So it was to
identify the tech friendly let's say
 
identify the tech friendly let's say
people who could do it. Uh it works
 
people who could do it. Uh it works
pretty well because uh I would say on a
 
pretty well because uh I would say on a
given week like 80 to 100% of the
 
given week like 80 to 100% of the
company uses at least one dust agent. So
 
company uses at least one dust agent. So
all teams honestly use it for their
 
all teams honestly use it for their
daily jobs. Um and in terms of hiring
 
daily jobs. Um and in terms of hiring
and what to expect. So it's interesting
 
and what to expect. So it's interesting
because we've started more and more
 
because we've started more and more
asking candidates in the hiring process
 
asking candidates in the hiring process
what their use of AI is. But I would say
 
what their use of AI is. But I would say
it's much more to uh not have the risk
 
it's much more to uh not have the risk
of hiring someone who would be AI
 
of hiring someone who would be AI
advert. let's say uh not not that we
 
advert. let's say uh not not that we
have something against it but it's more
 
have something against it but it's more
okay if you don't want to use AI
 
okay if you don't want to use AI
honestly don't come at Konto because we
 
honestly don't come at Konto because we
use it a ton and we believe it will
 
use it a ton and we believe it will
change a lot of stuff so it's more we
 
change a lot of stuff so it's more we
will never say oh it's okay we don't
 
will never say oh it's okay we don't
hire this person because they haven't
 
hire this person because they haven't
used extensively AI uh because most
 
used extensively AI uh because most
companies are not there we know not
 
companies are not there we know not
everyone can can be there but it's more
 
everyone can can be there but it's more
that they should be at least curious
 
that they should be at least curious
that they understand that it can help
 
that they understand that it can help
tried maybe a few things on their
 
tried maybe a few things on their
personal time even if it's just some GPT
 
personal time even if it's just some GPT
uh prompting but we we really started
 
uh prompting but we we really started
recently to log it into our feedback
 
recently to log it into our feedback
scores and uh you know our feedback
 
scores and uh you know our feedback
notes just asking a few questions on how
 
notes just asking a few questions on how
do you use AI what do you want to do uh
 
do you use AI what do you want to do uh
more if you could have more time or more
 
more if you could have more time or more
knowledge and stuff like this so I don't
 
knowledge and stuff like this so I don't
know if in the future we and other
 
know if in the future we and other
companies will be like okay it's
 
companies will be like okay it's
mandatory but I think since we're not
 
mandatory but I think since we're not
there yet we just expect people to be
 
there yet we just expect people to be
curious I would say as as the tools get
 
curious I would say as as the tools get
better you're definitely going to
 
better you're definitely going to
mandate it because this is obviously
 
mandate it because this is obviously
like the best way to get work done. And
 
like the best way to get work done. And
like Sammy, like this is super helpful
 
like Sammy, like this is super helpful
for me because it the the biggest
 
for me because it the the biggest
takeaway for me from this segment is
 
takeaway for me from this segment is
it's not that hard to actually like spin
 
it's not that hard to actually like spin
it up. Like it didn't take you that long
 
it up. Like it didn't take you that long
to spin it. You said an afternoon, it
 
to spin it. You said an afternoon, it
probably took a couple hours, right?
 
probably took a couple hours, right?
Like and that's the that's been the the
 
Like and that's the that's been the the
burden my it's like, "Oh my god, this is
 
burden my it's like, "Oh my god, this is
going to take me a week, you know? I
 
going to take me a week, you know? I
really need to like go block out and
 
really need to like go block out and
like go into my log cabin without like
 
like go into my log cabin without like
any interruptions and go like crank out
 
any interruptions and go like crank out
this GPT. And what you just showed me is
 
this GPT. And what you just showed me is
like no no we just took like one JD
 
like no no we just took like one JD
dropped it in there and like everything
 
dropped it in there and like everything
gets to at least 80 to 90% now and then
 
gets to at least 80 to 90% now and then
it takes me a few minutes. We're done.
 
it takes me a few minutes. We're done.
Yeah. And the great the great thing
 
Yeah. And the great the great thing
about people like Sammy for us actually
 
about people like Sammy for us actually
as a as a company building AI tooling
 
as a as a company building AI tooling
specifically in our case for recruiting
 
specifically in our case for recruiting
is you also get a ton of inspiration
 
is you also get a ton of inspiration
actually for roadmap. So the the flow
 
actually for roadmap. So the the flow
that Sammy took you through earlier with
 
that Sammy took you through earlier with
where you uploaded an intake call in
 
where you uploaded an intake call in
order to get a JD. Literally last week
 
order to get a JD. Literally last week
we've had this AI job post functionality
 
we've had this AI job post functionality
in Meta View for a while. But now as of
 
in Meta View for a while. But now as of
last I think Friday last week as soon as
 
last I think Friday last week as soon as
you have an intake call the number one
 
you have an intake call the number one
primary call to action button on an
 
primary call to action button on an
intake call is create a job post off of
 
intake call is create a job post off of
this. And so you're sort of even just
 
this. And so you're sort of even just
like removing a couple of the steps that
 
like removing a couple of the steps that
that that Sammy showed. You go from call
 
that that Sammy showed. You go from call
to job post instant click. And the way
 
to job post instant click. And the way
we learn this stuff, because hopefully
 
we learn this stuff, because hopefully
we'll see during the rest of this
 
we'll see during the rest of this
segment, there's so many the amazing
 
segment, there's so many the amazing
thing about AI is it's so flexible.
 
thing about AI is it's so flexible.
That's great. The bad thing about this
 
That's great. The bad thing about this
flexibility is you have like a thousand
 
flexibility is you have like a thousand
flowers blooming and like companies like
 
flowers blooming and like companies like
us have to figure out, well, which one
 
us have to figure out, well, which one
of these flowers do we really try and
 
of these flowers do we really try and
turn into like a big I don't know a
 
turn into like a big I don't know a
bigger flower or something. Um uh and so
 
bigger flower or something. Um uh and so
this is the one this is actually one of
 
this is the one this is actually one of
them that we did which was okay well
 
them that we did which was okay well
let's just go straight from intake call
 
let's just go straight from intake call
to hit a button have a job post. Um uh
 
to hit a button have a job post. Um uh
but we'll see there's like tons of other
 
but we'll see there's like tons of other
opportunities as well. Exactly. And I
 
opportunities as well. Exactly. And I
think in the future we we could probably
 
think in the future we we could probably
imagine something that's like a meta
 
imagine something that's like a meta
platform like a global platform maybe
 
platform like a global platform maybe
per type of function and for hiring it
 
per type of function and for hiring it
could be indeed a you had this this kind
 
could be indeed a you had this this kind
of call. So uh as you mentioned call to
 
of call. So uh as you mentioned call to
action for an intake could be create a
 
action for an intake could be create a
job description. If it's an interview it
 
job description. If it's an interview it
could be okay do you want to send this
 
could be okay do you want to send this
the transcript automatically to the
 
the transcript automatically to the
hiring manager associated. So, it could
 
hiring manager associated. So, it could
be a lot of stuff that we do manually
 
be a lot of stuff that we do manually
right now. Uh, but I'm sure we we won't
 
right now. Uh, but I'm sure we we won't
have to in the future. World's changing
 
have to in the future. World's changing
fast. Sammy, thanks so much for taking
 
fast. Sammy, thanks so much for taking
us to school today, man. No worries.
 
us to school today, man. No worries.
Thanks a lot again for for an
 
Thanks a lot again for for an
invitation.
 
invitation.
