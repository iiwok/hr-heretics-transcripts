# How to Actually Use AI Agents, With Samy Aumar of Qonto

## Transcript

 
Hey everyone, this week on Heretics,
we're sharing a special episode of 10X
Recruiting dedicated to demoing how
execs are actually using AI. Just a note
that for those listening to the podcast
who want to see the demo, you can find
the video version on the HR Heretic
Substack or YouTube page. What's up
everybody? Welcome back to another
episode of TEDx Recruiting brought to
you by Metaview. S, what's up man? It's
good to see you. Good to see you too,
man. What's up with you? Uh it's you
know it's another beautiful day here in
Salt Lake City. But today is actually an
exciting day sle because we are
launching a new series called How I AI.
When you brought this up I was like all
right like let's let's kind of run a
couple of these and see how it goes. And
it turns out that actually people
sharing their screen. I was blown away
with what I'm learning on how people are
actually using AI in their recruiting
workflows today. Meta View obviously an
AI product within the recruiting space.
you have tens of thousands of people
using the product, but I see every day
like quite a large variance between the
sort of the most sophisticated users of
AI and the least sophisticated. Now, the
more effort you're putting into
orchestrating the AI, the more you're
getting out of it. It's sort of people
need to see it to know, you almost need
to see some examples of it to start to
think about how you can match that up
against your workflow. So, I think this
is going to be great for people who are
looking to futureroof themselves, start
to really build up intuition for how to
bring AI into the center of your
workflow, not just like play with it on
the margins. So Sammy Omar is at KTO and
we had an amazing conversation about how
he is actually using AI and again he's
showing his screen going under the hood
showing us how he built his workflows,
how much effort went into these things.
So what were your takeaways from our
conversation with Sam? AI mandates work.
They had an AI mandate sort of maybe
maybe about sort of six or so months
into our partnership with them. And the
fact is when you create an environment
in a company where hey the expectation
is you're working out how to use this to
give you leverage then these are the
results that you get. You can play the
role of the architect here. Now
obviously I look at some of these things
and I think there's a long tale of
workflows out there and you know you can
be the architect. You can be almost the
designer of these systems because
they're they're so intuitive to work
with. So I'd say that be my second one.
Okay. So I got two as well. The first
one for me is no engineers needed. The
story I was telling myself is that it's
going to take a week for me to set this
thing up. I don't have the time to do
it. Maybe there's going to be some
technical aspect here that's a little
bit overwhelming and causing some
anxiety in me. And it turns out none of
that is true. One of the ones he showed
us he built in an afternoon. He said I
actually toyed around after and I built
one in 15 minutes. Just start and toy
around with it. You're already at a much
better position than you were before you
started. This is not like some you don't
need to bring in your DevOps team or
your internal tools team to come help
you do this. You can do this on your own
being completely untechnical like me.
We're just about start that time where
you've got a bit of a free pass to try
things fail and mess up and so yeah I
think I totally agree like yeah
obviously just just get started. Yeah.
The second one for me is B minus outputs
beat blank pages. So this stuff isn't
perfect yet. People need to understand
that going in. I just like uploaded it
into chat GBT, had a conversation with
my custom GPT on this, got something
that was like a 85%ish sort of a thing.
Then I spent 15 minutes putting, you
know, the Nolan spin on it and it was
done. I got back to this customer in an
hour. That was never the case for any
job description I've ever worked on in
my career. It may not be perfect, but it
stimulates new ideas that you hadn't had
before and gets you there faster. So, I
love the idea of no longer starting with
a blank page and starting at like, you
know, you're like in the red zone about
to throw a touchdown. Sammy is a
recruiting operations person. And he is
setting this up so that he can actually
control the quality of output across his
company. So, what you don't probably
want actually if you're one of the
people in the, you know, trying to
orchestrate recruiting within your
company is just letting a thousand
flowers bloom and everyone has their own
interpretation of what a great JD is.
You can get you the sort of AI output up
to an A and A plus. And then you can
also say, and guess what? This is now
available to everyone in my company. So
that now there's no excuse for anyone
having a B minus output actually because
I've done this for you. Watch this
because like when you see it with your
own eyes, you will begin to believe Sil
and I when we tell you like the future
is here and it's not as crazy hard as
you think it is to implement it. So
without further ado, here is our episode
with Sammy from KTO. Hope you guys enjoy
it. This is 10X Recruiting, a podcast
from Metaview. Let's get after it.
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of 10X Recruiting. This
is a special episode, an AI focused
episode called How I AI in Recruiting,
which Sle gave me a great idea on a
couple weeks ago. And so we have Sammy
Omar here from KTO. Sammy, what's up,
man? Welcome to the show. Good, good. I
hope you're all well and uh thanks for
inviting me. Yeah, we're stoked to have
you. So S, what's what's the deal with
this idea? Like give people the rundown.
Yeah. Well, it's I think it's like
increasingly becoming the the real topic
of the day, which is less uh hey, how do
I experiment with AI, which used to be
what people were were sort of focused on
maybe for the last couple of years, and
now it's become much more how do I make
AI central to my workflow? And we know
we have some amazing Metav view
customers who have AI central to their
recruiting workflow, and we just wanted
to show and tell how to do it. Uh that
said, some of this is going to be new to
me, too. I'm going to learn a ton about
how people are using these things. Uh it
is a it is the I don't want to say it's
the wild west out there but it's a new
frontier so there should be surprising
things that we're all seeing and I think
the best way to learn is to sort of you
know show and tell. So that's what this
is about. Yeah. So I would describe this
as like a practitioners episode right
like if you are actually working in
recruiting this episode is for you. So
Sammy you're going to show your screen
and run us through how you use AI. So
please pop it up and give us the
rundown. Sure. Uh thanks a lot for for
the intro. I think I have two distinct
use cases that could give a some ideas
to uh our listeners and watchers. So I'm
going to share my screen um up like
this.
Okay, you should see my screen on a meta
view transcript. So this is not an ad
for metav view. We didn't consult before
on this. I I promise. Um but one first
thing of course that we do uh and the
first use case we wanted to track was
having AI uh quality transcripts of our
interviews. So I'm not going to do a
full demo of Metaview of course but I'm
just showing you that uh one of the cool
features is that you can of course copy
a summary or download as a PDF uh the
transcript that M metav gives you and
it's not only uh about um interviewing
candidates we also use it for intake
meetings or kickoffs of course. So in
that case what I would do is uh once I'm
done with my with my kickoff meetings I
would download of course the PDF and
then I would go to the tool that I'm
going to show you today which is called
Dust. Um I think there are more and more
of these tools of the market but Dust
are our partners on everything related
to AI agents. So what we decided to do
at Contour is to have different
champions in different teams and
departments create autonomously um AI
agents for the whole team to use. If I
click on people here, I can see that the
people team, so the HR team at Conto has
a lot of them. Uh and of course talent
acquisition included. Uh one that's
pretty cool that I wanted to show you
for example is called job ad. So as you
can guess it's our tool to craft uh the
best possible job descriptions when we
are launching a job. Um and of course
for that you need to provide it with
data. So I can just call it as I would
as I would call the GPT let's say uh
because actually these agents of course
you can plug them on either GPT code or
your usual LLMs. It will describe uh of
course the type of task it can do for
you and it will ask for more details. So
in this case uh I will answer I want
task one uh to craft a job description.
So the tool will ask me for uh a lot of
questions that you will see on okay
could be what's the role about who's the
manager what is the context which is as
you can guess exactly what you discuss
uh in your kickoff meeting. We've also
prompted it so that it ask the right
format of course of what we put in our
notion pages and and on meta view. So
here I can say okay I want to upload a
file I want to go uh here Sammy while
you're doing this do you mind if I just
ask a question I think that will help.
So who um created the um uh the
essentially the the the the responses
that this job ad bot provides. I did is
it you who literally designed this this
GPC? Yeah. Um, one one thing that was
key for us and why we like Dust as a
partner for now in terms of AI agents is
that they really um, so their value
proposition is that you can go in the
back office, I would say, of the agents
and create one yourself simply by
prompting. Uh, which means you don't
have to be a tech, you don't have to
code anything. So in a case like this
indeed, uh, if it's a relatively simple
bot, I could do one in like not even an
afternoon to be honest. And sometimes of
course we had to uh revamp it a bit to
uh to pimp it a bit after a few
feedback. But honestly any member of a
TA team, ops team, whatever the team uh
could craft one super easily. Uh and so
you really have to prompt it literally
saying okay when you're um when you are
called by a user, this is what I want
you to ask the user, they should provide
this in in notes format, in PDF format
or whatever. And so it will really uh
really help the buttons. And and Samia,
I'm just gonna do a little bit more
explanation just so again for people of
differing levels can can sort of put
this in context. So Dust is dust.t
super legit awesome AI startup. I think
they got funded by I'm fairly sure I
know Sequoia investors on their board.
So I'm I'm fairly sure they're Sequoia
funded startup based in France as well.
Same as you Sammy. Um and you can think
of them as sort of a little bit like if
you've ever tried with chat GPT to go
and build your own custom GPT. um that's
a little bit of a consumerfocused
experience. Dust is like that and I'm
sure has a bunch more to it, but very
much focused on the B2B use case. So
that people like in Sammy's position or
if you're a recruiting leader or a
recops person in in a in a function and
you want to build something specifically
with, you know, your organization in
mind and the ability to distribute it to
other people in your organization and
maybe even create expectations that
people use these bots in certain
instances. Dust is much better at that
than like a consumer product like chat
GBT. So that's what uh yeah as part of
this obviously Sammy is going to take
you through the rest of the flow and
you'll see how it works but you should
probably also just go and check
something like that out as well and and
build up your intuition there. Exactly.
Exactly. Um and for us indeed the main
advantage is that as you mentioned if we
were to use GPT for example um it would
mean when I come back to GPT I would
have to reprompt everything. I would
have to find a way to give the GPT
access to some data that I have maybe on
notion uh on Google calendar etc.
Whereas just is thought of as a
workspace for companies let's say. Um so
here as you see it asked a lot of
questions. I'm going to say okay here
are my notes
from my kickoff meeting in a PDF. I
don't want to bother with more.
 
So that's this is a great example,
right, of how you have this bot who has
expectations of that, oh well, I need
this information in order to create this
this uh generation for you. You haven't
had to answer it in exactly the way that
it it wanted, right? You've just said
here, here's my metav view notes. You
can you can figure out from here.
Exactly. And so it explains, of course,
I need to do a comprehensive job ad on
the format that was asked from me, etc.
And this is a job ad that you can find
pretty much on our website. Uh and so it
was uh the agent was prompted to
understand first of all the tone of
voice that we want in our job
description at Konto to make it really
conto if I can say and also the the name
uh of the paragraphs the emojis that are
always the same. So it's really crafted
a job description that is as we expected
at KTO um in a matter of seconds whereas
before of course I would have to try to
craft it based on an older one could
take a few hours etc.
So this is the first example of how we
use it for generative let's say content.
Uh and we do it as you can imagine for a
lot of content. Could be case studies
for candidates, could be job
descriptions, could be a lot of stuff
like this. Maybe I can go on a second
use case. Uh just to sort of for
questions there is a a job post that
would typically take you I mean have you
sort of sized up the time savings from
going from here's an intake meeting to a
job post to what what used to happen?
Yeah. So of course it's a bit um it's
always a rough estimate I would say in
those cases because we were not you know
tracking everyone to see how much time
they took but uh from what we see in the
team it's more like uh basically from
the kickoff to having all the material
ready and the job at live on our website
etc. it was taking like two three days
because you needed to craft it, have the
manager review it. Same for the case
study, etc. to whereas now uh in the
same day or in like maximum 24 hours, we
can have everything live after a kickoff
meeting. Yeah. So, Sammy, walk me
through what's on the back end of this
thing. So, how much how much material
did you train the agent on? Yeah. Um, so
what I can do is indeed if I go back
here, I can show you. So this is the
main space where you know people uh edit
their agents, they create them etc. If I
go here, I can pretty much edit as I
mentioned uh myself the the bots. So
this is an example of of what we call
prompting. Basically explaining what I
want the agent's behavior to be and how
I want it to work. You can see it's very
uh humanlike, meaning there's no code.
It's not nothing too complex in here.
You just have to be exactly as with the
GBT super specific on what you want them
to uh to do or to ask. So in our case we
we said for example okay you are acting
as an experienced recruiter you can
either craft a job description
respecting contour standards and this is
the format and we give all the details.
uh or you can have a second task which
is basically uh to review an existing
one because I can also upload a current
job ad and it will tell me this is not
respecting what you want to do at conto
this is good this is missing whatever uh
and we also fed it uh an example of a
good job description that we're happy
with so that it can uh base itself on it
uh we gave it one here
uh and we also gave if I go on uh tools
So you can see that here I can ask add
um types of answers or features that the
agent can have. You don't want them all
for all but it depend really on your use
case. So it can generate files, data,
images, search the web, whatever. Um so
this is where I would uh I would input
all of that and there's also knowledge
that I can add meaning I can go here and
add a data source which could be a
Google calendar or notion uh slack. So
you can really uh add whatever is needed
uh and not too uh too touchy of course
if you want to add it in your agent.
Yeah, that's um and just to your
question and obviously I don't want to
speak on Sammy's behalf on this but uh I
think um
having just one source of what good
looks like. He had a very very detailed
prompt there as well. So I think I
probably works out fine. But the other
thing I'd say is you you want I would
argue you want to like have a lower bar
bar, right? You don't want to, hey, oh
 I haven't got like 10 amazing
examples, therefore I can't build a bot.
You one example is totally fine,
especially if you create the expectation
that this is to get you off a blank
page. This is not this has to be the
final thing. It's like this is now
something that's like at least a B+. At
least maybe it's an A+, but at least
it's a B+. You can edit it from here.
Um, which is like so much better than
what used to happen, which was go from
blank page from first principles, write
one all yourself, which just took, you
know, hours and hours.
Yeah, that's that's the author versus
editor discussion we've had, Sy, and
it's actually really that's helpful for
for me even because I've actually
thought about building my own GPT and
have basically been like, oh, I don't
want to like go download all my LinkedIn
stuff. It's going to take forever. Well,
what what you're saying is is actually,
well, just start with one and it's going
to come out already better than you
expect. And then just make a couple
edits and you're already moving fast.
Exactly. Exactly. Uh I think the blank
page thing is uh is very true both for
recruiters and hiring managers. To be
honest, it was exactly the same when we
asked them to uh for example create a
case study for the job they're hiring
for. Even if you master the job, it's
super hard to do a case study because
you have to project on what can I ask
this person based on the seniority I
want and stuff like this. And so having
agents for that is super helpful for
them as well because that it gives them
something that's like 85 90% great and
then they they just revamp what they
want to. Totally. All right. What's the
next uh what's the next use case? Yeah.
Uh for the second one I wanted something
that was not really generating something
let's say not content at least because I
think it's uh it's funny to try to
explore what else could be useful to a
team. So we have created one called
market intelligence. Uh for this we
simply plugged it with the main websites
that could talk uh of companies we're
interested in hiring from. So it could
be sifted, could be LinkedIn, could be
uh Madness which is in France, but
basically any website that is public or
database that you want to search. And so
when I call this bot, it will tell me uh
okay, what do you want to do? Are you
hiring for a role? Do you just want
market information? And so I can try.
Let's see what it says. Uh I'm not
specifically hiring.
uh but tell me all you know about metav
view and its organization
and so what it does is typically you
want uh I don't know you have a specific
competitor you're interested in you have
a company you want to check uh but you
don't have to just scroll their LinkedIn
and try to find articles or whatever you
try with this agent
and so what it does is it browses the
few sources I told you and it will it
will tell you what it found basically
But you've limited the sources it's
allowed to look at in the back end on
this for this bot. Is that right? Um so
you can uh in the specific dust agents
you can add the the tool or the feature
that I mentioned which is search the web
and in that case it will search
whatever. Um but there's also uh the
possibility to specifically add specific
websites if you want them to for sure
check them out. So in our in our case we
for sure added LinkedIn sifted all the
the main ones for our population let's
say. Okay. So that's one. So what's in
this case then what's the difference
between me asking your people
intelligence bot this and me asking like
chat GBT with browser use uh w with
search to do it. So what we've done is
that uh and you will see hopefully when
it answers because I think it's broading
a lot of stuff. Um what we've done is
that we wanted um uh something that was
prompted for specifically hiring meaning
um we didn't want to have to come back
to it as we would on a GPT and to
explain the context every time saying oh
I'm a recruiter tell me about the top
people in this company or whatever. uh
this agent uh in this case is by default
basically understand that you're you're
talking in a hiring context and that
you're interested in um in basically the
organization parts or the top people
part executives part this type of stuff
like if you think of if you think of
these as like both research tools if you
think of like just asking chat GP GBT
which has a research functionality or
asking this researcher is essentially
tuned to specifically be like HR
recruiting researcher and so when you
ask it to do research it's going to do
it with that lens and not any other
lens. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I've not
prompted it probably some other teams
that KTO have but I haven't pro prompted
it for example to be a strategy team uh
you know agent which would uh tell me
about the revenue of a company or
something. Uh it's more really uh yeah
to to find this type of information.
Interesting. And Sammy what about what
about like you know LinkedIn recruiter?
So, is it only able to use the publicly
available LinkedIn or is it able to like
go in through your account? Like, how
does that work? So, what we've seen that
it's able to do is to check for uh
LinkedIn profiles, meaning uh so here I
have the answer. But if I was to ask it,
oh, I want this person that you
mentioned LinkedIn, uh it can go and
retrieve it. So, it's able to search
probably via Google or something. It's
able to search someone's name and find
their LinkedIn for you. What it cannot
do so far is to do advanced um search as
you would on LinkedIn recruiter, meaning
filters and everything, which I'm pretty
sure is because uh LinkedIn doesn't open
their API for this kind of stuff. Uh so
they're quite closed. Uh but for the
rest, yeah, and um and so as you can
see, it detailed all it did. So it it
looked for a lot of stuff and it gives
basically an overview of okay, they're
London based, they're an AI technology
company, etc. Uh here is the leadership
team.
with a little bio. So it it tells it it
tell gives the the bio of the key
people. Let's say here are the people
that it found most likely on LinkedIn in
the sales and marketing team at Metaview
in the product team in operations. Uh
here's what it found about recent growth
and funding. So you can check if it's
hallucinating or if it's true. Uh here
is the main product and technology that
the company does which is AI notes,
integrations, nodes, scorecards, etc.
culture and value. So basically it gave
me like um exact summary or rundown of a
company and then of course it gives me
the sources meaning the articles that
they found on unleash on their your own
website etc. And here of course I could
discuss with it saying oh I'm interested
in the growth team can you tell me who
is this person? Do they have a chief
growth officer? What is their LinkedIn
and so on? Interesting s how how
accurate was that? Ah well um very very
accurate based but I I do think
unfortunately based on in some cases
some out of date information but uh
that's which is what you would expect.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um but I can confirm I
am one of the leaders of the company and
it got
this didn't change.
Um, and it actually I think it's I think
like um it's probably actually it is
actually a good thing to noodle on the
accuracy because uh it is obviously one
of the things that I'm sure this would
be the case in the culture at KTO and
using AI like an understanding that
these things aren't 100% correct. Like
you expect to go to certain tools and
have 100% correct. You shouldn't expect
that with some of these things like it
did have some people listed as employees
who uh we may well be on their LinkedIn
uh as like one of the profiles but they
are not actually employees of the
company. um uh and this sort of thing.
So like that's like an interesting thing
to um you know a healthy dose of I don't
want to say skepticism when using these
things but like a a healthy dose that
you're not completely um um sort of
abdicating responsibility for what
you're going to do next with this
information because you know this is
this is again just like 80% there or
something. It's expectation setting
right s right like you just have to set
your expectations appropriately. Like
the other expectation that I was
thinking about when Sammy was doing it
was like how long we just waited, right?
So we waited like something like, you
know, 3 to 5 minutes or something like
that. And I was thinking about it, I'm
like, "Oh, I'm kind of annoyed right
now." But what would I be doing
otherwise would be going through like 10
articles and I'd be down the rabbit hole
for probably 15 to 20 minutes because
that's how long it usually takes me.
True. True. Although I would um I think
there's a world where actually for this
type of a task actually Sammy let's just
so can you you gave us one that's like
metive view specific partly because of
theness of this pod what is like what's
the archetypal request who who would be
using this bot in organization and what
would they be asking it would be mainly
used of course by the talent acquisition
team a lot for this bot maybe other
teams have their own uh the typical
request would be I don't know um we are
reorganizing a team At Konto, we are
launching a few key hires, head of
something, director of something. Okay,
can you uh give me uh information about
the growth organizations in the top
European fintech? And then it could ask
you, okay, uh can you give me some
details on what you would consider top?
I would say Revolute, N26, whatever. And
then I would iterate and discuss with
the bot to say, okay, tell me if there's
a chief growth officer in their company
and who are the direct reports. And if I
want to check that it's not
hallucinating as you mentioned okay
where did you find the information can
you link me to the LinkedIn of the
article and it's pretty good at finding
especially the more uh the bigger the
company the more content there is online
it will be pretty good at identifying at
least key people. Yeah, the what I was
so I think that makes a ton of sense.
What I was going to come back to on you
Nolan was this idea that um okay you you
can look at that that frustrating 3 to 5
minute wait as like oh yeah but I would
have taken 3 to 5 hours um instead I
think the main difference actually
should be we probably shouldn't be
sitting here watch it for 3 to 5 minutes
right you put together your request it
goes and does its research and actually
if it takes three to five hours that's
totally fine because it's parallelized
you can ask it to do five things at once
each takes five hours they're not
dependent on each other you what in the
meantime also having like five
conversations with people or something
like this. Um, so actually it's less to
do with the speed which is another thing
I think people have to get. I was
listening to a podcast with Sundar from
Alphabet earlier today and he was
talking about how latency is really
important but also in some cases it's
people need to get out of this habit of
thinking latency is like the most
important thing. For some things it is
getting the answer really quickly but in
other cases it's like better answer
tomorrow on this is totally fine um
because it's not an urgent thing. It's
like quality is more important. Yeah,
this is like the So, I've basically had
to rewire my brain to focus on singular
tasks versus multitasking. And now what
you're telling me s is actually no, no,
no. AI is like you need to be a great
multitasker, right? You got to have the
window here and then this thing over
here and then this thing going over
here. And so actually it enables
multitasking to be done much better than
before. Yeah. Yeah. But but I think also
maybe the thing I'm saying is you should
also accept there's some like set it and
forget it about this like the reason
that this query took 3 to 5 minutes and
if you scroll up to the reasoning trail
Sammy so the bit where it was you see
this other part of the UI this sort of
grayed out box here this is like not
part of the generation in a way this is
just the AI showing you how it got to
what where it landed and that's useful
two things one is just actually you as a
user building up your intuition over
okay this is how this works, therefore I
should maybe ask questions like this in
future. And like prompting is a
legitimate skill that people need to
understand and this is useful to help
you understand how it's working. And
then the second thing it's useful for is
you might spot where it went wrong and
like then you so you can give it much
better instructions either next time or
like as part of this collaboration. So
my point is all of the time this 3 to 5
minutes you can sit there and watch over
the shoulder of the AI as it's doing its
work and see is it doing it right or you
can just come back to it in like half an
hour's time when you know it's going to
be finished. you can see what the output
is. If you're happy with it, great.
You've like had a nice lunch in the
meantime. Um uh and if if you're not
happy with it, you can still see how it
landed at this thing, so you can go and
correct it. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah,
this is what we would typically do to be
honest. And then, uh the cool thing is
that you can of course extract it, share
it with your TA team so that we we can
centralize as well the info we we we
get. Awesome. Sammy, one of the things
we uh I think I know I think I know
about Conto was that you folks had an AI
mandate quite a long time ago. Is that
right? Uh yes. Yes. Can you share more
like a little whatever you can share
about the context of that? Feels like
over the last month there's been a few
high-profile CEOs of companies who have
come out and said hey everyone in the
company you need to be using AI. I'm
just curious is that the same type of
way it happened at KTO and just
whatever. How how did it come through to
you? What was the messaging and like why
what was the what was the justification?
Yeah.
Um so I would say to to do it super uh
briefly let's say um we had indeed we
wanted to push for AI and to be more and
more AI enabled at least uh this was a
uh an initiative that was carried by our
co-founders and uh so they mandated sort
of our CTO uh who of course wanted to as
well what we decided was to uh have
champions in different teams that are
the ones that will be you know in our AI
community with the specific Slack
channel, sharing knowledge, building
these agents on dust and stuff like
this. Uh but not to do a top down
initiative because for us if you just
tell people uh management said you have
to use AI, they they won't get why and
they won't do it honestly. So it was to
identify the tech friendly let's say
people who could do it. Uh it works
pretty well because uh I would say on a
given week like 80 to 100% of the
company uses at least one dust agent. So
all teams honestly use it for their
daily jobs. Um and in terms of hiring
and what to expect. So it's interesting
because we've started more and more
asking candidates in the hiring process
what their use of AI is. But I would say
it's much more to uh not have the risk
of hiring someone who would be AI
advert. let's say uh not not that we
have something against it but it's more
okay if you don't want to use AI
honestly don't come at Konto because we
use it a ton and we believe it will
change a lot of stuff so it's more we
will never say oh it's okay we don't
hire this person because they haven't
used extensively AI uh because most
companies are not there we know not
everyone can can be there but it's more
that they should be at least curious
that they understand that it can help
tried maybe a few things on their
personal time even if it's just some GPT
uh prompting but we we really started
recently to log it into our feedback
scores and uh you know our feedback
notes just asking a few questions on how
do you use AI what do you want to do uh
more if you could have more time or more
knowledge and stuff like this so I don't
know if in the future we and other
companies will be like okay it's
mandatory but I think since we're not
there yet we just expect people to be
curious I would say as as the tools get
better you're definitely going to
mandate it because this is obviously
like the best way to get work done. And
like Sammy, like this is super helpful
for me because it the the biggest
takeaway for me from this segment is
it's not that hard to actually like spin
it up. Like it didn't take you that long
to spin it. You said an afternoon, it
probably took a couple hours, right?
Like and that's the that's been the the
burden my it's like, "Oh my god, this is
going to take me a week, you know? I
really need to like go block out and
like go into my log cabin without like
any interruptions and go like crank out
this GPT. And what you just showed me is
like no no we just took like one JD
dropped it in there and like everything
gets to at least 80 to 90% now and then
it takes me a few minutes. We're done.
Yeah. And the great the great thing
about people like Sammy for us actually
as a as a company building AI tooling
specifically in our case for recruiting
is you also get a ton of inspiration
actually for roadmap. So the the flow
that Sammy took you through earlier with
where you uploaded an intake call in
order to get a JD. Literally last week
we've had this AI job post functionality
in Meta View for a while. But now as of
last I think Friday last week as soon as
you have an intake call the number one
primary call to action button on an
intake call is create a job post off of
this. And so you're sort of even just
like removing a couple of the steps that
that that Sammy showed. You go from call
to job post instant click. And the way
we learn this stuff, because hopefully
we'll see during the rest of this
segment, there's so many the amazing
thing about AI is it's so flexible.
That's great. The bad thing about this
flexibility is you have like a thousand
flowers blooming and like companies like
us have to figure out, well, which one
of these flowers do we really try and
turn into like a big I don't know a
bigger flower or something. Um uh and so
this is the one this is actually one of
them that we did which was okay well
let's just go straight from intake call
to hit a button have a job post. Um uh
but we'll see there's like tons of other
opportunities as well. Exactly. And I
think in the future we we could probably
imagine something that's like a meta
platform like a global platform maybe
per type of function and for hiring it
could be indeed a you had this this kind
of call. So uh as you mentioned call to
action for an intake could be create a
job description. If it's an interview it
could be okay do you want to send this
the transcript automatically to the
hiring manager associated. So, it could
be a lot of stuff that we do manually
right now. Uh, but I'm sure we we won't
have to in the future. World's changing
fast. Sammy, thanks so much for taking
us to school today, man. No worries.
Thanks a lot again for for an
invitation.
