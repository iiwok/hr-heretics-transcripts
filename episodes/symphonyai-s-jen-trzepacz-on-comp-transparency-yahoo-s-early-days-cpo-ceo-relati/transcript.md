# SymphonyAI's Jen Trzepacz on Comp Transparency, Yahoo's Early Days, + CPO-CEO Relationships

## Transcript

 
it's been the only way I know is you
have to align your compensation strategy
to your talent strategy and your talent
strategy is aligned to your business
strategy and your business strategy is
going to have you know those areas of
indexing as to what's important to them
when you're managing 70% of the cost of
of the company you are going to get
squeezed and figuring out how can you be
more efficient what's the ROI on these
different levers that you have and
you're always just ifying and of course
a good CFO is always going to be asking
you to

justify welcome back to the HR Heretics
podcast where we get into the real talk
of company construction these are the
conversations that happened between
Founders Chief people officers and board
members behind closed doors we're
Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially as
it relates to people but on the show we
tell the truth and expect the same from
our guests today's episode is with Gen
trespass also known as JT so I've known
JT Nolan since since I started at Yahoo
which was I think 2006 or 2007 and she
was just kind of known as a badass um I
started off on the sales side and the HR
Group in a different building and JT's
reputation kind of preceded her to the
point where I was kind of like
intimidated you know I was 30 years old
I was trying to figure it out and she
was just had this awesome reputation
just business oriented just just a a
boss and then she went over to EA onto
Salesforce and then had stints at Living
Social lithium Technologies Rocket Fuel
and these were not easy gigs I mean
she's lived through the best and the
grind of it she then went to Wildcat
Ventures as an operating partner and now
she's back in the operating seat at
Symphony AI for the past two years and
it was just so great to connect with her
and talk about her journey yeah it's I'm
gonna try not to make a joke about you
looking at Yahoo in 2006 but beyond that
I found JT to be super real and just
like a a total badass like that's the
best way I can describe JT and why our
audience is going to love listening to
her I loved her takes on people Ops and
I also loved her takes specifically on
why Chief people officers would make
great CEOs yeah she's just she has such
a great Vibe and she can just lean into
hard stuff and also have a great Outlook
attitude about it all she's someone you
actually want to work with and talk with
second of all I'd love to hear about
Yahoo and 2006 you know there's a lot of
us that still bleed purple Nolan forever
so you better W you better watch out
better watch out with that one and JY
like I know a few of you guys and like I
can poke in PR because of the
relationship uh but I mean mean still
Yahoo like it's any AOL Yahoo's the best
always will Yahoo if if you have a Yahoo
email address by the way it's thought of
as a negative so like get a Gmail
anyways the new green circle the new
green circle I was thinking it said it
okay so put that on Kelly everybody
ultimately like you're exactly right not
only is she able to get into the real
stuff she's able to do it with this
affability this like very approachable
personality like we were cracking jok
the whole time and it seems that she has
that relationship with her current
executive team because apparently her
CFO was like walking across her office
like making faces at her while she was
on the podcast knowing that she was on
the podcast I think that says a lot
about who she is and the types of people
that she works but and then like six
minutes later just to stick with the six
Motif here she was like oh my legal
officer's walking by and making a face
in the window it's
great she's she's fantastic it's so good
so you guys are going to love this
episode uh please like share subscribe
share with your friends and enemies and
without further Ado here's JT JT thank
you so much for being with us today
we're so excited to dig in prod poke
pull you hear some good opinions hear
some good stories and just have some
real talk around this role so thank you
for joining us yeah I'm super excited to
be here thank you for having me so I JT
I want to dive in on mistakes Kelly and
I have we're going there already we're
going there right off the bat we
promised we promised our listeners okay
made a lot that's what they want to know
so let's talk about your biggest fuckups
or you know the ones that like you've
been a part of on the inside and things
that have gone wrong that you've learned
from this is the podcast that I wanted
to listen to at 28 when I started I wish
I had this podcast when I was younger
for sure uh and I was going oh my God I
had mess ups or fuckups uh um every
company like there's always a new one um
the the biggest one though that is
always going to be me memorable for me
is when I uh was working on the employee
Merit file and you know where this is
going right and uh I wanted to send it
to the executive team in Cambridge and
it said Cambridge Executives and instead
I sent it to Cambridge
everyone and so every body got the Merit
file of all the increases for the entire
company and it was not password
protected and not that time password
protection this is a while ago because I
am dating myself a little and that you
know when you type in something uh you
know you had a type in it like it does
populate but it was not that clear that
oh you need to send it to Executives
like you didn't have selection so anyway
I sent it to everybody I then realized
mistake my mistake was like oh no uhoh
uh so I reached out to my boss and I let
her know and uh said I well I understand
if you need to terminate me and uh I I
to totally totally take responsibility
for this careless error of not paying
attention and she said well um we were
thinking about being more transparent on
things you have definitely gone to the
extreme uh and we're going to have to
own this and uh we will you're going to
need to talk to the leaders and and on
this one so I called a leadership
meeting to apologize and uh but then
also talked about how this is a great
opportunity to really talk to people
about um equity and their value and
decisions and how the decisions were
made and creating more of an opportunity
to share how things get decided upon uh
they were not happy of course um with it
with it but they were
forgiving uh and everybody makes
mistakes right um and it was an innocent
mistake but it was a big oopsy right and
um I didn't get terminated I will never
ever send a file again without a
password protected and double-checking
and you know and all that kind of stuff
because you always have that one time
where you do that um and then uh you'll
learn from that and I've had something
happen recently with one of my and I was
like oh I went I was there when I was
your age and did that um JT were were
these the infamous uh Merit files of
Yahoo with the spawning and the spawning
and by the time you were done you had 50
files from one couldn't get them back
together yeah exactly well and and you
didn't have a good system and you know
so Tech has really helped with that too
where you have an application now that
you can do all the distribution of all
that stuff so yeah it wasn't at Yahoo uh
but it was it was a close second um I
I'll just say that uh and I just
remember those right oh yeah being so
young and my hands were like shaky and
you're pressing the button and you're
like I'm gonna do I'm gonna press the
button it's terrifying it it is
terrifying and and you are always
double-checking and I always remember
even when I have to send a an email that
could be a little contentious and every
I'm like okay I got to read over this
again and read over it again because
it's going to get forwarded someone's
going to interpret it you know if it
went into a lawyer's hands at some point
in time what does that how does that
look how so you're always being really
mindful of all the things that you got
to send out in particular from HR
because uh it's usually sensitive
information I have legit email anxiety
and that is like I think you just
actually increased my email anxiety
unfortunately um after that story that
is crazy it also those sounds like you
spun it incredibly well like that's
that's like marketing uh to the extreme
and so act like were you a were did the
company go more transparent with comp
after that mistake they did they did but
not to the degree that I um you know
initiated uh but there was a lot more
transparency there was a lot more
training I you know I have to I have to
give my manager credit because uh that
put her in a a situation where she had
to reveal that to um the uh the board
and uh and all that kind of stuff as
well and we luckily we were only in us
so we didn't have and we didn't have
gdpr at the time and you don't have to
report things relative to oh we just had
a security breach or a data breach on
your private information and all that
good stuff so I I think I was lucky um
today you know that the ramifications
can be a lot more um impactful and uh uh
there's a lot of legal ease and
compliance related stuff now that uh
especially on a global team that you
didn't have before but marketing is
really important transparency is really
important um you know I think that uh
you got to just look at the positive
intent behind it uh and and kind of make
lemonade out of lemons I mean the irony
is you through you know an error
accelerated what is actually table
stakes and it is expected today around
transparency it is it wasn't expected
then so was a little bit ahead of its
time um maybe on the sales side it would
be something that you would be more
transparent around because of the sales
comp and leaderboards and things of that
nature but not for an engineering
Centric organization uh that was uh yeah
that was a bit of a no no but um I I
have a tenden tendency to step into
these things where
transparency starts to become more uh or
directness becomes more of um a a topic
because of my mistake um so it's not
intended but I had this other example
where I was at Living Social uh and um
uh we um had a um a a software that we
purchased um our average age was 24 we
had 3,000 employees on a global basis
and I purchased a piece of tech that was
badging and badging was a new thing um
and it was for um you know peer-to-peer
recognition and and we got uh there was
an undercurrent of badging that was
going on in the company that was um
let's just say provocative badging that
people could potentially get now when
you're 24 years old um you know you're
the place to meet people is at work and
so there was kind of like a dating thing
um I'm probably gonna get this beeped
out but there was a the jazzle badge
there was the you know how many can you
you know execs can you do kind of thing
like it was and I had no idea I was
clueless I was like oh we got so much
engagement and bragging about all these
engagement metrics on this badging
system and then everyone's like you do
know what's going on and in the I was
like oh my god I didn't even know what
some of these badges meant um uh so um
uh yeah that got surfaced and um one is
that um for the transpar y piece was
that I was glad that somebody actually
gave me the heads up that this was going
on uh but it was more of the embracing
like that they were not only embracing
work but they were embracing having fun
and poking at each other granted it was
maybe a little sexual nature that we you
know there's an appropriate
inappropriateness here but that we were
able to have a dialogue around um
helping people be more mature and
professional as 24 year-old olds who are
just recently out of school and that
this is not school anymore um and uh and
so you know creating programs around
professionalism maturity code of conduct
and not code of conduct of like the
legal side just more of The Human Side
um about respectful workplace and all
that kind of stuff that uh kind of
transpired from that little snafu versus
being punitive which you you guys could
have been punitive you could have fired
people for that I love the approach of
like let's let's help these people
versus firing them and I I think so many
people lean into the oh we need to
terminate somebody versus actually could
this be a learning opportunity for them
and the rest of the company it's so
funny too I mean that that reputation
probably stuck with them right they're
 
experience with HR when they're 44 they
might have a great impression only
because of that 20 years prior yeah you
know what Kelly that's yeah I think
that's a that's great and I still get
pings from a lot of those
employees um and uh just about uh hey
we're now hiring ahead of HR are you
interested kind of thing uh like that so
there is some lasting memory around that
yeah these these reputations they they
stick with you especially if you kind of
run in the same circles I think half of
my advising gigs the past eight years
have been former baby employees you know
 
like I remember working with you can you
help us because you're the only HR
person we could stomach right so it's a
big deal it is I you know I didn't think
of it that way the ripple effect that
you have um in uh but it does come back
uh and hey um it was I think for
employees especially um in Venture uh
and in technology um there isn't uh you
there's there's a there's mixed reviews
on human resources and its Effectiveness
and the impact that it has and uh so to
make that difference I think is is
helpful because then it feeds and fuels
into the the the ecosystem eventually JT
you had mentioned transparency around
comp and I'm actually curious how you're
thinking around comp transparency today
at
Symphony WE Post uh the zero to
 
transparency all right I had to say that
because that's what everybody's doing
right now uh around that
um I think what what we're doing is
creating more transparency around our
methodology uh around our compensation
approach to things around our uh
composite or cohort that we're we're uh
measuring ourselves against um around
our philosophy on 50th percentile 6th
 
creating more transparency around the
process the methodologies the data
sources uh in order to educate managers
employees um we are not to the extent of
publishing salaries or sending out Merit
files uh the JT way um but uh um we're
also creating transparency with
compensation statements um that can help
with people understanding what their
full compensation package is for
themselves uh and get more educated
around that so that's been our
approach uh you know and in particular
we have to be careful because we are
very heavy European organization that
gdpr is a big component of that that we
have to be a compliant and mindful of
totally it seems like comp is a work in
progress everywhere like where do you
want to be as it relates to comp like
everyone's everyone's always like
working on it like where do you want to
be end state with comp I don't want to
be talking about it
anymore that's the end State like where
that's not what we're talking about um
and it is of course obviously the
biggest piece on the p&amp;l your headcount
is especially in Tech then there's your
benefits that is uh a big piece of it
your Equity comp is a big piece of that
so from a financial perspective uh we
have to be Mindful and deliberate and
diligent and strategic with all of these
um triggers and levers uh that make up
probably 70% of of um your your p&amp;l uh
so it is extremely important to have a
really good handle around um uh but yeah
it's it's one where I really just want
it to go away and when it goes away you
can focus on other things but when
people are not not feeling valued you
know that's when all the chatter and the
the complaints are coming and all that
kind of stuff and I I wish there was a
way we could make it all go away that's
called like being really rich and not
having to worry about any uh
shareholders or you know your next
earnings call and all that kind of stuff
um you know that's the ideal world but
uh I think that if we're able to get
them to feel valued in other ways then
the chatter stops around the comp um and
so you know focusing on some of those
things around your purpose your
relationship uh your flexibility the
things that are important to an
individual employee um figuring out
those levers and focusing on on those
outside of the comp piece can help with
you know stopping that chatter and being
transparent and just about where you
guys do pay and you know are you guys
are you talking to candidates about that
in the interview process and being clear
with candidates about where you pay from
a percentile standpoint um you know I'm
not sure if our our recruiting team goes
to that degree of
transparency um I do know that when
people get into the organization we do
pay uh we do share that type of
information just to be transparent we're
at the 50th percentile when it comes to
positions that are GNA oriented we pay
at the 65th per top for those positions
that are um uh of strategic nature to us
uh that's more around our product and
we'll pay at the 70th percentile for AI
oriented folks um and then at the sales
level we're going to pay at the 50th for
certain things but we're going to pay
Top Dollar on the sales commission side
so that and that's what triggers them to
you know do good work is is that they
have they can make money off their sales
comp plan so it it just depends on on um
you know your strategy and what you're
valuing and um and then what you can
afford hey everyone we'll be right back

market engineering and finance
challenges so check out Continuum in the
description below ping me on LinkedIn if
you have any questions or head to join
continuum.
comom JT a SP kind of a spicy question
on that just having lived in the seat
the last you know two and a half years
and driven a lot of change with comp
it's it's arguably easier to do that in
a great market right money is flowing
and our seats are kind of in the
intersection between the shareholders
the comp committee right the board the
employes have you felt squeezed and a
little bit tight as far as in this
market how have you handled that yeah I
mean that's when you have to make hard
trade-offs and you have to understand
like what is our real competitive
differentiation and we got to make sure
we have the best talent for that and uh
and it it really for us it all starts
with products so our product and
Engineering Talent is um is is by far
the value creation of this company and
and therefore we're always going to
fight for that and uh and then we have
to be creative with all the others um
when you have to make those hard
trade-offs so yes but I'm always feeling
pinched if it's not on the comp
philosophy around the base and bonus
it's about benefits uh or it is about
the equity um uh so you again you're
when you're managing 70% of the cost of
of the company you are going to get
squeezed and figuring out how can you be
more efficient what's the ROI on these
different levers that you have and um
you're always justifying and of course a
good CFO is always going to be asking
you to justify uh so yeah that's I think
that's actually business as usual it's
not actually spicy you've got to
tolerate that and you need to have
confidence and comfort in in always
leading through you know figuring out
what's best and the other thing is
finding out from the employees like what
is more important to you because I'm
going to have to Advocate and fight for
some of these things and I need to know
what those things are yep totally I love
the courage to not do the peanut butter
approach to say we pay it 60th
percentile across the entire company and
I love the indexing on the value
creators being the top of the food chain
as it relates to how much we pay I
actually don't think many companies do
that and I'm curious have you been doing
that for a while or is that is that a
new uh practice that you've instituted
uh uh it's been the only way I know is
you have to align your compensation
strategy to your talent strategy and
your Tal strategy is aligned to your
business strategy and your business
strategy um is going to have you know
those areas of indexing as to what's
important to them uh and it you know it
can even get to a point of uh you you
like at Venture AT inventure you know we
would say okay where do we spend our
time well we spend our time where we
have our biggest investment because
that's going to get us the high highest
Roi uh and you know even so the ones
that were at 1% ownership um they they
got the guide book they didn't get the
personal attention so you do have to
prioritize
um just just the way I've known is you
just got to prioritize based on what the
strategy is and the focus is for the
company there is nuance and that's okay
there is I love that yeah you have
argued that people leaders are great
candidates to become CEOs in the future
and that's not a very popular narrative
and Tech where Cen is soft and the
function rarely gets credit for you know
stuff that GMS get credit for can you
take us through that argument why you
feel like people leaders should be
CEOs oh yeah I feel very strongly about
that one um well you know as you know it
all starts with uh if you uh we have a
funnel that we have to manage to attract
people into the organization uh and we
have to create an employment brand so
there's 's being the CMO there is being
the chief Revenue officer and that we
have to manage our funnel and uh do
conversion of of folks that were
interested in in bringing into the
organization and then once they become
an employee you're now the chief
customer success officer where you need
to seed and grow that individual or that
account into something that is
blossoming and is uh utilizing that that
is being utilized and is utilizing all
of that's at their disp proposal and so
there is also so the chief customer
officer is another thing and then you've
got your Chief technology officer and
you have a tech stack that you have to
manage and you make your own technical
decisions and you're spending millions
of dollars on technology so you have to
deal with um you know that managing that
Tech stack and and the delivery to your
customer base which by the way you need
to have consumerism in the workplace uh
for an employee experience so all of
these apps need to be just like this you
know available on your mobile phone and
that you can click on the app and get
everything that you need and now we have
chat GPT as well so you need to have gen
AI into your platform of like now I just
need to type into my internet what's my
dental coverage and this says hi Jason
you know your dental coverage is
Guardian and you have blah blah blah
blah blah uh um so you know really
thinking through strategically as to
that employee experience and then as I
mentioned before the the um 70% of a
technology company's budget is based on
the decisions and the design that I'm
making around our compensation
philosophy um our our benefits
discussions that we're having on a
global basis and selecting those vendors
and what benefits we would have to offer
in our Equity design um and so those
that like who why would you not want to
pick somebody else but the head of HR uh
um now you need do need to have some
skills Beyond just like you know saying
oh that's transferable um like there's
strong business Acumen that you need to
have as well and and truly understanding
um uh the space that you're in or the
vertical you're in or that industry that
you're in uh to you know understand that
whole entire ecosystem but who would
know all of those things better than the
head of HR I think it's a great point I
I where do you think we are in that
Journey JT because straight up I don't
see a lot of them and I'm Wonder not
happening why why aren't why and maybe
said differently why aren't there more
Chi people officers that haven't
converted to
 
CEOs I wish I could answer that I mean I
I it's it's it's a legacy right um it's
it's a
undercurrent um it's uh just a
philosophy of of human resources that um
it's it's like a just a brand that's out
there uh that I think is really holding
it back you know when I talk to um
Executives Venture folks they're like
not for you JT but for everybody else
right you know and it's like no
everybody else is actually capable of
doing these things um but there is
definitely um I guess a
tarnished um assumption around human
resources and I was actually inter a
candidate for a a very senior position
and I was talking to them about how um
his strategy I felt was um it was very
Services oriented which is fine for
Value creation and growth but I mean
fine for growth but not for Value
creation because multiples on um uh the
value would be lower because Services
revenue is not as valued as a software
Revenue I mean this is basic 101 stuff
that uh you know HR folks should know um
but but he's like uh I've never had a
conversation like this with a head of HR
I thought you were we're going to just
talk about the benefits and you know
what kind of parties you plan kind of
thing so it's like H you know just
another one who's gone through their
entire career thinking of HR in that way
um and uh you know that's that's one I
don't I don't know how that to break
that I would just like to see HR people
more get onto boards uh and be selected
for board positions and I do see that a
little bit more frequently but maybe
that's an easier place to start then
they get exposure there and then they
can be considered for CEOs down the line
um but yeah it's a I truly believe in it
and I definitely know coo n can hands
down we can nail that um CEO there is a
component about strategy about thinking
big about understanding your Market
understanding your Moe your compe
competitive set and all that kind of
stuff so there is strong business Acumen
that you really do need to have as a CEO
but some of that is about surrounding
yourself with the right talent that has
all that expertise and all you have to
do is ask the right questions you don't
have to have all the right answers um
there's other people you can surround
yourself with um to to have those and
that's what I've seen great CEOs do um
and so I I think HR is is well equipped
to uh handle that now I'm not going to
say every HR person but definitely uh
there's a subset that are quite capable
and JT if I know you well you're
expecting your your people leadership
team to be of that mold what what are
you doing what advice would you give
even to Founders and you know how do you
make
them I think that um there has to be a
willingness to learn
um a willingness to fail a willingness
to be
curious
um
and I would say don't put people first
and I hate saying that but like don't
like put the business first which has
people in it okay and and that is a
little bit hard for HR people to do
because they Index right immediately to
the people um and I get there eventually
but I always start with the
business and uh and then talk about the
consequences that that has for the
people it's such a contrarian thing to
say but it is 100% true that if the
business isn't working then we can't
actually take care of the people yet I
never hear it and I'm curious as to why
that is you know you're asking these
hard questions cuz this is the only way
I know I like you have to start there
right like where else do you start um
you know JT remember remember when the
chief people officer or Nolan job
description the first sentence always
used to be this person owns our culture
right this person this person owns our
feelings I think that we have created an
expectation to your point and a mindset
that that that's what this job is and
it's kind of shifted under our noses
very quickly and I'm not sure we're
catching up fast enough yeah that's fair
that's fair Kelly I think
um yeah I was just what went through my
head is oh yeah and we're the chief
medical officer during covid you know
and we're the chief culture officer um
and I I I when I see those I'm like oh
you know no everyone's responsible for
the culture everyone is responsible for
that we're going through a an a return
to office an r2o uh
initiative and and and I started out
saying this is not an HR initiative this
is actually leadership that is enabled
to make the decisions in regards to the
things we're expecting from you this is
all you it's not me it's not HR it's not
any like you are the ones who are going
to create the tone you're going to set
the level of accountability you're going
to be the ones who can make the
decisions uh around this program
you own this not me I am just enabling
this uh and helping through that so uh
but you have to be so deliberate with
not taking it on yourself because you
always get put back in the box and and
you know even Sanjay was our CEO was
saying JT this is yours I'm like nope
not mine not mine this is the whole
entire company this is a business thing
this is yeah exactly Nolan it's ours but
you have to remind them so I view us as
personal trainers like we have to help
them build their muscle um and build
their their their Rhythm build their um
their style and their form and and then
you need to let them do their thing but
you gotta come back in every once in a
while to remind them like hey you know
your form's off and I think about that
with like Tom Brady New England Patriot
uh you know superstar that is I'm not
even going to mention Tampa Bay go
Boston um but like
Tom he is the like the most elite
athlete and still every every day he
sought Co coaching and trying to
fine-tune and perfect his his craft and
that's what we it like we need to
encourage that with our leaders and
employees is that it's not a bad thing
to ask for help or to get the training
and to get the support to fine-tune your
craft even if you're at the top of your
game game you still need um that that
assistance and that that help uh and so
that's what um that's where some of this
heart stuff comes into and the nurturing
piece and that's when I get the gloss
overs from a lot of the CEOs or like oh
she's talking like human stuff cannot
compute I need to get back to my
financials and ibaa ibaa IA and revenue
revenue um this is too human for us um
uh but it
humans are messy humans are what's uh
creating the value in the company and
humans are creating the zeros and ones
that are making you money so you know
you gotta you gotta tolerate some of it
they they are handcuffed together for
sure they are that's for sure yep H how
do you think about community and the CPO
job is a very lonely Place some people
have said it's the worst best job in
Tech how do you think about building
your community and who are the people
that you lean on I lean on um uh
Cabernet
 
San I'm a bourbon person myself oh I
like bourbon too yes
and
um
so I have to say I'm not good at
this uh I wish that I leaned on my
community more there um and but when I
have they have been so
amazing uh uh and that's the power of
the network is you know Kelly when we
were talking earlier about somebody that
you you know worked with 20 years ago
and all of a sudden they're reaching out
to you well like there's times where I
need to reach out to somebody and
they're like oh my God I remember you of
course I'll help you uh that's the good
human nature in all of us I think is
that we we do want to help people that
we have relationships with or respect um
the CPO role is definitely lonely um for
sure
uh and um I'm glad I have a husband that
is very uh receptive to hearing my
stories and all that good stuff and
sometimes he comes up like oh so tell me
what went on this week you know I'm
interested in hearing more we do that at
my house too yeah yeah yeah so we we
have some fun there I think that
um the
network uh is one where um we help each
other but there're also you know there's
also like this like competition in some
ways and I hate to say it like you want
to help but like you're like all right
well what are you doing and uh like is
that good oh that's good for you like oh
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm like I'm I'm not doing that am
I bad is that like am I behind the time
so like I don't want to feel worse when
I talk to my network especially I have
enough of that in the office right the
fomo in the community is real yeah the
fomo is real absolutely is um a bad
example Le uh of it but I do know that
when I reach out to folks the level of
Engagement and support is real and I'm
so appreciative of that and I believe
that when people do reach out to me that
I try and do the same for them as well
uh so that's all that's all you can do
JT the the loneliness of this job is
real how important is the relationship
with your founder to your own kind of
sense of you know camaraderie and when
when it goes off the rails which let's
be honest it always does at some point
it goes up and down how do you get it
back well um I I may have a lonely job
but he has a lonelier job okay uh and uh
we uh I think that you one you have to
build trust uh in order to share some
vulnerability and some um humbleness and
and uh honesty uh that takes some time
uh and So eventually we can get to a
place and I've gotten there with
everyone some just different a different
dance um stepping on toes maybe a little
bit longer and all that kind of stuff
but we eventually figure those things
out you can tell when there's a bad day
you know they're in a lonely place too
um but there also has to be uh trust
because you know if they're sharing
things you can you go to the board will
you go to the board with that uh you
know how vulnerable can I I I
demonstrate uh to you because you might
be asked Som day and then you have to
reveal um or what are you going to
reveal uh so uh it's it's a balance um
it's a personal choice um but flow is
really important um we don't have to be
best of friends we don't have to be
going to each other's house for dinners
and our husbands and wives getting
together and all that kind of stuff but
flow around the business and
transparency around the business is
really important and very critical to be
successful in your job has there been a
case where the relationship between you
and the CEO didn't work and how did you
know I knew two weeks into a job I was
like
oh um just uh values were not
aligned um but I also felt like wait I I
got to give this a chance like I I have
to see there's purpose here is like I
maybe I have to learn something new from
this and uh I stayed for three
years um uh at that job holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] JT I
did I did um but it was it was tough it
was it it did not it did I wish that we
could have hugged each other before um I
I left and it didn't work out that way
you know time
passes you realize there was a lot of
really good things that came out of that
relationship there was a lot of things
that together we accomplished even if it
was not a fulfilling relationship at a a
personal level where you felt the things
that you
needed and um not that we like oh ho
laugh and connect or anything like that
now or anything like that but there is
just more it's settled time passes and
it's settled um but you if I had to do
it all over again I would have listened
to my gut I'm G to tell you that is I
like and I like I I didn't I just like
no I'm I I made this commitment I should
stick with this
commitment uh but I life is too short to
to to do those things now so you just
got so in that case I was not
courageous um enough to make that change
what have you what have you learned JT
or changed maybe within a 10-year span
right Symphony AI versus maybe a company
 
a company to decide when to join them
did you have you learned any any tidbits
for the audience on that
because it's a thing yeah that's so
funny because um there was this one time
I was interviewing and this uh the CEO
guy said the CEO uh said to me man
you're really grilling me about like my
you know my style and my relationship
and he's like are you coming off of a
bad relationship and I was I was just
coming off of that that relationship
that I was just sharing with you guys
I'm like oh my God is it that
obvious like I'm over rotating I over
rotated yes but it's really important
and in particular when you become the
head of HR that flow that trust that um
that camaraderie uh those values are
extremely important and um uh and there
are also things that you have to make
your list of what am I looking for out
of the next assignment here and for me
going back from Venture into an
operating role it was um I wanted to get
in I wanted an IPO and I wanted the big
leagues of um a leader who made big
decisions was extremely strategic uh um
and no disrespect to Silicon Valley but
I wanted somebody who was a mature adult
versus you know a younger uh product
entrepreneur who was backed by amazing
Venture um but didn't really know how to
strategically be thinking bigger and had
many people around them to help but I
wanted that
gravitas so sometimes you have to think
about what are the things that you're
looking for and that you're missing from
your toolkit that you want to get that
experience around and then you can
tailor your you search and your
interview questions around those things
I love it I love it so many people just
take the companies as they're they're
coming versus applying those types of
filters being thoughtful yeah yeah yeah
have you done any work trials with
companies to try and
drisk well Nolan you know now that's a a
hip thing to do but back in my day nope
what didn't H I didn't do those things I
guess maybe you could say that in some
ways because if you look at my
experience yes I have amazing Brands but
I've also moved on um I have moved on to
a variety of different companies uh to
learn uh different Industries to learn
different life cycles uh you know so
always a creature of learning and
wanting to build out my skill set and
experiences in my network uh in in
different Industries and all that stuff
so um in some ways I guess you can say I
was doing it um but not official
officially so I actually I have a strong
take that the future of executive
interviewing is going to be trying
before you buy because it's best for
both sides right or or you work with the
same person for 20 years right we see
pairs kind of going from company to
company because they know right I mean I
I have to admit I have um a great crew
that has been with me at Salesforce
Living Social um Rocket Fuel uh lithium
these are all the companies ronic Arts
they're all here um and I'm honored that
they actually want to continue working
with me because I definitely have given
them you know a run for their money
around some of these companies but uh
that's that is really helpful uh is to
have the people that you can work with
so I can say I've worked with them for
 
for sure but we have worked together yep
we have the same thing here pendo that's
amazing okay we're going to get get to
the the questions that we ask everybody
I actually want to ask you uh who was
your best hire and
why who's my best
hire I have my CFO right now who is
doing a dance outside my office um he's
incredible I'm sorry and he's in the
corner there he's going like this and
he's jump going by
this he's the best tier yeah yeah okay
who's my best tier who's my best tier
I can't say a person and I can't say a
position I I it it doesn't resonate for
me to say oh this immediate thing um it
it's more of uh I have hired rock stars
in positions uh
that um or and just rock stars in
general and then sometimes those rock
stars don't work out for the company but
they're still rock stars I think about
uh the cultural fit I think about their
resilience I think about um what they
need to learn and am I going to be able
to provide that from them based on what
I know of them and what they've
developed already you know so it's like
a little puzzle that you're trying to
put together as to all those things so
yeah what's your secret weapon in the
candidate experience there's something
around Jeeps that we heard of that you
used to do oh my God yes I don't know
Kell if you remember that but that was
and we had like the bus with the big
brain like we were like purple couches
outside I actually don't know about this
so please educate me that was a good
life F good life oh yeah yeahoo that was
like that was great that was great
training ground for a lot of things liby
stin did an amazing job um what a
community that's still out there it is
it's a very strong community so there's
something around candidate experience or
recruiting and jeeps like what is the
deal with the Jeeps thing the Jeeps was
just like all right if you're going to
now Jeeps are more expensive these days
but if you were to do a $15,000 sign on
why not offer them a Jeep because that's
unique and different instead of $155,000
holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right that's all it was I
don't know when they were 15 grand I've
only owned Jeeps since I was yeah what
are we talking are they used is this
like a police no like this is this was
the ones that Toys are Us at the
kids I know the Chiefs are now really
expensive like that's a nice sign on
bonus for sure like my friend um that
works at Tesla uh she got a Tesla as a
sign on bonus right um you know so I I
think that they one you're you're
involved in the product uh two what a
great story to share um you know so
there's always creative ways for um
creating um marketing campaigns that go
viral and if there's I remember when I
got recruited for Yahoo they flew me out
and they knew that I liked
hiking uh and uh when they flew me out
they said oh you know you and your
husband can go and stay at the um the
awani or the aani uh which is in
yane right like hello they just closed
me at that right there and my husband's
like they're paying for us to stay here
and have a dinner and overnight I'm like
yeah you know and it was all of like 500
bucks right that that they spent but it
created such a memory for for me and my
husband of like wow they really want you
and they actually knew what you liked
the the the um other memorable thing
that I remember from the Yahoo days was
something that a leader did uh for me
where I was saying oh I'm going on a
mountain biking trip and downeyville and
all that kind of stuff oh that's great
he called around to all the hotels to
see where I was staying found the hotel
where we're staying and then comped us
now the rooms were 70 bucks a night so
it was like really cheap but it was the
thought that that counted uh and so
those are the things that you create
like those moments of
personalization you remember it TW 20
years later personalization and surprise
and Delight are such powerful levers
surprise and Delight was one of the
values at Living
Social uh and that is one of the ones
that I still use today yep
personalization surprise and Delight you
got it yeah I love that okay what about
your favorite interview question that
gets you the best signal on candidates
my favorite interview question that get
the signal I would say all right so I
just got to tell you the GC is now
walking by so there's this thing going
on here okay I love that you have a
great team if they can give you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
like that I live for those moments ready
to come over this is what he's doing
right now so he's going like this right
that's called the sprinkler yeah the
sprinkler right and um so usually when
the guys dance in and there's this the
CIO the CFO the clo so I'm expecting the
CIO to come by shortly as well and they
know I'm recording and that's the thing
that is killing me that they're doing
this on purpose um uh but yeah so hazing
is still fine in the workplace from
where I no violence just's no violence
yeah yeah just like casual ribbing so
the question of what do I get candidates
on is um I don't think it's a specific
question but I like to ask questions
that are about like in the range of
things so you know are you in the range
of like are you more commercially
oriented are you more product oriented
are you like you know are you this are
you that so I'm trying to narrow things
down to get to a point where I'm I'm
truly understanding like where they
index and obviously asking a little bit
more questions as to why and what makes
you think that and all that kind of
stuff but um
uh the I think that the you know when
when I'm narrowing it down I uh you know
one of the questions that I do ask is um
uh I give uh the reality is a
symphony um and say is this something
that you can be uh successful
in um and uh and of course everybody's
like oh yeah yeah they might oh yeah
yeah initially but I I put them on the
spot of like here is the realities of
this and I have had candidates say you
know what no that's actually not for me
and I said I that's right I don't think
it is actually for you um and they come
to those own inclus conclusions instead
of me having to tell them that um so uh
it's not one question it's just like
more of an approach to narrow things
down get them to a point where I can you
know share more about what we're about
to then let them reveal if they're
leaning in or if this isn't for them let
candidates opt in or opt out yeah yeah
um and I have found that uh a lot of the
candidates um they appreciate the
candidness they appreciate the um you
know that we're not selling um that you
know like and like this let's be real
like this is a real thing that's going
on here so like if you're going to do it
you got to be like really in on this um
so I think that is it's not an aha but
it's definitely a signal and also when I
am like kind of telling them that
they're not you know this may not be the
right thing for them and they're not
getting it that's also another signal
right different but helpful different
but helpful that's right it's important
it's important yeah so Jen uh we're
going to put a wrap on this thing but is
there anything else that you want to
shout out or discuss before we put a bow
on it no I just think uh well okay yes
Chief people officers are going to have
to deal with AI it's it is here it is
here to stay it is going to be
disruptive and um you have to embrace it
uh and uh it is actually something that
can help human resources from the
standpoint of right now in particular
with the vision of HR being being so
administrative and compliance oriented
and all those kind of things of when you
are leveraging AI to help you with
automation or with data aggregation and
signals it is giving you more time to
think to be more relational and so I
actually think AI will help Elevate
human resources to bring the human back
into it um a bit more um so that that is
the competitive differentiation is your
relationship versus just all the data in
the compliance piece so um Embrace AI um
not because I have it in our name you
know Symphony has it in their name but
it is here to stay we've got to figure
it out uh and the cycle times of going
from one three and five years around
planning it's now one month three months
one year you know and even one year is
to me a long time when we're thinking
about The Innovation that is occurring
on a regular basis around this all uh so
that would be some of my parting words
is uh to my colleagues out there is get
on with it and embrace it it's and it's
a be it's beautiful Tech um that uh can
really make an amazing experience for
employees and to elevate our games you
have to be digitally native and today's
thing is AI and we have have to use it
every day I'm actually curious JT how
are you using Ai and are you using it
every day I use it every day uh I am
with uh chat GPT um and a lot of the
different plugins um like when we're
consolidating 27 employee handbooks into
one unified handbook chat GPT does it
for us instead of an intern that we have
to pay for all summer right um it is uh
for quick connections around benchmarks
or
um approaches to things it helps you
with getting you a draft that you could
spend a couple hours on that it get you
a draft in a couple minutes to just get
your thoughts down um we do have it
embedded in uh some of our our our
applications that we have in our Tech
stack as well um uh we also are doing uh
a program called everyone can AI so this
is not for engineers this is for
everybody at the company we all have to
be eating breathing drinking DNA is AI
and so all of us have to figure out how
to incorporate this into our job and I
just started a thing in HR called hack
your job it's not a hackathon it's hack
your job and how are you hacking your
job with AI so that you can do more
strategic relational things than dealing
with spreadsheets or um reporting and
and uh or that can do an analysis that
uh gives you again the starting point
you still have to own the data own your
own deliverable and that narrative but
um how do how do can we increase our
velocity and our value add in a
different way a common reaction right is
AI is going to replace me AI is going to
take my job you're talking about
something quite different actually
making it more enjoyable and easier yeah
it and and will there be jobs eliminated
sure but there's also going to be jobs
created you know the world economic
Forum has said 85 million jobs are going
to be impacted by AI but 95 million are
going to be created because of it um and
those jobs we don't even know what they
are yet that are going to be out there
so that's why everyone at can AI let's
all embrace it in particular Human
Resources you got to stay with it not
only for your function but also for your
Workforce strategy for sure I love that
JT this has been amazing thank you so
much for spending time with us thank you
guys take care
