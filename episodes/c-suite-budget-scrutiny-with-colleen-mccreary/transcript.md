gut reaction to to the question yeah I
 
gut reaction to to the question yeah I
agree with you I agree with you that one
 
agree with you I agree with you that one
of the things that I learned is like
 
of the things that I learned is like
always assume good
 
always assume good
intent and what I hear from this
 
intent and what I hear from this
question is is like they're crawling up
 
question is is like they're crawling up
my ass and you know they're looking
 
my ass and you know they're looking
around for all of the gaps in my
 
around for all of the gaps in my
strategy like why don't they just trust
 
strategy like why don't they just trust
me and that may not be how it's actually
 
me and that may not be how it's actually
like framed but that's what I hear when
 
like framed but that's what I hear when
when when I hear it and I hear that
 
when when I hear it and I hear that
because I used to feel the same way so
 
because I used to feel the same way so
when I was when I was a door Das you

know and this is this is the thing that
 
know and this is this is the thing that
underpinned the question which is a door
 
underpinned the question which is a door
Dash we were always super lean because
 
Dash we were always super lean because
we operate in a low margin business we
 
we operate in a low margin business we
didn't have the luxury of having the
 
didn't have the luxury of having the
size of Uber's people team and so when I
 
size of Uber's people team and so when I
would get these questions I was always
 
would get these questions I was always
like oh my God like this is like another
 
like oh my God like this is like another

to take responsibility that if you if
they are having to ask you these
 
they are having to ask you these
questions you need to do a better job of
 
questions you need to do a better job of
answering them before they get to you
 
answering them before they get to you
and one of the ways you could do that is
 
and one of the ways you could do that is
to sit down with your CFO and just say
 
to sit down with your CFO and just say
