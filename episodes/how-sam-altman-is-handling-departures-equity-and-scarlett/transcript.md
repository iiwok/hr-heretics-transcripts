now that said here's my take on this
 
now that said here's my take on this
one Founders have no time to read every
 
one Founders have no time to read every
single document that the lawyers produce
 
single document that the lawyers produce
and so really I'm wondering like what
 
and so really I'm wondering like what
was going on with open ai's People team
 
was going on with open ai's People team
because there's not a world that they
 
because there's not a world that they
didn't know this was going on and so two
 
didn't know this was going on and so two
things could be happening one is Sam is
 
things could be happening one is Sam is
lying and he knew that this was the
 
lying and he knew that this was the
policy and didn't care and didn't think
 
policy and didn't care and didn't think
he was going to get in trouble for it
 
he was going to get in trouble for it
the second is is that open ai's People
 
the second is is that open ai's People
team knew this was going on and they
 
team knew this was going on and they
didn't do anything about it lawyers are
 
didn't do anything about it lawyers are
always going to draft documents
 
always going to draft documents
especially external lawyers are going to
 
especially external lawyers are going to
draft documents that are very strongly
 
draft documents that are very strongly
in favor of the company again nobody
 
in favor of the company again nobody
reads all of these documents you just
 
reads all of these documents you just
don't have the time to it and you just
 
don't have the time to it and you just
assume it's good if you never hear about
 
assume it's good if you never hear about
it and the company's been around for
 
it and the company's been around for
like seven years and no one's ever
 
like seven years and no one's ever
talked about this until this reporting
 
talked about this until this reporting
by Kelsey of Vox which again Stellar
 
by Kelsey of Vox which again Stellar
reporting
 
reporting
so here's my take on this one is like I
 
so here's my take on this one is like I
strongly
 
strongly
believe that if you are running a
 
believe that if you are running a
company and you have policies like this
 
company and you have policies like this
you should expect them to be on the
 
you should expect them to be on the
front page of the New York
 
front page of the New York
Times and if it comes out and you can't
 
Times and if it comes out and you can't
defend it you're going to have to walk
 
defend it you're going to have to walk
it back and you're not going to look
 
it back and you're not going to look
great now does this actually end up
 
great now does this actually end up
hurting open AI in any way I I actually
 
hurting open AI in any way I I actually
don't think
 
don't think

even if the stories are negative the big
 
even if the stories are negative the big
question is is does it hurt the company
 
question is is does it hurt the company
