AI so there's three stories out of open
AI in the last like 72 hours that we
need to talk about and we need to talk
about open AI because it might be the
most important company of
generation also two of these stories is
something that I think every company is
going to have to deal with at some point
in time and the third story is just
Stranger than [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fiction and I
don't understand it and I have to talk
about it so let's start with Story
number one so Ilia Suds and Yan Ley
announced that they were leaving so Ilia
is a co-founder and the chief scientist
he was the guy who reportedly was part
of the coup trying to get Sam out last
year
Jan led the super alignment team and the
the charter of his team was essentially
to build AI safely such that like the AI
can ultimately get really smart and kill
us and his team is like trying to make
sure that that doesn't happen so when
Ilia left it was kind of the typical
exact departure like oh wishing you the
best like I believe in open AI very
benign stuff Sam said something similar
Yan didn't say that
and in fact he said that he was
concerned open AI had shifted away from
a safety first culture so here's my take
on this situation exec departures are
part of every company and when you're on
the inside or even when you're on the
outside for a company that's as
important as open AI every departure
feels like high school it's like Jessica
and Ryan just broke up like who are they
going to date next and like what's next
for Ryan and it's just like so
exhausting but there's like a click into
this so for
Ilia as I mentioned earlier he was part
of the coup reportedly part of the coup
that tried to ow Sam as the CEO last
year that we all remember and there's a
line from The Wire which is you come for
the king you best not miss and so I had
expected this one to come down the the
pike just given that Ilia was on the
other side that
lost now now for
Yan there's a couple of interesting
pieces here one is is normally look
execs have disagreements all the time
this is part of business and I firmly
believe you either disagree and
commit and you get on the bus and you
keep going in the direction and then we
figure out what happens later on or you
get off the bus because you can't agree
with the strategy that the CEO is taking
the company and that's what happened
here what makes it more interesting is
that he decided to publicly criticize
the
company
so that doesn't happen very often and
given that they are developing a
technology that is insane it's insanely
awesome today it continues to get better
but you know it could be dangerous in
the
future that's something to watch out for
but nonetheless all right two exec leave
we'll see what happens kind of a thing
now the Second Story is related to the
first story because the Vox reporter I
believe it's Kelsey
Piper decided to dig in and start to try
to talk to employees or ex-employees to
see what was going on and she was
finding that nobody was talking which
isn't that
strange except the reason that they
weren't talking is because open AI was
requiring employees that
departed to sign non-disclosure and
non-disparagement Doc
doents that binded them from ever
talking negatively about the company for
the rest of their lives and if they
did they could have their vested Equity
taken
away and so so anyways she she reads
this language an employee sent it to her
another couple of employees had said one
one employee said it happened to him and
that his Equity was taken away because
he wouldn't sign this document other
employees have validated that it existed
and so she reached out to the company
for comment they didn't get back to her
she runs the story and then Sam the CEO
of open AI goes on Twitter and it's like
I'm embarrassed I can't believe this
happened this is the most embarrassing
moment since I've been running the
company and and they're changing the
policy um and this is like an example of
awesome reporting this is the kind of
Tech reporting that we actually need to
hold companies to account for egregious
policies hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our

now that said here's my take on this
one Founders have no time to read every
single document that the lawyers produce
and so really I'm wondering like what
was going on with open ai's People team
because there's not a world that they
didn't know this was going on and so two
things could be happening one is Sam is
lying and he knew that this was the
policy and didn't care and didn't think
he was going to get in trouble for it
the second is is that open ai's People
team knew this was going on and they
didn't do anything about it lawyers are
always going to draft documents
especially external lawyers are going to
draft documents that are very strongly
in favor of the company again nobody
reads all of these documents you just
don't have the time to it and you just
assume it's good if you never hear about
it and the company's been around for
like seven years and no one's ever
talked about this until this reporting
by Kelsey of Vox which again Stellar
reporting
so here's my take on this one is like I
strongly
believe that if you are running a
company and you have policies like this
you should expect them to be on the
front page of the New York
Times and if it comes out and you can't
defend it you're going to have to walk
it back and you're not going to look
great now does this actually end up
hurting open AI in any way I I actually
don't think
so what I learned from Elon is he spends
zero doar on marketing yet we just
always talk about him because these
things are always in the
news and it appears to me that Sam is
taking a page out of elon's book because
this guy is constantly in the news he's
been on like every podcast in the last
couple of weeks they just released GPT
 
they're not spending money on marketing
and we're always talking about them and
even if the stories are negative the big
question is is does it hurt the company
and my take is right now it
doesn't now all that to say you know
about an hour before I was going to
record
this there was the weirdest post on
Twitter and it turns out that
Scarlett
Johansson was reached out to by Sam
Alman CEO of open AI about being the
voice for GPT 4 and
Beyond and she was he was basically like
look you can help bridge you know
technology and humanity and like had
this like you know Steve Jobs pitched to
her and she was like no I'll pass then
two days before GPT 40 launched he
reached out again and was like hey like
can we make this happen she didn't get a
chance to get back and they launched the
sky voice and Scar Jo's reaction was
that sounds like me like what what is
happening here that sounds like
me and so she hired legal counsel who
wrote letters to Sam and to open Ai and
now she wants to understand how did they
create this voice and her take is is
that
in this new world of AI in which like
deep fakes are going to be a bigger part
of our
society did open AI copy Scarlet
Johansson's Voice or at least aspects of
her
voice without her
consent to be the new Sky
voice that is now talking to us as open
AI
users this is
bizarre so I don't know what's going to
happen here I don't know what's going to
go on with like scarjo and this like
whole Saga but all I can say is is like
open AI is one of the most important
companies of Our Generation I think it's
going to potentially be bigger than what
Google is and so this is why we're
talking about it and I think there's a
lot of lessons here for HR leaders and
for Founders and so just to recap those
number one execs leave that's part of
the deal especially execs who disagree
and can't get on the bus like they leave
and that's okay and that's a normal part
of business number two is is like if you
have egregious
policies they're going to get outed and
people are going to talk about them
number three is don't use Scarlett
Johansson's voice that's just weird let
us know what you think in the comments
uh we'll keep these segments coming talk
to you guys
