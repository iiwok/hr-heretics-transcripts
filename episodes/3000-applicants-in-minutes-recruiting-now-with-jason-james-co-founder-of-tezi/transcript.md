# "3000 Applicants in Minutes": Recruiting Now with Jason James, Co-founder of Tezi

## Transcript

 
Hey everybody, welcome back to another
 
Hey everybody, welcome back to another
episode of HR Heretics. So, this episode
 
episode of HR Heretics. So, this episode
with Jason James from Taisy briefly
 
with Jason James from Taisy briefly
vanished from Spotify. Don't ask us why.
 
vanished from Spotify. Don't ask us why.
I think the content overlords are trying
 
I think the content overlords are trying
to cancel me again, but it's too good to
 
to cancel me again, but it's too good to
not share again. So, here's Jason
 
not share again. So, here's Jason
unpacking the future of recruiting. I
 
unpacking the future of recruiting. I
hope you guys enjoy it.
 
hope you guys enjoy it.
So Jason, you're kind of like a legend
 
So Jason, you're kind of like a legend
in the product game and now you founded
 
in the product game and now you founded
a recruiting company called Ta. Tell us
 
a recruiting company called Ta. Tell us
what Tazy is and what is like a
 
what Tazy is and what is like a
legendary product guy know about
 
legendary product guy know about
recruiting.
 
recruiting.
&gt;&gt; Legendary.
 
&gt;&gt; Legendary.
Um so what is TAZY? We offer agentic
 
Um so what is TAZY? We offer agentic
recruiting labor for the more mundane
 
recruiting labor for the more mundane
aspects of recruiting. So that covers
 
aspects of recruiting. So that covers
things like inbound review, sourcing,
 
things like inbound review, sourcing,
screening, scheduling. We also include a
 
screening, scheduling. We also include a
basic ATS that's more useful to like
 
basic ATS that's more useful to like
early stage companies but you know not
 
early stage companies but you know not
so sophisticated for like later stage
 
so sophisticated for like later stage
and it also comes with 750 million
 
and it also comes with 750 million
global profiles. So it's a very like
 
global profiles. So it's a very like
all-in-one solution especially for early
 
all-in-one solution especially for early
companies just starting out. Then what
 
companies just starting out. Then what
do I know about recruiting? I guess a
 
do I know about recruiting? I guess a
bit over time. So, I've been hiring for
 
bit over time. So, I've been hiring for
my teams since 2004. I've made about 300
 
my teams since 2004. I've made about 300
hires for my teams over the years.
 
hires for my teams over the years.
That's 12 years without recruiting
 
That's 12 years without recruiting
support. So, doing a lot of the leg work
 
support. So, doing a lot of the leg work
myself and then about nine years with
 
myself and then about nine years with
recruiting support. I've worked with
 
recruiting support. I've worked with
teams of one to 100 recruiters. I think
 
teams of one to 100 recruiters. I think
that's about 70 recruiters that I've
 
that's about 70 recruiters that I've
worked with directly between agencies,
 
worked with directly between agencies,
contractors, in-house and yeah, founded
 
contractors, in-house and yeah, founded
a recruiting tech company two years ago
 
a recruiting tech company two years ago
and spent the last two years talking to
 
and spent the last two years talking to
a ton of recruiters as well. Okay. So,
 
a ton of recruiters as well. Okay. So,
I've been like digging into Taisy and
 
I've been like digging into Taisy and
watching a bunch of your podcasts and
 
watching a bunch of your podcasts and
one of the things I was really intrigued
 
one of the things I was really intrigued
by is Max. So, can you give the audience
 
by is Max. So, can you give the audience
like a quick high level of what is Max?
 
like a quick high level of what is Max?
Yeah. So, Max is the name of our AI
 
Yeah. So, Max is the name of our AI
agent that does recruiting on behalf of
 
agent that does recruiting on behalf of
typically in-house talent teams at tech
 
typically in-house talent teams at tech
companies, though it doesn't have to be
 
companies, though it doesn't have to be
that exclusively.
 
that exclusively.
And companies send the like more rote
 
And companies send the like more rote
busy work mundane aspects of recruiting
 
busy work mundane aspects of recruiting
to Max so that they can focus on the
 
to Max so that they can focus on the
more differentiated and human aspects of
 
more differentiated and human aspects of
recruiting which are like setting up the
 
recruiting which are like setting up the
process strategically and
 
process strategically and
building rapport, making offers,
 
building rapport, making offers,
interviewing, that sort of thing.
 
interviewing, that sort of thing.
Whereas Max takes on things like
 
Whereas Max takes on things like
building the sourcing list of
 
building the sourcing list of
candidates, writing emails for them,
 
candidates, writing emails for them,
fielding replies, screening those
 
fielding replies, screening those
inbound applicants both at reviewing the
 
inbound applicants both at reviewing the
applications as well as a quick chat
 
applications as well as a quick chat
screen, scheduling next steps, all of
 
screen, scheduling next steps, all of
that just moves to AI, which we think AI
 
that just moves to AI, which we think AI
is very well suited to handle these
 
is very well suited to handle these
types of things. I went deep on one of
 
types of things. I went deep on one of
the posts describing how Max like scans
 
the posts describing how Max like scans
and surfaces top applicants at companies
 
and surfaces top applicants at companies
that have like hundreds or even
 
that have like hundreds or even
thousands of applications. Like this was
 
thousands of applications. Like this was
always a huge problem for us at every
 
always a huge problem for us at every
company I've worked at because typically
 
company I've worked at because typically
you can't even get through all of the
 
you can't even get through all of the
buckets. So I've been waiting for
 
buckets. So I've been waiting for
software to do this. But one of the
 
software to do this. But one of the
primary concerns I hear from
 
primary concerns I hear from
practitioners is AI bias.
 
practitioners is AI bias.
&gt;&gt; So how do you think about solving that
 
&gt;&gt; So how do you think about solving that
problem? It's a fair concern and so it's
 
problem? It's a fair concern and so it's
something that we've spent a good deal
 
something that we've spent a good deal
of time and effort to address. I think
 
of time and effort to address. I think
it's important not everybody understands
 
it's important not everybody understands
the human equivalent of what happens to
 
the human equivalent of what happens to
set a benchmark of the way it happens
 
set a benchmark of the way it happens
presently with humans.
 
presently with humans.
Most of the time that inbound
 
Most of the time that inbound
application bucket doesn't get reviewed.
 
application bucket doesn't get reviewed.
And it's not out of any ill will, but if
 
And it's not out of any ill will, but if
you have limited hours in your day as a
 
you have limited hours in your day as a
recruiter, it kind of just makes more
 
recruiter, it kind of just makes more
sense to go out and source rather than
 
sense to go out and source rather than
find the two or 3% that's going to be a
 
find the two or 3% that's going to be a
great fit in the inbound application
 
great fit in the inbound application
pile. And so, for the most part, nothing
 
pile. And so, for the most part, nothing
happens, which is unfortunate and not
 
happens, which is unfortunate and not
fair. Then when it does happen, it's
 
fair. Then when it does happen, it's
really fast and cursory typically
 
really fast and cursory typically
because you know the bandwidth
 
because you know the bandwidth
constraints of humans is tough. So then
 
constraints of humans is tough. So then
how do we do it differently with AI?
 
how do we do it differently with AI?
Well, AI will go through all of them. So
 
Well, AI will go through all of them. So
it will crush through 3,000 inbound
 
it will crush through 3,000 inbound
applicants in a matter of minutes. We
 
applicants in a matter of minutes. We
remove name, photo, really any like
 
remove name, photo, really any like
demographic information. So Max isn't
 
demographic information. So Max isn't
aware of these things. It doesn't have a
 
aware of these things. It doesn't have a
concept of like gender or race. And what
 
concept of like gender or race. And what
it's evaluating is objective matching
 
it's evaluating is objective matching
relative to the criteria that the
 
relative to the criteria that the
company sets forward. We've had MAX bias
 
company sets forward. We've had MAX bias
audited as part of compliance with New
 
audited as part of compliance with New
York law 144. So New York requires two
 
York law 144. So New York requires two
protected classes. It's gender and race.
 
protected classes. It's gender and race.
We have monthly antibbias audits
 
We have monthly antibbias audits
starting next month with warden AI which
 
starting next month with warden AI which
will be for the 18 protected classes
 
will be for the 18 protected classes
mentioned in the new California law. So
 
mentioned in the new California law. So
this sets I think a much higher standard
 
this sets I think a much higher standard
than what humans are even held to
 
than what humans are even held to
because also the AI is very transparent
 
because also the AI is very transparent
about its rationale. Whereas humans may
 
about its rationale. Whereas humans may
not necessarily know like how they're
 
not necessarily know like how they're
evaluating and there's all sorts of
 
evaluating and there's all sorts of
unconscious subtle biases at play.
 
unconscious subtle biases at play.
Whereas the AI will tell you exactly why
 
Whereas the AI will tell you exactly why
it thinks a person's a fit, why it's not
 
it thinks a person's a fit, why it's not
a fit and it doesn't have really
 
a fit and it doesn't have really
anything to hide.
 
anything to hide.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The analog there is like Whimo
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The analog there is like Whimo
versus a human driver, right? Like Whimo
 
versus a human driver, right? Like Whimo
is obviously way safer than humans, but
 
is obviously way safer than humans, but
it's probably still going to get in
 
it's probably still going to get in
accidents. It's eventually going to kill
 
accidents. It's eventually going to kill
somebody, but it's going to be at such a
 
somebody, but it's going to be at such a
smaller rate. But because it's a robot,
 
smaller rate. But because it's a robot,
we're a very we're very uncomfortable
 
we're a very we're very uncomfortable
with that. Right.
 
with that. Right.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. Yeah. A question I get a
 
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. Yeah. A question I get a
lot um from folks is both internal
 
lot um from folks is both internal
companies like Taisy and also external
 
companies like Taisy and also external
like to your customers is there should
 
like to your customers is there should
be an element of human something on top
 
be an element of human something on top
of it right like the question is is this
 
of it right like the question is is this
 
someone on my team kind of edit this
 
someone on my team kind of edit this
look at it QA it do you all have any
 
look at it QA it do you all have any
human interventions at Taisy to help you
 
human interventions at Taisy to help you
with this yeah that's kind of something
 
with this yeah that's kind of something
that I think people are a little
 
that I think people are a little
&gt;&gt; confused about out there with the
 
&gt;&gt; confused about out there with the
emergence of all these tools.
 
emergence of all these tools.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it's a good call out. One key
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it's a good call out. One key
point is that like Max, our AI agent, it
 
point is that like Max, our AI agent, it
doesn't make any decisions like in terms
 
doesn't make any decisions like in terms
of advance or reject. All it does is
 
of advance or reject. All it does is
provide recommendations. And so it would
 
provide recommendations. And so it would
say this person seems like a fit and
 
say this person seems like a fit and
should advance. This person does not
 
should advance. This person does not
seem like a fit. But ultimately a human
 
seem like a fit. But ultimately a human
is always making the call to advance or
 
is always making the call to advance or
reject when it comes to any type of
 
reject when it comes to any type of
stage. One is like the laws in some
 
stage. One is like the laws in some
jurisdictions, but two, we just think
 
jurisdictions, but two, we just think
safer and better for everybody right now
 
safer and better for everybody right now
is to have that sort of second line QA
 
is to have that sort of second line QA
done by humans.
 
done by humans.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.
 
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.
&gt;&gt; I saw two things on LinkedIn today
 
&gt;&gt; I saw two things on LinkedIn today
around these like one-way dynamic AI
 
around these like one-way dynamic AI
based interviews. So the idea here is
 
based interviews. So the idea here is
kind of a similar problem set. So many
 
kind of a similar problem set. So many
applicants at the top end of the funnel,
 
applicants at the top end of the funnel,
nobody's looking at the bucket. How do
 
nobody's looking at the bucket. How do
we actually go in and qualify? Yeah.
 
we actually go in and qualify? Yeah.
some of these solutions. Now, Wall
 
some of these solutions. Now, Wall
Street Journal had an article today
 
Street Journal had an article today
which was like your interview is now
 
which was like your interview is now
with AI and so you go through you fill
 
with AI and so you go through you fill
out the application, you submit your
 
out the application, you submit your
resume and then at some point in time
 
resume and then at some point in time
you're met with a link which takes you
 
you're met with a link which takes you
to this AI based interview.
 
to this AI based interview.
&gt;&gt; Uh the person who I saw on LinkedIn
 
&gt;&gt; Uh the person who I saw on LinkedIn
today actually like walked back their
 
today actually like walked back their
experiment was like hey it didn't work
 
experiment was like hey it didn't work
which surprised me. What's your take on
 
which surprised me. What's your take on
that aspect of introducing AI at the top
 
that aspect of introducing AI at the top
of the funnel in an interview format?
 
of the funnel in an interview format?
Well, we've created Max to have
 
Well, we've created Max to have
screening capabilities, which is
 
screening capabilities, which is
comparable to the recruiter phone screen
 
comparable to the recruiter phone screen
in what it tries to cover, which is a
 
in what it tries to cover, which is a
level of just kind of pre-qualification
 
level of just kind of pre-qualification
before the team spends time with this
 
before the team spends time with this
person. Let's try and get some of the
 
person. Let's try and get some of the
basics out of the way of work
 
basics out of the way of work
eligibility, your work location
 
eligibility, your work location
preferences, compensation, why are you
 
preferences, compensation, why are you
on the market, and then the candidate
 
on the market, and then the candidate
gets a chance to get their questions
 
gets a chance to get their questions
asked and answered on whatever's top of
 
asked and answered on whatever's top of
mind for them. If it's things like
 
mind for them. If it's things like
what's the team size, what's your
 
what's the team size, what's your
fundraising or your last fundraising
 
fundraising or your last fundraising
round, these types of things. And so the
 
round, these types of things. And so the
company will provide context and then
 
company will provide context and then
Max can answer those questions for
 
Max can answer those questions for
candidates. Now, we don't think it's all
 
candidates. Now, we don't think it's all
that evaluative, like most candidates
 
that evaluative, like most candidates
will pass that session, but it does help
 
will pass that session, but it does help
bring more color to these applicants and
 
bring more color to these applicants and
weed out the ones that just like clearly
 
weed out the ones that just like clearly
cannot work here because they don't have
 
cannot work here because they don't have
certain qualifications. We predominantly
 
certain qualifications. We predominantly
work right now in the tech industry and
 
work right now in the tech industry and
we think that's the right application.
 
we think that's the right application.
Whereas, you get deeper into the
 
Whereas, you get deeper into the
process, passive candidates especially,
 
process, passive candidates especially,
they want to interact with humans. It's
 
they want to interact with humans. It's
a birectional evaluation of like do I
 
a birectional evaluation of like do I
actually want to work here? Do I want to
 
actually want to work here? Do I want to
work with these people? And so I think
 
work with these people? And so I think
it's in the company's interest to have a
 
it's in the company's interest to have a
person on the other end. Now there's
 
person on the other end. Now there's
probably lower consideration industries
 
probably lower consideration industries
where you could have AI doing more of
 
where you could have AI doing more of
the interviewing, but that's not the
 
the interviewing, but that's not the
space that we operate in. And I don't
 
space that we operate in. And I don't
think that's going to be true. Yeah. In
 
think that's going to be true. Yeah. In
the tech industry for some I don't know
 
the tech industry for some I don't know
for many years, we'll say.
 
for many years, we'll say.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It feels like in order for it to
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It feels like in order for it to
be true, it could only work for inbound
 
be true, it could only work for inbound
applicants. And you really have to
 
applicants. And you really have to
explain why this is better for the
 
explain why this is better for the
candidate experience. But it's such a
 
candidate experience. But it's such a
behavior change right now that I feel
 
behavior change right now that I feel
like most companies are very scared of
 
like most companies are very scared of
introducing that.
 
introducing that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So with our solution, it gets most
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So with our solution, it gets most
often applied to the inbound applicants.
 
often applied to the inbound applicants.
Very few are screening their source
 
Very few are screening their source
candidates. And for the inbound
 
candidates. And for the inbound
applicants, let's say there were 3,000
 
applicants, let's say there were 3,000
that came through. Max says about a
 
that came through. Max says about a
hundred of them are a fit. Then they go
 
hundred of them are a fit. Then they go
through screening and okay, actually 40
 
through screening and okay, actually 40
clear this screening because one some
 
clear this screening because one some
dropped out because they didn't even
 
dropped out because they didn't even
complete it and then some complete it.
 
complete it and then some complete it.
And so then they get 40 candidates that
 
And so then they get 40 candidates that
are like, okay, yeah, these seem
 
are like, okay, yeah, these seem
pre-qualified. We're interested in a
 
pre-qualified. We're interested in a
person spending time with these folks
 
person spending time with these folks
when that would have been zero
 
when that would have been zero
otherwise. And it's trying to make that
 
otherwise. And it's trying to make that
clear for both parties that like you're
 
clear for both parties that like you're
deriving value where there wouldn't have
 
deriving value where there wouldn't have
been value derived.
 
been value derived.
&gt;&gt; Are you stack ranking those people?
 
&gt;&gt; Are you stack ranking those people?
&gt;&gt; Not presently. So it would just be based
 
&gt;&gt; Not presently. So it would just be based
on who completes the screening and then
 
on who completes the screening and then
once the screening is completed then it
 
once the screening is completed then it
would be okay max recommends or doesn't
 
would be okay max recommends or doesn't
recommend but a human reviews that.
 
recommend but a human reviews that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it's like chronological
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it's like chronological
based off of when they apply.
 
based off of when they apply.
&gt;&gt; Got it. And Nolan, you mentioned kind of
 
&gt;&gt; Got it. And Nolan, you mentioned kind of
a lot of folks are scared of
 
a lot of folks are scared of
implementing, right? [clears throat]
 
implementing, right? [clears throat]
This I I I also get a lot of questions
 
This I I I also get a lot of questions
on a lot of folks are feeling
 
on a lot of folks are feeling
overwhelmed and excited, but also
 
overwhelmed and excited, but also
overwhelmed at all the AI tools across
 
overwhelmed at all the AI tools across
recruiting that are popping up, Jason,
 
recruiting that are popping up, Jason,
like
 
like
&gt;&gt; how do you think about that? And then I
 
&gt;&gt; how do you think about that? And then I
get, you know, talk to founders, well,
 
get, you know, talk to founders, well,
it's a race. You know, all these all
 
it's a race. You know, all these all
these tools are somewhat similar. or
 
these tools are somewhat similar. or
maybe they ven diagram overlap but it is
 
maybe they ven diagram overlap but it is
it's a race to see who can kind of
 
it's a race to see who can kind of
figure this out first and get to market
 
figure this out first and get to market
and I'm hearing that in different
 
and I'm hearing that in different
industries whether it's legal tech or
 
industries whether it's legal tech or
recruiting or this or AI h how would you
 
recruiting or this or AI h how would you
help the audience think about that and
 
help the audience think about that and
how do you think about that
 
how do you think about that
&gt;&gt; it is a very difficult environment both
 
&gt;&gt; it is a very difficult environment both
as I guess an offer of services to
 
as I guess an offer of services to
differentiate as well as for a buyer to
 
differentiate as well as for a buyer to
figure out signal from noise our
 
figure out signal from noise our
strategy where we differentiate will We
 
strategy where we differentiate will We
try to be more all-in-one than point
 
try to be more all-in-one than point
solution. And that's hard to execute
 
solution. And that's hard to execute
with a high quality bar is to be like
 
with a high quality bar is to be like
good across like many features, but
 
good across like many features, but
companies seem to have little tolerance
 
companies seem to have little tolerance
right now for adding point solutions.
 
right now for adding point solutions.
And so we tried to be pretty holistic.
 
And so we tried to be pretty holistic.
And then we we skew towards like
 
And then we we skew towards like
automation and agentic labor more than
 
automation and agentic labor more than
co-pilot. Now, we have backed into some
 
co-pilot. Now, we have backed into some
co-pilot features, but we are a solution
 
co-pilot features, but we are a solution
for those that are really feeling like
 
for those that are really feeling like
underwater. They're have way too much to
 
underwater. They're have way too much to
do, too little time to do it, and they
 
do, too little time to do it, and they
need capacity on their recruiting labor.
 
need capacity on their recruiting labor.
Whereas, if you're just looking for like
 
Whereas, if you're just looking for like
 
a human recruiter's workflow, gosh,
 
a human recruiter's workflow, gosh,
there's dozens, maybe hundreds of tools
 
there's dozens, maybe hundreds of tools
right now that can probably achieve
 
right now that can probably achieve
that. So, it's a tough environment,
 
that. So, it's a tough environment,
&gt;&gt; but but I I want to agree. I don't know
 
&gt;&gt; but but I I want to agree. I don't know
if you agree, Nolan, but the all-in-one
 
if you agree, Nolan, but the all-in-one
the all-in-one differentiator, it's
 
the all-in-one differentiator, it's
always been like that for me. Like, I
 
always been like that for me. Like, I
remember talking to a founder back in
 
remember talking to a founder back in
 
analytics HR platform, and I said,
 
analytics HR platform, and I said,
listen, the person who figures out how
 
listen, the person who figures out how
to help me do end to end with the least
 
to help me do end to end with the least
amount of tools as possible wins.
 
amount of tools as possible wins.
The reason why that's true, Kelly, is
 
The reason why that's true, Kelly, is
because people, it's easier typically,
 
because people, it's easier typically,
like especially with an ATS, it's a
 
like especially with an ATS, it's a
system of record, and so you want your
 
system of record, and so you want your
system of record to be like the thing
 
system of record to be like the thing
that you're going back to all the time
 
that you're going back to all the time
and things that are working on top of
 
and things that are working on top of
it. The challenge is, as Jason
 
it. The challenge is, as Jason
mentioned, it's hard to be really good
 
mentioned, it's hard to be really good
at many different things. And then the
 
at many different things. And then the
other challenge is is like you know
 
other challenge is is like you know
Microsoft famously bundles and we'll get
 
Microsoft famously bundles and we'll get
you in on a cheap discount and then you
 
you in on a cheap discount and then you
know when renewal comes up it becomes a
 
know when renewal comes up it becomes a
lot more expensive and typically down
 
lot more expensive and typically down
the road if you're growing as a company
 
the road if you're growing as a company
now your challenge is is like well god
 
now your challenge is is like well god
it's going to take forever to offboard
 
it's going to take forever to offboard
and implement something new and so I
 
and implement something new and so I
think about this challenge all the time
 
think about this challenge all the time
I talk to friends about it I'm currently
 
I talk to friends about it I'm currently
in the camp of because primarily where
 
in the camp of because primarily where

HR. And one of my favorite conversations
 
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
 
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about

optimizing for compliance. It's

optimizing for people, for culture,
 
optimizing for people, for culture,

&gt;&gt; All right. So, in I went again, as I
 
&gt;&gt; All right. So, in I went again, as I
mentioned, I went deep on your podcast
 
mentioned, I went deep on your podcast
and in one you said RC's and sorcers
 
and in one you said RC's and sorcers
find something else. And the reason why
 
find something else. And the reason why
you said that I believe is because you
 
you said that I believe is because you
think scheduling is going to be solved
 
think scheduling is going to be solved
in the next couple of years and sourcing
 
in the next couple of years and sourcing
is not going to be a role. I tend to
 
is not going to be a role. I tend to
agree with that. But how do you think
 
agree with that. But how do you think
about growing this like next generation
 
about growing this like next generation
of recruiters? Like I came up I started
 
of recruiters? Like I came up I started
as a recruiting coordinator. That's if I
 
as a recruiting coordinator. That's if I
didn't have that entry level role,
 
didn't have that entry level role,
there's no way that I'm doing this right
 
there's no way that I'm doing this right
now with all of my time. How do you
 
now with all of my time. How do you
think about that challenge?
 
think about that challenge?
&gt;&gt; I guess how you represented my point of
 
&gt;&gt; I guess how you represented my point of
view is accurate. And I'm not saying
 
view is accurate. And I'm not saying
that it's necessarily Tazy that like
 
that it's necessarily Tazy that like
wins and you know does all of sourcing
 
wins and you know does all of sourcing
and all of recruiting coordination. It's
 
and all of recruiting coordination. It's
just I recognize that technology is
 
just I recognize that technology is
close to being able to just do this
 
close to being able to just do this
better than you know any human. And so
 
better than you know any human. And so
given that to answer your question how
 
given that to answer your question how
do you envision the future for full life
 
do you envision the future for full life
cycle recruiters? Do you think that
 
cycle recruiters? Do you think that
there are more or fewer? I think there
 
there are more or fewer? I think there
are fewer.
 
are fewer.
&gt;&gt; Five years
 
&gt;&gt; Five years
&gt;&gt; fewer.
 
&gt;&gt; fewer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I don't know that the
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I don't know that the
entrylevel rules will exist in that if
 
entrylevel rules will exist in that if
you have a bunch of mid-level senior
 
you have a bunch of mid-level senior
full cycle recruiters struggling to find
 
full cycle recruiters struggling to find
fewer jobs, you need the entry-level
 
fewer jobs, you need the entry-level
roles if you believe that there's
 
roles if you believe that there's
continued growth in in the field, which
 
continued growth in in the field, which
I I question. That said, also to me it
 
I I question. That said, also to me it
seems like the entry level stuff already
 
seems like the entry level stuff already
went away in that it's largely what I've
 
went away in that it's largely what I've
seen moved offshore and it's like
 
seen moved offshore and it's like
Athenas doing the jobs now in Kenya and
 
Athenas doing the jobs now in Kenya and
the Philippines rather than like
 
the Philippines rather than like
full-timers. So, if there's going to be
 
full-timers. So, if there's going to be
an entrylevel role, it's going to have
 
an entrylevel role, it's going to have
to probably be an entry-level full cycle
 
to probably be an entry-level full cycle
recruiter. I just don't think that
 
recruiter. I just don't think that
there'll be that many. And this isn't a
 
there'll be that many. And this isn't a
problem exclusive to recruiting. We see
 
problem exclusive to recruiting. We see
it, you know, in engineering. It's
 
it, you know, in engineering. It's
happening in product management. It's
 
happening in product management. It's
happening in sales. And it's a really
 
happening in sales. And it's a really
tough time to be a new grad. I think
 
tough time to be a new grad. I think
&gt;&gt; to do as well as I'd like in my past
 
&gt;&gt; to do as well as I'd like in my past
experiences. So,
 
experiences. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah, I think that'll be like each CHRO
 
&gt;&gt; yeah, I think that'll be like each CHRO
will make their own choice as to like,
 
will make their own choice as to like,
okay, would I rather repurpose this head
 
okay, would I rather repurpose this head
with the same person? Um,
 
with the same person? Um,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
 
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; but I think they'll have more
 
&gt;&gt; but I think they'll have more
flexibility in their budgets because
 
flexibility in their budgets because
like
 
like
&gt;&gt; that's the point and software can kind
 
&gt;&gt; that's the point and software can kind
of like trade off against each other
 
of like trade off against each other
now.
 
now.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's kind of what I've
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's kind of what I've
been kind of screaming from the rooftops
 
been kind of screaming from the rooftops
is people like, "Well, my job's going to
 
is people like, "Well, my job's going to
go away." And my thing, it's like, "No,
 
go away." And my thing, it's like, "No,
it just changes because now we can kind
 
it just changes because now we can kind
of do all these things." So, I offer
 
of do all these things." So, I offer
that because that's how I've been
 
that because that's how I've been
thinking about this the past, you know,
 
thinking about this the past, you know,
few months. I so I talked to my buddy
 
few months. I so I talked to my buddy
Evan Connors at Ambience and him and I
 
Evan Connors at Ambience and him and I
are I think working on a hypothesis
 
are I think working on a hypothesis
together about I actually think there's
 
together about I actually think there's
a ton of alpha to be had at the new grad
 
a ton of alpha to be had at the new grad
level because like these kids are coming
 
level because like these kids are coming
out native in AI. They have to get
 
out native in AI. They have to get
really really scrappy like a lot
 
really really scrappy like a lot
scrappier than we were given the
 
scrappier than we were given the
constraints in the job market. And so
 
constraints in the job market. And so
you really have like your pick of the
 
you really have like your pick of the
litter on them. And if you do design
 
litter on them. And if you do design
something like you know call it a
 
something like you know call it a
rotational program or something to where
 
rotational program or something to where
like these people can come in and try
 
like these people can come in and try
different aspects of the business. I
 
different aspects of the business. I
feel like actually that might be a a
 
feel like actually that might be a a
path in the future. We did this at
 
path in the future. We did this at
Google. We had rotation programs. It was
 
Google. We had rotation programs. It was
typically within people ops, but I
 
typically within people ops, but I
actually think now it's going to be like
 
actually think now it's going to be like
across the entire business and then
 
across the entire business and then
somebody can come back into recruiting
 
somebody can come back into recruiting
and have like the full business context
 
and have like the full business context
because not only did they do recruiting,
 
because not only did they do recruiting,
they went and like were an STR and did
 
they went and like were an STR and did
some other things. So that's where I
 
some other things. So that's where I
think it's ultimately going. Um, but
 
think it's ultimately going. Um, but
it's to your point, Jason, like you're
 
it's to your point, Jason, like you're
only hiring senior engineers.
 
only hiring senior engineers.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And that is uh that's it's an easy lever
 
&gt;&gt; And that is uh that's it's an easy lever
to go to because they need less
 
to go to because they need less
coaching.
 
coaching.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we've been debating and
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we've been debating and
considering hiring junior because of
 
considering hiring junior because of
what you mentioned where it's like,
 
what you mentioned where it's like,
okay, we're like a 15 person seed stage
 
okay, we're like a 15 person seed stage
startup. It would be hard to compete for
 
startup. It would be hard to compete for
the top 1 to 10% of talent from the new
 
the top 1 to 10% of talent from the new
grad population in 2021.
 
grad population in 2021.
Now, there might be more top talent
 
Now, there might be more top talent
that's less competitive because fewer
 
that's less competitive because fewer
people are hiring. So maybe now is a
 
people are hiring. So maybe now is a
good time to try to pick up some of them
 
good time to try to pick up some of them
because they're still just as talented
 
because they're still just as talented
as they were. It's just I guess less
 
as they were. It's just I guess less
demand for their services.
 
demand for their services.
&gt;&gt; That's exactly it. That's exactly it. So
 
&gt;&gt; That's exactly it. That's exactly it. So
I listened to your Harry Stings pod
 
I listened to your Harry Stings pod
which you had some banger quotes out of
 
which you had some banger quotes out of
that one. One was people with great
 
that one. One was people with great
resumes often rode the elevator up. What
 
resumes often rode the elevator up. What
do you mean by that? Okay. So, there's
 
do you mean by that? Okay. So, there's
businesses that
 
businesses that
are formed that
 
are formed that
were always going to be successful
 
were always going to be successful
because they're riding some long-term
 
because they're riding some long-term
secular trend that it's technology wave.
 
secular trend that it's technology wave.
So, think like, okay, with the cloud and
 
So, think like, okay, with the cloud and
mobile paradigm shift, there was always
 
mobile paradigm shift, there was always
going to be a business like Uber. There
 
going to be a business like Uber. There
was always going to be a business like
 
was always going to be a business like
Spotify. And whether you know Uber or
 
Spotify. And whether you know Uber or
Lift one, that was up for debate, but
 
Lift one, that was up for debate, but
there was always going to be some like
 
there was always going to be some like
taxi app on your phone. And so that
 
taxi app on your phone. And so that
elevator is going up. People that work
 
elevator is going up. People that work
at that company during those time
 
at that company during those time
periods, they can be potentially just
 
periods, they can be potentially just
riding that elevator and benefiting from
 
riding that elevator and benefiting from
the company success and it shows up as
 
the company success and it shows up as
resume success for them. or they could
 
resume success for them. or they could
actually alter and support the
 
actually alter and support the
trajectory of that company. They could
 
trajectory of that company. They could
be the key contributors to the company's
 
be the key contributors to the company's
success. It's often hard to disambiguate
 
success. It's often hard to disambiguate
those two things. I've seen founders get
 
those two things. I've seen founders get
themselves in trouble by just like being
 
themselves in trouble by just like being
like, "Oh, great resume." Like they were
 
like, "Oh, great resume." Like they were
at this company during this time during
 
at this company during this time during
hyperrowth and this company during that
 
hyperrowth and this company during that
time. And then you find out like this
 
time. And then you find out like this
person I don't know can't even like put
 
person I don't know can't even like put
together a coherent plan or roadmap or
 
together a coherent plan or roadmap or
strategy and it's like it's just tough
 
strategy and it's like it's just tough
to learn that on you know a year into
 
to learn that on you know a year into
making that key higher. We've talked
 
making that key higher. We've talked
about this so many times, Nolan, right?
 
about this so many times, Nolan, right?
Like the like the worry of pedigree,
 
Like the like the worry of pedigree,
right? Halo resume writing coat tales of
 
right? Halo resume writing coat tales of
Yeah, exactly.
 
Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; So, so Jason, how do you then like, you
 
&gt;&gt; So, so Jason, how do you then like, you
know, if you dismbiguates the word that
 
know, if you dismbiguates the word that
you used, how do you think about
 
you used, how do you think about
assessing these people and understanding
 
assessing these people and understanding
if they were actually part of the core
 
if they were actually part of the core
contribution or not?
 
contribution or not?
you find with people that are I guess
 
you find with people that are I guess
very good and very integral one there's
 
very good and very integral one there's
like a level of depth to like any answer
 
like a level of depth to like any answer
that they're giving you like you can
 
that they're giving you like you can
kind of keep digging and they are able
 
kind of keep digging and they are able
to deliver at the 40,000 10,000 like 100
 
to deliver at the 40,000 10,000 like 100
ground level like they know it in and
 
ground level like they know it in and
out and can speak to like all of that
 
out and can speak to like all of that
with clarity that means that they were
 
with clarity that means that they were
like really in the thick of it which is
 
like really in the thick of it which is
helpful to sus out.
 
helpful to sus out.
I find that back channels are just
 
I find that back channels are just
invaluable. Like go talk to a bunch of
 
invaluable. Like go talk to a bunch of
people that they worked with, both the
 
people that they worked with, both the
ones they introduced you to as well as
 
ones they introduced you to as well as
ones that they haven't, and ask around
 
ones that they haven't, and ask around
what did they do? How did they
 
what did they do? How did they
contribute? Do you think it like really
 
contribute? Do you think it like really
mattered for the outcome of the company?
 
mattered for the outcome of the company?
And if so, like how? And you get a bunch
 
And if so, like how? And you get a bunch
of valuable signal from that.
 
of valuable signal from that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was just like chilling in the
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was just like chilling in the
audience. I don't know if any of you are
 
audience. I don't know if any of you are
thinking this right now, but I was just
 
thinking this right now, but I was just
thinking like when is Max going to be
 
thinking like when is Max going to be
able to to tell me that.
 
able to to tell me that.
&gt;&gt; I would love that. Yeah, [laughter] we
 
&gt;&gt; I would love that. Yeah, [laughter] we
got some like I guess more foundational
 
got some like I guess more foundational
stuff, but [laughter]
 
stuff, but [laughter]
I do think like AI could be quite good
 
I do think like AI could be quite good
at that. Like reference checks and back
 
at that. Like reference checks and back
channels and stuff like that. Who knows
 
channels and stuff like that. Who knows
who? Uh and like
 
who? Uh and like
&gt;&gt; set up a schedule, schedule a call with
 
&gt;&gt; set up a schedule, schedule a call with
them at least.
 
them at least.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; cuz that's like the dream, right? When
 
&gt;&gt; cuz that's like the dream, right? When
can Max just put three people on my
 
can Max just put three people on my
doorstep that are perfect for me and
 
doorstep that are perfect for me and
this company at this period of time,
 
this company at this period of time,
&gt;&gt; right?
 
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; 100%. So, St. Pod, you mentioned that at
 
&gt;&gt; 100%. So, St. Pod, you mentioned that at
Instacart you were working 100hour weeks
 
Instacart you were working 100hour weeks
and that 72 hours a week was kind of
 
and that 72 hours a week was kind of
stasis.
 
stasis.
&gt;&gt; Like, isn't that a bit much? Like, did
 
&gt;&gt; Like, isn't that a bit much? Like, did
is that really true?
 
is that really true?
&gt;&gt; That is really true. Yeah, it's not that
 
&gt;&gt; That is really true. Yeah, it's not that
hard to get to 72 hours. I I'd mentioned
 
hard to get to 72 hours. I I'd mentioned
that because this 996 culture stuff,
 
that because this 996 culture stuff,
like that's, you know, 72 hours a week.
 
like that's, you know, 72 hours a week.
So, for me, it was like work from 6:00
 
So, for me, it was like work from 6:00
a.m. to 6:00 p.m. 5 days a week. Then a
 
a.m. to 6:00 p.m. 5 days a week. Then a
couple nights, hop back online, work for
 
couple nights, hop back online, work for
a few hours, you know, one or two nights
 
a few hours, you know, one or two nights
a week, and then like a half day on
 
a week, and then like a half day on
Sunday, Sunday morning or something. Or
 
Sunday, Sunday morning or something. Or
work fewer nights, but work all day
 
work fewer nights, but work all day
Sunday. And like it's not great. I'm not
 
Sunday. And like it's not great. I'm not
saying it's like fun or feels good or
 
saying it's like fun or feels good or
it's good for my relationships, but it
 
it's good for my relationships, but it
is common and it's pretty unremarkable
 
is common and it's pretty unremarkable
and often expected. And so the thing
 
and often expected. And so the thing

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, it's like all It was I
actually like laughed at that one. I
 
actually like laughed at that one. I
thought it was good. But like
 
thought it was good. But like
&gt;&gt; how do you pitch that to candidates?
 
&gt;&gt; how do you pitch that to candidates?
&gt;&gt; Because you know ultimately like you
 
&gt;&gt; Because you know ultimately like you
know I got kids. I actually think like
 
know I got kids. I actually think like
I'm phased out of the startup era
 
I'm phased out of the startup era
especially early stage because I have
 
especially early stage because I have
kids. But how do you how do you
 
kids. But how do you how do you
communicate that? And then the second
 
communicate that? And then the second
piece, isn't it about outputs? Like
 
piece, isn't it about outputs? Like
isn't outputs the thing that we're
 
isn't outputs the thing that we're
actually measuring here?
 
actually measuring here?

culture like that's not I was just kind
 
culture like that's not I was just kind
of like ragging on all that really
 
of like ragging on all that really
matters is the outcomes. And so, I don't
 
matters is the outcomes. And so, I don't
care how many hours like people work to
 
care how many hours like people work to
do it. Like I said, then was we have the
 
do it. Like I said, then was we have the
this fractional PM that puts in 15 hours
 
this fractional PM that puts in 15 hours
a week and it's better than many of the
 
a week and it's better than many of the
PMs I've worked with at 50 hours a week.
 
PMs I've worked with at 50 hours a week.
And I'm entirely happy like with that.
 
And I'm entirely happy like with that.
It's like having a full-timer, but he
 
It's like having a full-timer, but he
just gets it done faster because he's
 
just gets it done faster because he's
very, very good. I think that's
 
very, very good. I think that's
ultimately what matters. The way we set
 
ultimately what matters. The way we set
expectations, or at least try to with
 
expectations, or at least try to with
our folks, though, is we're going to try
 
our folks, though, is we're going to try
and work smart and so be focused, try to

think it's important to invest in
 
think it's important to invest in
culture. So, I want to be clear about
 
culture. So, I want to be clear about
that because you don't know when the
 
that because you don't know when the
growth is going to slow or hit a wall
 
growth is going to slow or hit a wall
and completely stop. But at the end of
 
and completely stop. But at the end of
the day, like the company needs to be
 
the day, like the company needs to be
growing like above all because folks
 
growing like above all because folks
need a path. They need progression in
 
need a path. They need progression in
their careers and they need to feel like
 
their careers and they need to feel like
their equity is going to be worth
 
their equity is going to be worth
something. they need to. And so it's
 
something. they need to. And so it's
crazy how much like growth covers sort
 
crazy how much like growth covers sort
of like a multitude of sins and solves
 
of like a multitude of sins and solves
nearly all problems. But yeah, that
 
nearly all problems. But yeah, that
said, I would advise every founder to at
 
said, I would advise every founder to at
least put in some of effort on culture,
 
least put in some of effort on culture,
to be talking about it, to like be
 
to be talking about it, to like be
intentional about it because what keeps
 
intentional about it because what keeps
people in the hard times will be the
 
people in the hard times will be the
bonds that they have with one another
 
bonds that they have with one another
and their like attachment to the
 
and their like attachment to the
company, the mission, the vision, that
 
company, the mission, the vision, that
sort of thing. How are you guys thinking
 
sort of thing. How are you guys thinking
about that right now given that you're
 
about that right now given that you're
you know obviously 15 people seed stage
 
you know obviously 15 people seed stage
it's an insanely competitive market you
 
it's an insanely competitive market you
know what like what what's the pitch and
 
know what like what what's the pitch and
how do you hook me with your culture
 
how do you hook me with your culture
&gt;&gt; the people that join us tend to join
 
&gt;&gt; the people that join us tend to join
because the way that we are articulated
 
because the way that we are articulated
our like values some of them kind of
 
our like values some of them kind of
stand out and resonate so one of which
 
stand out and resonate so one of which
is like committed to calm and so by that
 
is like committed to calm and so by that
we don't mean we're super chill
 
we don't mean we're super chill
but that we will be calm and focused and
 
but that we will be calm and focused and
deliberate. We will avoid thrash and
 
deliberate. We will avoid thrash and
chaos and we will be as steady as one
 
chaos and we will be as steady as one
can be in this sort of journey even
 
can be in this sort of journey even
though we will work with like intensity.
 
though we will work with like intensity.
So for folks that have been through very
 
So for folks that have been through very
volatile situations, that's attractive.
 
volatile situations, that's attractive.
And that comes from myself and my
 
And that comes from myself and my
co-founder being old founders.
 
co-founder being old founders.
Basically, I'm in my 40s, he's in his
 
Basically, I'm in my 40s, he's in his
 
stuff. And so there's a level of like
 
stuff. And so there's a level of like
resilience that we can bring and calm to
 
resilience that we can bring and calm to
the storm that that we can bring. So we
 
the storm that that we can bring. So we
try to differentiate on that. We're
 
try to differentiate on that. We're
committed to like a team of adults and
 
committed to like a team of adults and
by that we mean we will provide trust
 
by that we mean we will provide trust
and freedom to our team and then we
 
and freedom to our team and then we
expect sort of wise judgment and
 
expect sort of wise judgment and
thoughtfulness about you know what the
 
thoughtfulness about you know what the
business needs and so there's this like
 
business needs and so there's this like
mutual respect and trust and freedom and
 
mutual respect and trust and freedom and
responsibility very like Netflixy in
 
responsibility very like Netflixy in
that regard and so these types of things
 
that regard and so these types of things
tend to resonate with the folks that
 
tend to resonate with the folks that
come join us.
 
come join us.
&gt;&gt; I love that.
 
&gt;&gt; I love that.
&gt;&gt; Also, at our stage, like we've mostly
 
&gt;&gt; Also, at our stage, like we've mostly
built from like the allstars of our
 
built from like the allstars of our
network.
 
network.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then there's already built-in
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then there's already built-in
trust, but I mean I Kelly and I talk
 
trust, but I mean I Kelly and I talk
about this all the time that you
 
about this all the time that you
ultimately culture should serve as a
 
ultimately culture should serve as a
magnet for the people that you want to
 
magnet for the people that you want to
attract and a deterrent for the people
 
attract and a deterrent for the people
you want to avoid. Right? So what when
 
you want to avoid. Right? So what when
you say those things to me, what I
 
you say those things to me, what I
experience is is like a very mature
 
experience is is like a very mature
adult workplace to where when problems
 
adult workplace to where when problems
happen, you know, we're not just like
 
happen, you know, we're not just like
pointing fingers or scrambling, like
 
pointing fingers or scrambling, like
we're being thoughtful about how we
 
we're being thoughtful about how we
solve them
 
solve them
&gt;&gt; and thoughtful in our communication,
 
&gt;&gt; and thoughtful in our communication,
which I think is attractive to most
 
which I think is attractive to most
adults,
 
adults,
&gt;&gt; right?
 
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The thing I would add there, it's,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The thing I would add there, it's,
you know, it's also glue for the company
 
you know, it's also glue for the company
when things don't go great, you know,
 
when things don't go great, you know,
and I think I was going to call call it
 
and I think I was going to call call it
out and you already said it, Jason, is
 
out and you already said it, Jason, is
is by no means were you saying not to
 
is by no means were you saying not to
invest in culture because that's the
 
invest in culture because that's the
glue that holds it together when when
 
glue that holds it together when when
kind of goes sideways as well,
 
kind of goes sideways as well,
&gt;&gt; which always does.
 
&gt;&gt; which always does.
 always does. But yeah, what I found
 
 always does. But yeah, what I found
though is like if you optimize for
 
though is like if you optimize for
culture directly, what you end up doing
 
culture directly, what you end up doing
is kind of playing whack-a-ole on like
 
is kind of playing whack-a-ole on like
employee complaints if you're not
 
employee complaints if you're not
growing. And so what you want to be
 
growing. And so what you want to be
doing is you get as a, you know, the
 
doing is you get as a, you know, the
highest level leaders, the business
 
highest level leaders, the business
needs to be growing and succeeding and
 
needs to be growing and succeeding and
then you kind of knock off the like top
