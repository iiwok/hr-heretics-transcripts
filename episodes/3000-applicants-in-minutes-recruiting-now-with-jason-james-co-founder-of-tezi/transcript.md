# "3000 Applicants in Minutes": Recruiting Now with Jason James, Co-founder of Tezi

## Transcript

 
Hey everybody, welcome back to another
episode of HR Heretics. So, this episode
with Jason James from Taisy briefly
vanished from Spotify. Don't ask us why.
I think the content overlords are trying
to cancel me again, but it's too good to
not share again. So, here's Jason
unpacking the future of recruiting. I
hope you guys enjoy it.
So Jason, you're kind of like a legend
in the product game and now you founded
a recruiting company called Ta. Tell us
what Tazy is and what is like a
legendary product guy know about
recruiting.
&gt;&gt; Legendary.
Um so what is TAZY? We offer agentic
recruiting labor for the more mundane
aspects of recruiting. So that covers
things like inbound review, sourcing,
screening, scheduling. We also include a
basic ATS that's more useful to like
early stage companies but you know not
so sophisticated for like later stage
and it also comes with 750 million
global profiles. So it's a very like
all-in-one solution especially for early
companies just starting out. Then what
do I know about recruiting? I guess a
bit over time. So, I've been hiring for
my teams since 2004. I've made about 300
hires for my teams over the years.
That's 12 years without recruiting
support. So, doing a lot of the leg work
myself and then about nine years with
recruiting support. I've worked with
teams of one to 100 recruiters. I think
that's about 70 recruiters that I've
worked with directly between agencies,
contractors, in-house and yeah, founded
a recruiting tech company two years ago
and spent the last two years talking to
a ton of recruiters as well. Okay. So,
I've been like digging into Taisy and
watching a bunch of your podcasts and
one of the things I was really intrigued
by is Max. So, can you give the audience
like a quick high level of what is Max?
Yeah. So, Max is the name of our AI
agent that does recruiting on behalf of
typically in-house talent teams at tech
companies, though it doesn't have to be
that exclusively.
And companies send the like more rote
busy work mundane aspects of recruiting
to Max so that they can focus on the
more differentiated and human aspects of
recruiting which are like setting up the
process strategically and
building rapport, making offers,
interviewing, that sort of thing.
Whereas Max takes on things like
building the sourcing list of
candidates, writing emails for them,
fielding replies, screening those
inbound applicants both at reviewing the
applications as well as a quick chat
screen, scheduling next steps, all of
that just moves to AI, which we think AI
is very well suited to handle these
types of things. I went deep on one of
the posts describing how Max like scans
and surfaces top applicants at companies
that have like hundreds or even
thousands of applications. Like this was
always a huge problem for us at every
company I've worked at because typically
you can't even get through all of the
buckets. So I've been waiting for
software to do this. But one of the
primary concerns I hear from
practitioners is AI bias.
&gt;&gt; So how do you think about solving that
problem? It's a fair concern and so it's
something that we've spent a good deal
of time and effort to address. I think
it's important not everybody understands
the human equivalent of what happens to
set a benchmark of the way it happens
presently with humans.
Most of the time that inbound
application bucket doesn't get reviewed.
And it's not out of any ill will, but if
you have limited hours in your day as a
recruiter, it kind of just makes more
sense to go out and source rather than
find the two or 3% that's going to be a
great fit in the inbound application
pile. And so, for the most part, nothing
happens, which is unfortunate and not
fair. Then when it does happen, it's
really fast and cursory typically
because you know the bandwidth
constraints of humans is tough. So then
how do we do it differently with AI?
Well, AI will go through all of them. So
it will crush through 3,000 inbound
applicants in a matter of minutes. We
remove name, photo, really any like
demographic information. So Max isn't
aware of these things. It doesn't have a
concept of like gender or race. And what
it's evaluating is objective matching
relative to the criteria that the
company sets forward. We've had MAX bias
audited as part of compliance with New
York law 144. So New York requires two
protected classes. It's gender and race.
We have monthly antibbias audits
starting next month with warden AI which
will be for the 18 protected classes
mentioned in the new California law. So
this sets I think a much higher standard
than what humans are even held to
because also the AI is very transparent
about its rationale. Whereas humans may
not necessarily know like how they're
evaluating and there's all sorts of
unconscious subtle biases at play.
Whereas the AI will tell you exactly why
it thinks a person's a fit, why it's not
a fit and it doesn't have really
anything to hide.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The analog there is like Whimo
versus a human driver, right? Like Whimo
is obviously way safer than humans, but
it's probably still going to get in
accidents. It's eventually going to kill
somebody, but it's going to be at such a
smaller rate. But because it's a robot,
we're a very we're very uncomfortable
with that. Right.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. Yeah. A question I get a
lot um from folks is both internal
companies like Taisy and also external
like to your customers is there should
be an element of human something on top
of it right like the question is is this
 
someone on my team kind of edit this
look at it QA it do you all have any
human interventions at Taisy to help you
with this yeah that's kind of something
that I think people are a little
&gt;&gt; confused about out there with the
emergence of all these tools.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it's a good call out. One key
point is that like Max, our AI agent, it
doesn't make any decisions like in terms
of advance or reject. All it does is
provide recommendations. And so it would
say this person seems like a fit and
should advance. This person does not
seem like a fit. But ultimately a human
is always making the call to advance or
reject when it comes to any type of
stage. One is like the laws in some
jurisdictions, but two, we just think
safer and better for everybody right now
is to have that sort of second line QA
done by humans.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.
&gt;&gt; I saw two things on LinkedIn today
around these like one-way dynamic AI
based interviews. So the idea here is
kind of a similar problem set. So many
applicants at the top end of the funnel,
nobody's looking at the bucket. How do
we actually go in and qualify? Yeah.
some of these solutions. Now, Wall
Street Journal had an article today
which was like your interview is now
with AI and so you go through you fill
out the application, you submit your
resume and then at some point in time
you're met with a link which takes you
to this AI based interview.
&gt;&gt; Uh the person who I saw on LinkedIn
today actually like walked back their
experiment was like hey it didn't work
which surprised me. What's your take on
that aspect of introducing AI at the top
of the funnel in an interview format?
Well, we've created Max to have
screening capabilities, which is
comparable to the recruiter phone screen
in what it tries to cover, which is a
level of just kind of pre-qualification
before the team spends time with this
person. Let's try and get some of the
basics out of the way of work
eligibility, your work location
preferences, compensation, why are you
on the market, and then the candidate
gets a chance to get their questions
asked and answered on whatever's top of
mind for them. If it's things like
what's the team size, what's your
fundraising or your last fundraising
round, these types of things. And so the
company will provide context and then
Max can answer those questions for
candidates. Now, we don't think it's all
that evaluative, like most candidates
will pass that session, but it does help
bring more color to these applicants and
weed out the ones that just like clearly
cannot work here because they don't have
certain qualifications. We predominantly
work right now in the tech industry and
we think that's the right application.
Whereas, you get deeper into the
process, passive candidates especially,
they want to interact with humans. It's
a birectional evaluation of like do I
actually want to work here? Do I want to
work with these people? And so I think
it's in the company's interest to have a
person on the other end. Now there's
probably lower consideration industries
where you could have AI doing more of
the interviewing, but that's not the
space that we operate in. And I don't
think that's going to be true. Yeah. In
the tech industry for some I don't know
for many years, we'll say.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It feels like in order for it to
be true, it could only work for inbound
applicants. And you really have to
explain why this is better for the
candidate experience. But it's such a
behavior change right now that I feel
like most companies are very scared of
introducing that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So with our solution, it gets most
often applied to the inbound applicants.
Very few are screening their source
candidates. And for the inbound
applicants, let's say there were 3,000
that came through. Max says about a
hundred of them are a fit. Then they go
through screening and okay, actually 40
clear this screening because one some
dropped out because they didn't even
complete it and then some complete it.
And so then they get 40 candidates that
are like, okay, yeah, these seem
pre-qualified. We're interested in a
person spending time with these folks
when that would have been zero
otherwise. And it's trying to make that
clear for both parties that like you're
deriving value where there wouldn't have
been value derived.
&gt;&gt; Are you stack ranking those people?
&gt;&gt; Not presently. So it would just be based
on who completes the screening and then
once the screening is completed then it
would be okay max recommends or doesn't
recommend but a human reviews that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it's like chronological
based off of when they apply.
&gt;&gt; Got it. And Nolan, you mentioned kind of
a lot of folks are scared of
implementing, right? [clears throat]
This I I I also get a lot of questions
on a lot of folks are feeling
overwhelmed and excited, but also
overwhelmed at all the AI tools across
recruiting that are popping up, Jason,
like
&gt;&gt; how do you think about that? And then I
get, you know, talk to founders, well,
it's a race. You know, all these all
these tools are somewhat similar. or
maybe they ven diagram overlap but it is
it's a race to see who can kind of
figure this out first and get to market
and I'm hearing that in different
industries whether it's legal tech or
recruiting or this or AI h how would you
help the audience think about that and
how do you think about that
&gt;&gt; it is a very difficult environment both
as I guess an offer of services to
differentiate as well as for a buyer to
figure out signal from noise our
strategy where we differentiate will We
try to be more all-in-one than point
solution. And that's hard to execute
with a high quality bar is to be like
good across like many features, but
companies seem to have little tolerance
right now for adding point solutions.
And so we tried to be pretty holistic.
And then we we skew towards like
automation and agentic labor more than
co-pilot. Now, we have backed into some
co-pilot features, but we are a solution
for those that are really feeling like
underwater. They're have way too much to
do, too little time to do it, and they
need capacity on their recruiting labor.
Whereas, if you're just looking for like
 
a human recruiter's workflow, gosh,
there's dozens, maybe hundreds of tools
right now that can probably achieve
that. So, it's a tough environment,
&gt;&gt; but but I I want to agree. I don't know
if you agree, Nolan, but the all-in-one
the all-in-one differentiator, it's
always been like that for me. Like, I
remember talking to a founder back in
 
analytics HR platform, and I said,
listen, the person who figures out how
to help me do end to end with the least
amount of tools as possible wins.
The reason why that's true, Kelly, is
because people, it's easier typically,
like especially with an ATS, it's a
system of record, and so you want your
system of record to be like the thing
that you're going back to all the time
and things that are working on top of
it. The challenge is, as Jason
mentioned, it's hard to be really good
at many different things. And then the
other challenge is is like you know
Microsoft famously bundles and we'll get
you in on a cheap discount and then you
know when renewal comes up it becomes a
lot more expensive and typically down
the road if you're growing as a company
now your challenge is is like well god
it's going to take forever to offboard
and implement something new and so I
think about this challenge all the time
I talk to friends about it I'm currently
in the camp of because primarily where
AI is today of experimenting with
everything and seeing what's going on
with everything and just hoping at one
point in time somebody could come in and
be the all-in-one. But I mean Jason, I
mean, how hard is that? Like you guys
are early stage. Like that's got to be
like impossible.
&gt;&gt; It's quite hard. Yeah. So we hire almost
exclusively staff and senior staff level
engineers. We give them whatever AI that
they want to be able to add capacity for
them. But yeah, it's the challenge.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it. So Athena, we're a
compliance company which uh let's just
put it out there that sounds pretty
boring if you think about it right okay
harassment prevention training not very
exciting right we are very lucky in that
we are in the HR tech space that's
required right harassment prevention
training is not really optional you need
it the question is who are you going to
use for it
&gt;&gt; exactly you're doing this training
whether you want to or not but here's
what she told us about the impact
&gt;&gt; the amount of impact that I've been able
to have from the HR perspective has been
just huge huge. It's phenomenal. We're
doing all these amazing things that
quite frankly too many companies don't
do because they don't understand the
power of their HR team.
&gt;&gt; Instead of boring check the box training
that everyone hates, Athena delivers
content that's modern and impactful.
We're talking 200 plus courses in 100
plus languages with a 93% learner
positivity rating to back it up. They
take on all the tough topics, harassment
prevention, workplace violence
prevention, code of conduct, and make
them actually engaging. And for HR, it's
effortless. Training runs on autopilot
with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
done right, like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.

&gt;&gt; All right. So, in I went again, as I
mentioned, I went deep on your podcast
and in one you said RC's and sorcers
find something else. And the reason why
you said that I believe is because you
think scheduling is going to be solved
in the next couple of years and sourcing
is not going to be a role. I tend to
agree with that. But how do you think
about growing this like next generation
of recruiters? Like I came up I started
as a recruiting coordinator. That's if I
didn't have that entry level role,
there's no way that I'm doing this right
now with all of my time. How do you
think about that challenge?
&gt;&gt; I guess how you represented my point of
view is accurate. And I'm not saying
that it's necessarily Tazy that like
wins and you know does all of sourcing
and all of recruiting coordination. It's
just I recognize that technology is
close to being able to just do this
better than you know any human. And so
given that to answer your question how
do you envision the future for full life
cycle recruiters? Do you think that
there are more or fewer? I think there
are fewer.
&gt;&gt; Five years
&gt;&gt; fewer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I don't know that the
entrylevel rules will exist in that if
you have a bunch of mid-level senior
full cycle recruiters struggling to find
fewer jobs, you need the entry-level
roles if you believe that there's
continued growth in in the field, which
I I question. That said, also to me it
seems like the entry level stuff already
went away in that it's largely what I've
seen moved offshore and it's like
Athenas doing the jobs now in Kenya and
the Philippines rather than like
full-timers. So, if there's going to be
an entrylevel role, it's going to have
to probably be an entry-level full cycle
recruiter. I just don't think that
there'll be that many. And this isn't a
problem exclusive to recruiting. We see
it, you know, in engineering. It's
happening in product management. It's
happening in sales. And it's a really
tough time to be a new grad. I think
&gt;&gt; to do as well as I'd like in my past
experiences. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah, I think that'll be like each CHRO
will make their own choice as to like,
okay, would I rather repurpose this head
with the same person? Um,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; but I think they'll have more
flexibility in their budgets because
like
&gt;&gt; that's the point and software can kind
of like trade off against each other
now.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's kind of what I've
been kind of screaming from the rooftops
is people like, "Well, my job's going to
go away." And my thing, it's like, "No,
it just changes because now we can kind
of do all these things." So, I offer
that because that's how I've been
thinking about this the past, you know,
few months. I so I talked to my buddy
Evan Connors at Ambience and him and I
are I think working on a hypothesis
together about I actually think there's
a ton of alpha to be had at the new grad
level because like these kids are coming
out native in AI. They have to get
really really scrappy like a lot
scrappier than we were given the
constraints in the job market. And so
you really have like your pick of the
litter on them. And if you do design
something like you know call it a
rotational program or something to where
like these people can come in and try
different aspects of the business. I
feel like actually that might be a a
path in the future. We did this at
Google. We had rotation programs. It was
typically within people ops, but I
actually think now it's going to be like
across the entire business and then
somebody can come back into recruiting
and have like the full business context
because not only did they do recruiting,
they went and like were an STR and did
some other things. So that's where I
think it's ultimately going. Um, but
it's to your point, Jason, like you're
only hiring senior engineers.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And that is uh that's it's an easy lever
to go to because they need less
coaching.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we've been debating and
considering hiring junior because of
what you mentioned where it's like,
okay, we're like a 15 person seed stage
startup. It would be hard to compete for
the top 1 to 10% of talent from the new
grad population in 2021.
Now, there might be more top talent
that's less competitive because fewer
people are hiring. So maybe now is a
good time to try to pick up some of them
because they're still just as talented
as they were. It's just I guess less
demand for their services.
&gt;&gt; That's exactly it. That's exactly it. So
I listened to your Harry Stings pod
which you had some banger quotes out of
that one. One was people with great
resumes often rode the elevator up. What
do you mean by that? Okay. So, there's
businesses that
are formed that
were always going to be successful
because they're riding some long-term
secular trend that it's technology wave.
So, think like, okay, with the cloud and
mobile paradigm shift, there was always
going to be a business like Uber. There
was always going to be a business like
Spotify. And whether you know Uber or
Lift one, that was up for debate, but
there was always going to be some like
taxi app on your phone. And so that
elevator is going up. People that work
at that company during those time
periods, they can be potentially just
riding that elevator and benefiting from
the company success and it shows up as
resume success for them. or they could
actually alter and support the
trajectory of that company. They could
be the key contributors to the company's
success. It's often hard to disambiguate
those two things. I've seen founders get
themselves in trouble by just like being
like, "Oh, great resume." Like they were
at this company during this time during
hyperrowth and this company during that
time. And then you find out like this
person I don't know can't even like put
together a coherent plan or roadmap or
strategy and it's like it's just tough
to learn that on you know a year into
making that key higher. We've talked
about this so many times, Nolan, right?
Like the like the worry of pedigree,
right? Halo resume writing coat tales of
Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; So, so Jason, how do you then like, you
know, if you dismbiguates the word that
you used, how do you think about
assessing these people and understanding
if they were actually part of the core
contribution or not?
you find with people that are I guess
very good and very integral one there's
like a level of depth to like any answer
that they're giving you like you can
kind of keep digging and they are able
to deliver at the 40,000 10,000 like 100
ground level like they know it in and
out and can speak to like all of that
with clarity that means that they were
like really in the thick of it which is
helpful to sus out.
I find that back channels are just
invaluable. Like go talk to a bunch of
people that they worked with, both the
ones they introduced you to as well as
ones that they haven't, and ask around
what did they do? How did they
contribute? Do you think it like really
mattered for the outcome of the company?
And if so, like how? And you get a bunch
of valuable signal from that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was just like chilling in the
audience. I don't know if any of you are
thinking this right now, but I was just
thinking like when is Max going to be
able to to tell me that.
&gt;&gt; I would love that. Yeah, [laughter] we
got some like I guess more foundational
stuff, but [laughter]
I do think like AI could be quite good
at that. Like reference checks and back
channels and stuff like that. Who knows
who? Uh and like
&gt;&gt; set up a schedule, schedule a call with
them at least.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; cuz that's like the dream, right? When
can Max just put three people on my
doorstep that are perfect for me and
this company at this period of time,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; 100%. So, St. Pod, you mentioned that at
Instacart you were working 100hour weeks
and that 72 hours a week was kind of
stasis.
&gt;&gt; Like, isn't that a bit much? Like, did
is that really true?
&gt;&gt; That is really true. Yeah, it's not that
hard to get to 72 hours. I I'd mentioned
that because this 996 culture stuff,
like that's, you know, 72 hours a week.
So, for me, it was like work from 6:00
a.m. to 6:00 p.m. 5 days a week. Then a
couple nights, hop back online, work for
a few hours, you know, one or two nights
a week, and then like a half day on
Sunday, Sunday morning or something. Or
work fewer nights, but work all day
Sunday. And like it's not great. I'm not
saying it's like fun or feels good or
it's good for my relationships, but it
is common and it's pretty unremarkable
and often expected. And so the thing
with the 996 is that people wear it like
a badge of honor when
back in my day like it just was called
working at a startup.
&gt;&gt; Is it like Okay, so there's two pieces.
Well, one is Kelly, have you heard of
 
&gt;&gt; Like the movie?
&gt;&gt; No. 12:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. 7 days a
week,
&gt;&gt; you know? No, Nolan. No, I haven't heard
of that.
&gt;&gt; All the hours.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, it's like all It was I
actually like laughed at that one. I
thought it was good. But like
&gt;&gt; how do you pitch that to candidates?
&gt;&gt; Because you know ultimately like you
know I got kids. I actually think like
I'm phased out of the startup era
especially early stage because I have
kids. But how do you how do you
communicate that? And then the second
piece, isn't it about outputs? Like
isn't outputs the thing that we're
actually measuring here?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, we're not a 996
culture like that's not I was just kind
of like ragging on all that really
matters is the outcomes. And so, I don't
care how many hours like people work to
do it. Like I said, then was we have the
this fractional PM that puts in 15 hours
a week and it's better than many of the
PMs I've worked with at 50 hours a week.
And I'm entirely happy like with that.
It's like having a full-timer, but he
just gets it done faster because he's
very, very good. I think that's
ultimately what matters. The way we set
expectations, or at least try to with
our folks, though, is we're going to try
and work smart and so be focused, try to
make decisions quickly, try to, you
know, execute with f Yeah. with clarity.
But we're also going to work hard and
everybody will have sort of their time
at being like five out of five busy for
our standups. That's one of the things
is that we check in on is like what did
you do? What are you going to do? And
then sustainability. There's like a
scale of one to five. What are you at?
And three out of five is like this is
sustainable. I could do this forever.
Four out of five is like this isn't very
sustainable but it's okay. And then five
out of five is like this is not
sustainable at all. It is impinging on
like my quality of life and well-being.
Everybody has their five out of five
moments but like you should be there
briefly like you know a couple weeks a
year tops.
&gt;&gt; I love that.
&gt;&gt; I have so many thoughts on 996 Nolan.
Like we should do a segment on 996 or
 
But like I think I completely agree
Jason. I would talk to any leader that,
you know, for those leaders who are all
touting 996 and 007, when you find
someone that is like incredible and the
outcomes are impeccable and they're not
doing that, they don't say a peep.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just founder porn. It's
totally founder porn. They just love to
to talk about it. All right. So, last
quote from that same stabbing spot,
which was awesome. and you guys should
totally listen to it is you said that
the best culture is growth because
growth solves morale and retention and
culture only matters when growth slows.
I totally agree. Molly Graham came on
our podcast said the exact same thing.
Said the best culture is winning. What
like what's your take on this and
elaborate further please?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think that's well recaped. I
think it's important to invest in
culture. So, I want to be clear about
that because you don't know when the
growth is going to slow or hit a wall
and completely stop. But at the end of
the day, like the company needs to be
growing like above all because folks
need a path. They need progression in
their careers and they need to feel like
their equity is going to be worth
something. they need to. And so it's
crazy how much like growth covers sort
of like a multitude of sins and solves
nearly all problems. But yeah, that
said, I would advise every founder to at
least put in some of effort on culture,
to be talking about it, to like be
intentional about it because what keeps
people in the hard times will be the
bonds that they have with one another
and their like attachment to the
company, the mission, the vision, that
sort of thing. How are you guys thinking
about that right now given that you're
you know obviously 15 people seed stage
it's an insanely competitive market you
know what like what what's the pitch and
how do you hook me with your culture
&gt;&gt; the people that join us tend to join
because the way that we are articulated
our like values some of them kind of
stand out and resonate so one of which
is like committed to calm and so by that
we don't mean we're super chill
but that we will be calm and focused and
deliberate. We will avoid thrash and
chaos and we will be as steady as one
can be in this sort of journey even
though we will work with like intensity.
So for folks that have been through very
volatile situations, that's attractive.
And that comes from myself and my
co-founder being old founders.
Basically, I'm in my 40s, he's in his
 
stuff. And so there's a level of like
resilience that we can bring and calm to
the storm that that we can bring. So we
try to differentiate on that. We're
committed to like a team of adults and
by that we mean we will provide trust
and freedom to our team and then we
expect sort of wise judgment and
thoughtfulness about you know what the
business needs and so there's this like
mutual respect and trust and freedom and
responsibility very like Netflixy in
that regard and so these types of things
tend to resonate with the folks that
come join us.
&gt;&gt; I love that.
&gt;&gt; Also, at our stage, like we've mostly
built from like the allstars of our
network.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then there's already built-in
trust, but I mean I Kelly and I talk
about this all the time that you
ultimately culture should serve as a
magnet for the people that you want to
attract and a deterrent for the people
you want to avoid. Right? So what when
you say those things to me, what I
experience is is like a very mature
adult workplace to where when problems
happen, you know, we're not just like
pointing fingers or scrambling, like
we're being thoughtful about how we
solve them
&gt;&gt; and thoughtful in our communication,
which I think is attractive to most
adults,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The thing I would add there, it's,
you know, it's also glue for the company
when things don't go great, you know,
and I think I was going to call call it
out and you already said it, Jason, is
is by no means were you saying not to
invest in culture because that's the
glue that holds it together when when
kind of goes sideways as well,
&gt;&gt; which always does.
 always does. But yeah, what I found
though is like if you optimize for
culture directly, what you end up doing
is kind of playing whack-a-ole on like
employee complaints if you're not
growing. And so what you want to be
doing is you get as a, you know, the
highest level leaders, the business
needs to be growing and succeeding and
then you kind of knock off the like top
complaints here and there.
&gt;&gt; Totally.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yep. 100%. So what's next on the TA road
map and where can people find you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So what's next for us? We are
launching a beta of a self-s served tier
of our product. We've been salesled
historically and so we're collecting
beta signups. If anybody wants to
participate, let's just have them DM me
on any platform. So I'm on Twitter or X
as Jason Daisy. You can find me on
LinkedIn as Jason James. and we'd be
happy to put companies into our beta as
we're getting ready to launch and go big
with this in a few months.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Jason, thank you so much for the time,
man. This was a blast.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Really appreciate it. Thank you both.
