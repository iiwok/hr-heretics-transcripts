# Airbnb’s Iain Roberts on Designing HR as a Strategic Service Function

## Transcript

 
[Applause]
[Music]
 
what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today we
have Ian Roberts on the show and Ian you
have a very interesting background
you're a designer by trade you worked at
idio for like 15 20 years something like
that you ended up working at Ford for a
little while mostly you were operating
on the product and design side and then
in
 
and culture can you help us understand
like how does one go from a design
background into leading people in
culture at Airbnb yeah for sure it's
been a journey but I think if I go all
the way back right I remember parent
teacher conversation where my mom and my
dad were sat down with my art teacher
and he said to them hey what are you
going to do with this kid he's I was
taking maths and physics and art at the
time as my a levels in the UK and my art
teacher said to my mom and dad
everything needs to be designed and that
idea of everything needs to be designed
kind of like stuck with me for the last
 
to University to become an engineer and
then going to Art School to actually
exercise my desire to be a designer
through to yeah 25 years as a practicing
designer I would say that the the first
half of my my time as a designer I spent
a lot of time working with technology
companies Legacy companies designing the
stuff right designing the product or the
service all the digital experience that
they were trying to ship out into the
world designed cars and cell phones and
Hospitality experiences you name it and
then the second half of my my career in
the design profession was asking the
question why is it so difficult
for organizations to get those new ideas
through themselves and out into the
world and so for that second decade I
spent much more
time designing how organizations work
and actually figuring out how they can
get new ideas through their structures
to deliver new growth and new innovation
out into the world and so it's a little
bit of the Journey of like designing
from designing things to designing
organizations and uh when Brian and the
team initially called me from Ab at ABNB
in 2020 3 it definitely took me by
surprise in a weird way I'd considered
what I was doing a design practice but I
hadn't really considered the place to do
it was from the seat of HR and it took a
lot of conversations between Brian and
myself and the executive team to truly
believe they were committed to this idea
but when that light bulb went off and
Brian and I bonded over the idea of
Designing the organization together it
felt like a natural fit I love that
everything needs to be designed designed
and if I ask let's say 10 people that I
might get seven different answers and
I'd love to hear your answer on that Ian
like what does that mean in in your head
what does it mean it means that things
don't happen by accident right it means
that we're constantly shaping the
environment and the systems around us
whether or not we're designing a product
or a service at the end of the day it is
a conscious Act of shaping people
Systems and Technology to try and get
the outcome that you want and so you can
take that idea and I think you can play
it out in a more traditional setting how
do we get people to organize together to
bend sheet metal and like design
software so that we design a new car or
we can start to think about it truly
from the organizational sense and if you
think about it ebnb is just 7,000 people
right the classic idea that like we're
we're a very Capital like company all we
have is 7,000 people and so the design
effort here is designing the system of
the right people working on the right
things in the right way in the right
organizational structures that's the
entire ball game it's a massive and a
huge design Challenge and one that I'm
incredibly privileged to have the
opportunity to work on yeah so you've
been at it now at Airbnb for about a
year and a half and I can imagine if I
was like at Airbnb in an HR recruiting
role seeing you announced as the leader
being like what the hell is Brian
thinking so how have you like number one
won the hearts and minds of the people
who have been doing this work for a long
time and then I think the second thing
is you know what has been surprising to
you just making this gigantic career
transition yeah and such good questions
I think there was definitely a bit of a
sticker shock right in terms of like
again yeah what there's a there's a
person coming in to leave the function
and not from an HR background it Al I
think didn't add up to a lot of people
internally and externally but I have
learned that the way that Brian wants to
approach this problem like the people
problem the people opportunity in amnb
is innately a creative and designed one
right and so year one of my work in that
organization has been to try and bring
creative problem solving approaches into
what we call ex our people in culture or
our employee experience team to help the
team understand that best practi
practices is always a foundation and a
baseline from which we can build new
thinking to really solve the problems
that we're seeing out in the business
and so like a lot of the work that we've
done in the first year has actually been
really thinking about how we can solve
problems differently as a people and
culture team and begin to really help
them understand that we are here as a
service function yes but we need to be a
strategic service function that is
shaping how the organization
evolves is designed the the talent and
the capabilities that built within it so
it's been a lot of that that that
journey of trying to like build the
confidence and the courage in the team
build some of the capability so that we
can act as a much more strategic set of
advisers to our executive clients your
question about what's maybe most
surprising has been actually how
transferable my Consulting skills were
from 22 years of being a design
consultant or in that last decade being
much more in the transformation side of
things so much of what I need to do on a
day-to-day basis is advise our executive
team my peers to help them understand
what needs to change in order that we
can be fit for the future and a lot of
what I did spent the last 10 years doing
is very applicable even though I've
never done it inside of a technology
company before and then maybe the last
thing I'll add is I'm learning a lot of
new stuff as well like clearly there is
a ton of craft real craft in the HR
space that is often invisible right and
I'm having to actually learn I think the
the practice of great HR at the same
time and the good news there is I have a
really strong bench who knows how to do
that already and my hope is that what
we're able to do is add the two parts of
our capability set together and create
something kind of new and interesting in
the future talk to me a little bit about
top down versus bottom up design
thinking so specifically what I'm
getting at is is Airbnb is 7,000 people
is right I can imagine you know you and
Brian in the lab cooking up ideas on how
you want the culture to operate I can
also Imagine team a does things one way
and Team B does it an entirely different
way how do you think about like the top
down of what the executive team wants
versus like what might be best for each
team individually I've been wrestling
with that one for sure maybe I'll start
by saying like maybe just describing how
some of the consistent structures work
at Airbnb so 7,000 people organized into
quite a pure functional design
functional organizational structure we
have a single product team a single
design team a single engineering team
there are no GMS it's all a number of
supervisory functions all working
towards one road map that's what's quite
unique about Airbnb 7,000 people all
working on one road map where we're
launching new feature upgrades new
services to our guest and host Community
once every six months so that gives you
like a a way of organizing and a meter
and a focus that's quite quite unheard
of actually in many of the organizations
that I've consulted with in the past
right so that top down this that Brian
has imposed on the road map the one road
map I think works incredibly well to
make sure that we're all very focused on
what we're trying to execute the next
half and the next half and the next half
at the same time though I really believe
that change in an organization happens
through movements not just mandates
right and so to your point about bottom
up you really do need to acknowledge
that there's great Innovation happening
in the functions in the teams and a lot
of my job is to shine a light right on
the the amazing work that's happening in
different pockets of the organization
and where applicable pick it up and
figure out how can we influence people
to scale great ideas across the
organization because it's not a man
because we've seen and demonstrated its
success somewhere else and so for me
it's always a blend between the two of
like just enough top down to give you
structure to give you scaffolding from
which you can operate and an
acknowledgement that actually you need
to bring along a movement you need to
bring along a culture in order to affect
change over time that sticks and also
that's where Innovation can come from
too right like by letting people Test
new things we can then take those
learnings and apply them in a more broad
setting absolutely and when I talk about
Innovation I think about it really
broadly there's the Innovation on the
product side for sure but Innovation is
full stack right it's down to how we
innovate our service delivery in the
people and culture function how our
Global operations teams innovates on
customer service is there's room for it
across the entire Enterprise it's not
just about the products that we're
shipping to our guests and our hosts
yeah I'm just thinking about those that
are listening right and I think I think
this is
so it's cool right not a lot of
companies are talking about this or
approach it this way and so my my
question Ian is how did you tactically
wrap the HR team's head around this just
because the organizations I've worked
with and I work with now you know and
advise for this is not for most of them
you know the way that they just approach
things so what did you do when you came
in h how did you take those first steps
at the gate with them a lot of
listening right I think many people
might say I'm maybe a little slower
moving than they might have expected
because I don't have a playbook for this
right it's not like I've done this three
times before and I'm rolling out the
Playbook from years and years of
experience to say this is the right way
to transform what we are now into what
we need to be in the future so the only
way I know how to do that is to do the
research right like design and research
go hand in hand creative problem solving
requires you to have an innate sense of
curiosity and empathy for like what are
the real problems that we need to solve
and I'd say for my first 90 days I was
very much in listening and learning mode
to identify where were we where do we
have gaps and I mean that as a people
and culture function but also as an
organization and where were the
opportunities to lean into and design in
those spaces year one was about putting
the foundations in place so back to this
idea of I don't have a Playbook year one
is putting the foundations in place year
two that we're just entering into now
I'm talking a lot to my team about the
idea of us delivering products and
services internally right so if Airbnb
is a Ser is a product and a service that
delivers to guests and hosts in the
world and we are very product and design
driven as an organization how can we
take that same philosophy into people
and culture and really ask ourselves the
question what are our products and
services that we're delivering where do
they need to be high Touch where can
they be automated where can software be
part of the delivery mechanism where
does it need to be a person and how can
we orchestrate the service that we're
delivering to the organization to truly
solve employees and leaders needs in a
way that the HR function hasn't done
before yeah I was on a panel a few
months ago and we were talking about Ai
and people teams and the work and how
that shifts and I threw it out there I
said look I wouldn't be surprised if
there's a new job title in the people
function it's it's a people product
manager or something like that and do
you have one of those I mean you might
have one of those now I have you thought
about that because I haven't seen it yet
but I could definitely see a new career
path around HR product management I
completely agree with you it's a
conversation we've like my leadership
team and I have begun treading into I
sent there was there was a there was an
article posted on I guess on LinkedIn
recently by Jensen hang from the Nvidia
CEO talking about how it was going to
become the people product management
team of the future because AI
agents and I sent that around to my team
and I was like let's debate this what do
we think about that and for me we have
to be charting new territory in that
space we have to be like being bold
enough to say we're going to
fundamentally think about how product
management inside the
HR or people function will need to
evolve so that we can deliver kind of
like frankly deliver against customer
expectations and our client expectations
so we're doing the things you'd expect
us to be doing we've already delivered
some basic AI agent kind of Bot like
infrastructure that allows us to solve
very simple tickets and we're building a
road map that will allow us to like
build on that capability over time I'm
excited to see where this goes and I
don't think anybody right now knows
because quite a fractured Marketplace so
I think anybody who's at the edges in
experimenting is we should all be
learning from each other
yep hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview and
I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards metaview changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and T leaders can finally take
control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out medavie head over to metav
view. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
metav VI's product experts tell them
that me and Kelly sent you or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free you'll be up running and AI
enabled in minutes
so let's talk a little bit about Brian's
comments regarding founder mode and I
actually think a lot of these comments
got taken way out of context so I'll
give you my read and then I would love
to hear your read so my read of what he
said to Paul Graham was essentially the
traditional advice when you hire an
executive is you hire that person and
then you just get out of their way and
you let them operate and then they tell
you what they're doing Brian's view on
that traditional advice is that it's
broken and it's broken because they can
be off doing stuff that you're not aware
of and you're misaligned with but
because they run such large swats of the
organization it can start feeling like
that part of the organization is
drifting into a direction that is not in
the same direction as the rest of the
company and so Brian's also talked a
little bit about being in the details
and I think this ties in together with
founder mode which is essentially he's
saying trust and verify right which is I
give you a mandate we're aligned on the
Mandate and then as you keep working I
basically have spot checks to make sure
that what we had agreed on initially is
still true today and as it becomes into
reality that's exactly what's going on
here do I have that right or what am I
what am I wrong about as it relates to
the way Brian thinks about founder it's
a much debated topic right for sure and
I think it has been a much
misinterpreted topic right I think one
of the things Brian talks about is this
idea that leadership should be defined
in in its presence not in its absence
and for me what I found in working with
Brian perhaps not surprisingly is he
leads like a designer right and so at
the heart for me personally in my
experiences with Brian he leads like a
designer what does that mean it means he
is highly collaborative in the way he
wants to work through
problems right because innately in
design is this idea of interdisciplinary
collaboration teams always being better
at getting to the outcome that you want
than anyone individual it's like so
deeply rooted into design practice
design education and you can see it in
the way that I I can see it in the way
that Brian
leads and that can
be challenging to some people right who
are used to being given the autonomy and
the mandate to go off and do the thing
and bring back the
whereas actually how I found Brian
really wants to work is he genuinely
wants to roll up his sleeves and sit
down next to you and work through
problems together and that's what it
means to be in the details and so the
idea Nolan of like frequent iteration
touch points that you're talking about
that's a design practice as well it's
called prototyping and iterating
prototyping and iterating and so my
experience of working with Brian is
exactly that how do I get to be at the
same side of the table as him with my
sleeves rolled up collaborating on
problems together and then actually
using his immense capacity to problem
solve across all avenues of the business
and use that to my
benefit so that we're consistently
advancing our thinking and lock step
it's a different way of working for many
Executives it feels very familiar to me
Nolan that seems very different that
that explanation seems extremely far
away from what you
explained founder mode to be and not
this is not about you but what I'm
hearing out in the wild which is kind of
like like we do with values at companies
like weaponizing this thing I'm gonna go
into founder mode like that is a very
different explanation yeah you're
talking about micromanaging right and
and so this one's been in the oven for a
little while for me since it came out
and I think Kelly you and I both had a
very extreme adverse reaction to how it
was being weaponized and the
weaponization is
micromanagement right it's like the CEO
is up your ass and around the corner on
every single thing trust isn't
established and they like you know in
the details as Brian says is not just
like Hey we're aligning every week on
this thing and we're working on problems
together it's like I'm looking over your
shoulder when you're doing the work and
Ian what I'm hearing from you is is
actually like no no no this is just a
modern way of management right so in
instead of I think the the Antiquated
way of management was we hire Ian I get
out of his way I never bother him I
never like see what he's doing and I
just like trust it's happening and then
six months later I'm like holy Ian
what have you been
doing versus like now we're having a
more established Cadence and a more a
Cadence that is part of the expectation
for how how Executives work here is that
right yeah I I don't I don't want to
comment on how how people are using
misusing or interpretate interpreting
found mode for themselves to their own
benefit right into their own through
their own goals but I totally see your
point that micromanagement right it's
very easy to jump to the conclusion that
therefore I need to make every decision
on everything and I literally need to do
the work and you're just my hands right
and it doesn't feel like that doesn't
feel like that to me here right and I
think that's the beauty in in in when
it's done well how it feels to truly be
able to get to better outcomes together
because you're actually working on the
problem together as opposed to talking
about or presenting findings or
recommendations there's a real
difference it sounds nuanced there's a
real difference between working on the
problem together and then presenting
your findings to the CEO and like I I'm
I'm always firmly in the former Camp
right as opposed to the latter I just I
just love talking about this because it
accents for me I mean something I've
seen in Tech you know in my 25 years and
doing this is how it can quickly become
this this convoluted thing after a long
game of telephone and going back to the
original intent of this
versus how it can be taken and then used
and and for me it wasn't even
micromanaging noan it was more I'm in F
almost like beast mode I'm in founder
mode I'm gonna kind of do all these
things and I have agency to do that and
it's just interesting that it was the
exact opposite in in collaboration
actually may maybe I'll I'll add as well
though that you know even the idea of
having a single product road map with
 
goals delivered on a deadline we say
we're going to deliver it which is how
we operate which is not how practically
any other software company operates pure
software company operates right or
Marketplace company operates that for me
is just another great example of how
Brian's using the management systems
he's got to his his fingertips to kind
of Drive the intensity we need right to
be really successful we don't we we
don't just launch when ready and iterate
out in the wild like many other software
companies we are conscious of the notion
that every summer every fall we have a
big release those releases should add up
to something so that they are noticeable
and meaningful to the market and it
requires a different way of working in a
different level of intensity to really
pull that off with Excellence yeah but
that's a new practice right Ian like
that's like that was something that
Brian's come up with recently and I
guess where my curiosity goes there is
what caused that change like why did he
want to make that change to where you're
doing the entire company is aligned to
one product road map with two releases a
year yeah I mean I obviously wasn't
there so I can't comment on the
specifics but before the pandemic Airbnb
had grown incredibly quickly and was
organized in a more traditional GM
structure where you had a GM of of
different service lines or different
business lines in the organization and I
think Brian's been quite vocal about the
idea that he felt like he was losing
control of where was Airbnb going and
what was it becoming and so the
leadership that he exhibited to get and
of course with the founders as well and
the rest of the executive team to
navigate this organization
through the pandemic when everybody said
is this the end of Airbnb to an
radically successful IPO to then this
idea of we got to organize differently
to get our house in order to ensure that
our foundational product works
exceptionally well and then we can build
on top of that earn the right actually
earn the right to do the things that we
want to do in the future around growth
right that was a new thing in in 2021
it's a new invention in the organization
that's only three four years old now
right so we're learning our way into it
I think you can see if you look at
actually what we launch every half you
can see that the scale of the ambition
is getting bigger and Bolder every six
months I think something along the lines
of we've launched 535 product upgrades
in this new model over the last four or
five years so you know it's it's it's
working for us to be able to actually
take effectively the same size
organization
and deliver much more with it over time
but it is a new invention and as you
mentioned Nolan like every half we're
reflecting upon what's working how high
can we set the bar on our ambition on
the next half what do we need to do to
be able to deliver that and it's
thrilling to be in the middle of it it
reminds me a little bit of Apple so when
Steve Jobs ran the company right the
iPhone was released every year in
September and there'd be this big event
and this big roll out and then the new
product would come out and the entire
company knew this is what we're working
on for the course of the next year the
other thing which I think is interesting
with Brian is that you know Johnny I who
is famously the designer at Apple has
reportedly been working with you guys
and working with Brian and so I'm
curious like how how much influence does
like the old Apple culture have on Brian
I think Brian is Brian's creative
the Airbnb way of doing things for sure
so I think it's easy on the outside to
look and say well there's some simple um
connections you can make between Airbnb
and Johnny or Airbnb and apple but
there's influence in this organization
from many many many other aspects as
well if you think about the kinds of
things we we tried to build in the last
five to six years the things we're
building for the future at the moment so
this definitely elements of
organizational Theory and organizational
culture that I see from different types
of companies kind of like across not
just the tech sphere but beyond the tech
sphere into entertainment and Beyond but
that's the magic of this opportunity
noan is the fact that we're getting to
actually describe the Airbnb way of
doing it and so you know I worked with
apple in a Consulting capacity way back
when at Ido the Apple culture had a lot
of similarities to the Ido culture maybe
not surprisingly because both David
Kelly and Steve Jobs were very very very
close friends they were together when
Apple was kind of like producing the
first computers for me what's more
familiar in this organization is that it
is a design Le organization and it's
truly got design in its DNA and I don't
just mean we care about what the product
looks like or how the product
works like the details matter how you do
anything is how you do everything right
and so that idea of like attention to
detail and the design of the experience
is innately part of who Airbnb is and My
Hope right is that we'll have people in
the future saying they're trying to copy
how we've worked right because it's been
so radically successful as a model for
innovating as a model for customer
centricity and as a model for really
showing what design can do in a modern
technology organization Ian you said
something a few minutes ago or earlier
prototyping and iterating right which is
a big piece of this and just to stay
true to the the heretic's name here and
thinking about some of the Devil's
Advocate doing that with a product you
know a thing a service is one thing
prototyping and iterating with human
experiences right people's jobs their
pay their the I mean that can be a
little bit more difficult right in high
stakes so H have you run into any of
those you know challenges because I'm
just thinking about putting this into
practice yeah it's a good question and
it was a question that myself and my old
Chief people officer at idio would
debate a lot which is we took a lot of
creativity and kind of like create a
problem solving approach to how we did
the people function at Ideo that I've
kind of like learned to bring in here as
well and you can't you can't prototype
with people's
careers right so there is a line and
there is a level that you need to kind
of like say we're not going to go beyond
that but you can do a lot more protot
you can prototype in a way that goes a
lot uh further Beyond a product so let
me give a couple examples right um of
work we've done in the last in the last
year so one of our signature parts of
our employee value proposition at Airbnb
is live and work anywhere and live and
work anywhere was our reaction
to how do we deal with remote and hybrid
work or flexible work and it's a policy
that we launched two and a half three
years ago and we in the last 12 to 24
months have been consistently improving
it right almost treating it a little bit
like a software la so if that was live
and work anywhere 1.0 what's 1.1 what
would be 1.2 what would be 1.3 how do we
continuously improve it over time and
when I think about live and work
anywhere it's more than just our remote
work policy right it's it's a it's a
philosophy for how we will work and how
a modern flexible Workforce needs to
work in the future so let we talk about
a couple of the experiments we've been
running the first is we've been
deploying what I would call uh a a
gathering strategy approach so we're
actually saying rather than just say to
people come into the office once quarter
General guidance or three days a week or
whatever your version of that is we sit
down with every function and we
literally design a gathering strategy
with that function that says when do you
think when do we believe you should come
together for what purposes to do what
work at what frequency throughout the
year and how does that begin to tie to
an Enterprise wide Gathering strategy
that has these big 10 pole moments
called our launches I am a firm believer
that the no work should be done in the
same way and so a lot of the mandates
that we see happening right now feel a
little bit blun force because they don't
recognize that the work of a finance
organization is quite different to the
work of a product development
organization is different to the work of
an HR organization and so a lot of what
we've been working on is defining what's
the kind of work that that function does
and therefore what's our guidance and
our guidelines around how we think that
work should be done and then how does
that translate into a gathering strategy
so for our product development teams
they come together much more frequently
to do the kind of like gnarly problem
solving of like what's the next thing
we're going to launch or the the
technical reviews of a software of a
code base whereas actually if you think
about our finance or our GNA functions
they're coming together less frequently
for more Community Gathering recommit to
the mission and the purpose of actually
that function but we've been prototyping
with that all of last year and then the
last thing that I think we've just We've
Just Begun instituting six months ago is
for our most senior leaders the people
that are closest to the product launches
that really are the the people that will
help us be successful or not in our
product launches we recognize that most
of those people were spending about
three four days a month in the office
primarily in our headquarters in San
Francisco so we just invited them to
spend the same three to four days a
month in the office and we did inperson
weeks and inperson weeks was literally
an invite it's not a mandate it's an
invite from me to say we think you
should gather on this week we'll do some
light programming that will bring you
together and make it better for you to
be in the office together but that's
actually the time when you might want to
schedule that kind of like deep problem
solving work that's better done person
with your cross functional partners and
so like again how we're working for me
is a continuous Act of prototyping
because anybody that's choosing to be on
this hybrid or flexible path like we are
doesn't have the answer the answer is
going to emerge over time through
continual iteration and Improvement of
the model I I love that answer and
that's why I asked it right because
there's always things you can iterate
experiment and prototype on same
question we get with AI right noan some
of these questions like I can't really
do much with AI it's this there's always
something you can experiment with yeah
Ian I think it's pretty contrarian today
though like the the live and work policy
when you guys launched it was was
essentially call it like in the middle
of when everybody was going remote
because of
covid and
now the inverse has happened and you
know specifically if you talk to
investors I think every investor now is
genetically coded to say well if you're
not in the office we're not going to
write the check I'm hearing that all the
time for early stage tech companies and
yet it seems like you and really
coinbase are the only two companies that
are like nope this is the future of work
this is how we're going to continue to
do this I'm curious of like is there a
pull from the other side you know from
Brian or from others like we don't have
enough inperson time that's hurting our
ability to get things done I think
there's more of us than just coinbase
and Airbnb there's a small there's a
small Alliance of us that are kind of
like sharing learnings because it's a
it's a harder choice to make right uh to
to say you're going to commit to this
High Rd or flexible approach I think it
requires orchestration frankly it
requires me and my team to absorb the
complexity of that of that design
problem because right now if we don't
absorb it then we leave it to the
employee and then the employee decides
to turn up on a Monday and none of their
their their relevant co-workers are
there and it's a rubbish experience so
why would they bother coming into the
office right so I think I think what
I'll say is Brian deeply believes I
deeply believe we need to do the right
thing for Airbnb whatever makes Airbnb
stronger is the right thing to do we
have seen tremendous gains through
deploying and improving the live and
work anywhere approach we've continued
to see we obviously we do annual
engagement surveys we've continue to see
incredibly high levels of engagement
right 86% uh of employees would
recommend Airbnb as a great place to
work largely because of a lot of the
flexibility that we we afford them
through the Liv and work anywhere
program and all the policies and support
systems that go underneath that
attrition is at kind of historically low
levels and I acknowledge that we're in a
slightly funky labor market right now
but attrition you know a lot of actually
the reason why our attrition is trending
lower than you might expect we
contribute to the fact and we hear from
our employee base it's because we're
giving them the flexibility to choose
the best way to do their work that
really meets their needs as well as the
organizations's needs and what we're
finding with the the things that we're
doing in more intentional Gathering and
these inperson weeks we began to ask
questions in our engagement survey
around actually how effective are we at
problem solving and collaborating and
we're getting really good feedback and
sentiment from the organization that the
intentionality that we're building into
the the Gathering is actually helping us
spend the right amount of time right the
right amount of time doing the iners
work so it's not like five days a week
five days a week is just well it's just
a number right the reality is it's about
the right amount of time doing the right
work and when you can play with that
complexity and when you can absorb that
complexity on behalf of your employees I
think there's huge outsized benefits so
we have no intention to go back I only
intend for us to continue to to kind of
like move forward and continue to learn
and evolve how we're doing this to make
a fitter and healthier organization yep
that's it's very contrarian in today's
world and two things I'll leave you with
is number one nothing drove me crazier
than the open Office work plan to where
you could just get no work done when
you're in the office and then number two
the best talent has extreme agency and
so they can choose and those people are
consistently choosing companies that
enable some sort of flexible work policy
to where they don't have to be in the
office every day and it's not just to
hang out with their kids or do laundry
which I think is what you know what
Twitter says it's to get done at
home because it's a more effective
environment to get work done that you
can do by yourself without collaboration
I yeah two points you made I just want
to really like highlight one we see it
too like our ability to tap into the
best talent
right most diverse Talent into the into
the different Talent pools across the US
and globally our ability to do that
through this is just unparalleled right
compared to where we were before when
such a majority of the employee base had
to live within commuting distance of San
Francisco I mean it was it was a crazy
choice to be making if you think about
how we used to live in that world as
well we're certainly seeing that the
best talent has the agency that you're
describing and this is allowing us to
attract and retain that best talent over
time
the second is just so true which is when
you need to do deep work when you need
to write that memo or you need to really
consider that that report that you're
pulling together you I would much prefer
to do that at my kitchen table here
right where I'm talking to you today
than in an open plan office but when I
need to get influen when I need to
influence senior leaders in in the
decisions they're making it's much
easier to do that in one of our cafes
when I I literally interact with someone
for seven and a half minutes and I
accelerated a piece of work by 3 weeks
and so again it's consistently modula by
what's the type of work and what
environment does it need does it need
asynchronous collaboration or
synchronous collaboration is it better
done in person or they add it on
digitally yep well Ian thank you so much
for the time I think Airbnb is one of
the most interesting case studies in how
a company manages their their people and
their employees today and uh we'd love
to have you on in a few more months to
check in and see how things are going
well thank you for having me it's been a
pleasure to spend to spend time with you
both yeah thanks Ian HR Heretics is a
