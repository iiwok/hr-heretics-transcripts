it's like h I don't know. And then I'd
it's like h I don't know. And then I'd
 
it's like h I don't know. And then I'd
say the second piece is there's

Yep. And that feels like a very
Yep. And that feels like a very
 
Yep. And that feels like a very
antiquated view. Like what have you guys
antiquated view. Like what have you guys
 
antiquated view. Like what have you guys
learned about fractional and how is it
learned about fractional and how is it
 
learned about fractional and how is it
working? Thank you. It's a great point.
working? Thank you. It's a great point.
 
working? Thank you. It's a great point.
So relational is the what matters most.
So relational is the what matters most.
 
So relational is the what matters most.
like if we don't have a great
like if we don't have a great
 
like if we don't have a great
relationship with the client to be able
relationship with the client to be able
 
relationship with the client to be able
to figure out who is the best talent,
to figure out who is the best talent,
 
to figure out who is the best talent,
right? Because we are figuring out that
right? Because we are figuring out that
 
right? Because we are figuring out that
so we are the VC without having VC
so we are the VC without having VC
 
so we are the VC without having VC
money,
money,

right? So we're we're giving them the
right? So we're we're giving them the
 
right? So we're we're giving them the
trusted source and so when we give a
trusted source and so when we give a
 
trusted source and so when we give a
client a slate of talent, so if they say
client a slate of talent, so if they say
 
client a slate of talent, so if they say
we need an interim CPO, I say chief
we need an interim CPO, I say chief
 
we need an interim CPO, I say chief
people officer, I don't say Curo. Then
people officer, I don't say Curo. Then
 
people officer, I don't say Curo. Then
I'll say here's Kelly, here's John,
I'll say here's Kelly, here's John,
 
I'll say here's Kelly, here's John,
here's you know Jane, and here's the
here's you know Jane, and here's the
 
here's you know Jane, and here's the
strengths of each and this is how we
strengths of each and this is how we
 
strengths of each and this is how we
know them. And then they can figure out,
know them. And then they can figure out,
 
know them. And then they can figure out,
oh, okay, actually, I really like the
oh, okay, actually, I really like the
 
oh, okay, actually, I really like the
strength of this person, but this person
strength of this person, but this person
 
strength of this person, but this person
costs way more. Why is that? And we can
costs way more. Why is that? And we can
 
costs way more. Why is that? And we can
have a conversation. So that relational
have a conversation. So that relational
 
have a conversation. So that relational
thing, what the reason I think we've
thing, what the reason I think we've
 
thing, what the reason I think we've
stayed in business this long through
stayed in business this long through
 
stayed in business this long through
three
three
 
three
recessions is because we can give them
recessions is because we can give them
 
recessions is because we can give them
more than one choice. So we're kind of
more than one choice. So we're kind of
 
more than one choice. So we're kind of
like a mix between a marketplace where
like a mix between a marketplace where
 
like a mix between a marketplace where
you were given a lot of choice and just
you were given a lot of choice and just
 
you were given a lot of choice and just
like if the VC doesn't love that one
like if the VC doesn't love that one
 
like if the VC doesn't love that one
person, that's like not a great search
person, that's like not a great search
 
person, that's like not a great search
experience where it's like, do you like
experience where it's like, do you like
 
experience where it's like, do you like
them or not? too binary. So we're kind
them or not? too binary. So we're kind
 
them or not? too binary. So we're kind
of that middle place. So I think your
of that middle place. So I think your
 
of that middle place. So I think your
point is right around relational and why
point is right around relational and why
 
point is right around relational and why
we've survived, you know, three
we've survived, you know, three
 
we've survived, you know, three
downturns in terms of mindset of the
downturns in terms of mindset of the
 
downturns in terms of mindset of the
buyer. So companies want allin like
buyer. So companies want allin like
 
buyer. So companies want allin like
there's we're still in the all-in
there's we're still in the all-in
 
there's we're still in the all-in
mindset. Now that has of course been up
mindset. Now that has of course been up
 
mindset. Now that has of course been up
and down with the economy. So you know
and down with the economy. So you know
 
and down with the economy. So you know
when things were really hot
when things were really hot
 
when things were really hot
postco they would take anything anything
postco they would take anything anything
 
postco they would take anything anything
with a heartbeat right was like in so
with a heartbeat right was like in so
 
with a heartbeat right was like in so
then I think the market flooded with
then I think the market flooded with
 
then I think the market flooded with
fractional people they were like I can
fractional people they were like I can
 
fractional people they were like I can
name my price I can live my best life
name my price I can live my best life
 
name my price I can live my best life
tons of clients want me and it created
tons of clients want me and it created
 
tons of clients want me and it created
this expectation that that was going to
this expectation that that was going to
 
this expectation that that was going to
like stay there because they haven't
like stay there because they haven't
 
like stay there because they haven't
gone through the ups and downs of what
gone through the ups and downs of what
 
gone through the ups and downs of what
Kelly was saying which is like we've
Kelly was saying which is like we've
 
Kelly was saying which is like we've
seen it like a lot of different ways. So
seen it like a lot of different ways. So
 
seen it like a lot of different ways. So
the demand and the supply for sure have
the demand and the supply for sure have
 
the demand and the supply for sure have
been out of
been out of
 
been out of
equilibrium and and the supply is is
equilibrium and and the supply is is
 
equilibrium and and the supply is is
demanding like people are exhausted. You
demanding like people are exhausted. You
 
demanding like people are exhausted. You
know this you you two have probably had
know this you you two have probably had
 
know this you you two have probably had
your own you know sprints and recoveries
your own you know sprints and recoveries
 
your own you know sprints and recoveries
and so I think when executives get
and so I think when executives get
 
and so I think when executives get
exhausted they think fractional is the
exhausted they think fractional is the
 
exhausted they think fractional is the
answer but but clients are still like oh
answer but but clients are still like oh
 
answer but but clients are still like oh
I only want people who are not exhausted
I only want people who are not exhausted
 
I only want people who are not exhausted
so therefore I want the all-in. So, so
so therefore I want the all-in. So, so
 
so therefore I want the all-in. So, so
what I try and figure out is like of the
what I try and figure out is like of the
 
what I try and figure out is like of the
mindset of the client, is it maybe not
mindset of the client, is it maybe not
 
mindset of the client, is it maybe not
just one person? Like how do you just
just one person? Like how do you just
 
just one person? Like how do you just
kind of open the aperture and say, "Oh,
kind of open the aperture and say, "Oh,
 
kind of open the aperture and say, "Oh,
I need Kelly to do this strategy here,
I need Kelly to do this strategy here,
 
I need Kelly to do this strategy here,
but I actually need a comp person to do
but I actually need a comp person to do
 
but I actually need a comp person to do
this thing over here." And then do you
this thing over here." And then do you
 
this thing over here." And then do you
have like a recruiter, but we don't need
have like a recruiter, but we don't need
 
have like a recruiter, but we don't need
like a hundred jobs. We need like 20
like a hundred jobs. We need like 20
 
like a hundred jobs. We need like 20
targeted jobs. Maybe it's an interimm
targeted jobs. Maybe it's an interimm
 
targeted jobs. Maybe it's an interimm
recruiter. So, we try to think a little
recruiter. So, we try to think a little
 
recruiter. So, we try to think a little
more modularly. And that's the way to
more modularly. And that's the way to
 
more modularly. And that's the way to
get around the client saying, "We have
get around the client saying, "We have
 
get around the client saying, "We have
to have one person who can do everything
to have one person who can do everything
 
to have one person who can do everything
 
Yeah, there's something about like the
Yeah, there's something about like the
 
Yeah, there's something about like the
blind marketplace, Nolan, that's I think
blind marketplace, Nolan, that's I think
 
blind marketplace, Nolan, that's I think
hard for folks. Like what Sally said,
hard for folks. Like what Sally said,
 
hard for folks. Like what Sally said,
you're you're kind you're not really a

here's what you're getting. And that's
that's like blind dating. Like you blind
that's like blind dating. Like you blind

it's not just like multiple people are
it's not just like multiple people are
 
it's not just like multiple people are
doing it. And I and I think what I
doing it. And I and I think what I
 
doing it. And I and I think what I
learned is that the TAM is a lot smaller
learned is that the TAM is a lot smaller
 
learned is that the TAM is a lot smaller
than I expected because for me it just

it's a very small fraction. And my
it's a very small fraction. And my
 
it's a very small fraction. And my
question is like why? Like I still don't
