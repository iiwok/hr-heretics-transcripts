# The Fractional Executive Myth with Sally Thornton, Forshay

## Transcript

All right. Hey everybody, how are you
doing? Welcome to another session here
of HR Heretics. Really looking forward
to this session. I think we've
rescheduled it probably four times,
which means it's going to be incredible,
right? The longer you kind of wait for
something. Sally Thornton is joining us
today who's been a friend of mine for a
long time. I think more recently we got
closer and have been chatting. But
Sally's been in the game for gez what 26
 
years. 100 years since starting in 98
and has kind of done it all. tons of HR
leadership roles, advisory roles, board
work, and has owned her own firm for
almost 14 years. So, you started Forche,
Sally, in
 
parlayed out of kind of the public
company into venture. I heard of Sally
and I was like, she's so cool. What is
this? I was a baby. Didn't even know
what was going on. And you were
wonderful. I very much looked up to the
work you all did and you've been doing
it for almost 14 years, fractional work,
all sorts of exec search, org
development, team building, kind of all
of it. And we're stoked to have you
today to talk about the ups and downs. I
know you and Nolan wanted to talk about
like the joys of starting, you know, a
company and what that feels like through
turbulence, which I have not done. So
I'm excited to listen to this and just
talk about fractional work which I have
done and would love to chat on that and
a bunch of other stuff. So welcome.
Thank you. It's a joy. All right. So
Sally like the way I pitch forche is you
guys are doing interim placements and
executive placements. Is that right? It
is. Oh my gosh. Although I will say like
we kind of I create this little
speedometer because I feel like it's
hard to explain what we do and I'm like
we make great teams executive search. We
do interim and then we make teams great.
So that's kind of that team performance
side. So it's a little bit like I mean
it sounds holistic and like airy fairy
but it's actually like how you do great
teams is you have to think about the
whole team. Yeah. So intrinsically makes
sense like I built a business that was
doing this
too. What I found building continuum is
that every executive wants access to
fractional opportunities. Yes. And yet
there is I would say still significant
resistance from the demand side. So from
companies and what we found with the
demand side
is there's like a big trust barrier to
overcome if it's coming like if the
person's coming from a marketplace and
not from a trusted intermediary. Yes. So
like whenever my VC intros me and they
say oh like talk to Nolan people like oh
great like the VC introed me like I
trust them. I'll talk to Nolan even
though like maybe I don't like
fractional and stuff like that. Yep.
Versus when it comes from like a
marketplace or a not trusted source,
it's like h I don't know. And then I'd
say the second piece is there's
something around like you're either with
us full-time or you're not on our team.
Yep. And that feels like a very
antiquated view. Like what have you guys
learned about fractional and how is it
working? Thank you. It's a great point.
So relational is the what matters most.
like if we don't have a great
relationship with the client to be able
to figure out who is the best talent,
right? Because we are figuring out that
so we are the VC without having VC
money,
right? So we're we're giving them the
trusted source and so when we give a
client a slate of talent, so if they say
we need an interim CPO, I say chief
people officer, I don't say Curo. Then
I'll say here's Kelly, here's John,
here's you know Jane, and here's the
strengths of each and this is how we
know them. And then they can figure out,
oh, okay, actually, I really like the
strength of this person, but this person
costs way more. Why is that? And we can
have a conversation. So that relational
thing, what the reason I think we've
stayed in business this long through
three
recessions is because we can give them
more than one choice. So we're kind of
like a mix between a marketplace where
you were given a lot of choice and just
like if the VC doesn't love that one
person, that's like not a great search
experience where it's like, do you like
them or not? too binary. So we're kind
of that middle place. So I think your
point is right around relational and why
we've survived, you know, three
downturns in terms of mindset of the
buyer. So companies want allin like
there's we're still in the all-in
mindset. Now that has of course been up
and down with the economy. So you know
when things were really hot
postco they would take anything anything
with a heartbeat right was like in so
then I think the market flooded with
fractional people they were like I can
name my price I can live my best life
tons of clients want me and it created
this expectation that that was going to
like stay there because they haven't
gone through the ups and downs of what
Kelly was saying which is like we've
seen it like a lot of different ways. So
the demand and the supply for sure have
been out of
equilibrium and and the supply is is
demanding like people are exhausted. You
know this you you two have probably had
your own you know sprints and recoveries
and so I think when executives get
exhausted they think fractional is the
answer but but clients are still like oh
I only want people who are not exhausted
so therefore I want the all-in. So, so
what I try and figure out is like of the
mindset of the client, is it maybe not
just one person? Like how do you just
kind of open the aperture and say, "Oh,
I need Kelly to do this strategy here,
but I actually need a comp person to do
this thing over here." And then do you
have like a recruiter, but we don't need
like a hundred jobs. We need like 20
targeted jobs. Maybe it's an interimm
recruiter. So, we try to think a little
more modularly. And that's the way to
get around the client saying, "We have
to have one person who can do everything
 
Yeah, there's something about like the
blind marketplace, Nolan, that's I think
hard for folks. Like what Sally said,
you're you're kind you're not really a
market, you're an agent. Yeah, we're an
in Yeah. Like I know these players like
here's what you're getting. And that's
that's like blind dating. Like you blind
date versus a trusted friend who knows
this person. And I don't know how you
build that unless it's just time, sweat,
and tears. I mean, you've been building
that for 14 years plus. Wayward. Yeah.
But Kelly, my point though is is like on
the So like a lot of people are trying
to do this. Like I tried to do it. True
is building true bridge, right? Like
it's not just like multiple people are
doing it. And I and I think what I
learned is that the TAM is a lot smaller
than I expected because for me it just
makes sense to be able to like, okay,
Sally is world class at this thing. I
can't hire her full-time. I should tap
into her for this thing on a fractional
basis. But companies don't think in that
way. At least ventureback tech companies
don't think in that way. Some do, but
it's a very small fraction. And my
question is like why? Like I still don't
have a great answer after like building
a business in this for five years. Yeah.
Yeah. Look, I mean I I didn't try to
build the business, but I could just
talk to you for my side of it, which I
am a fractional right
now. I don't I think the TAM is actually
high. What happens like what I've seen
and heard and what I would do to be
honest with you both is like once that
company has relationships with people,
they don't need you anymore. Like they
might not go to the marketplace. They
they don't go to Sally or to continue.
They they they literally have their
rolodex and it becomes a micro
network. For example, if and when I
leave Quizlet I am fractional here again
not through a marketplace or you know it
was through a trusted person a
relationship they are going to ask me
first who can replace you. So I don't
know how we break that but that's kind
of what I'm seeing. So, I think the
demand is high for people who have lived
it successfully. And there's also a lot
of like, let's be honest, there's a lot
of people out there that are like, I'm
fractional, and they're just not they're
not great. And people get burned and
then fractional becomes branded, not the
person.
Yep. Yep. Yeah. And even here, I'll be
I'll tell you I'll tell you, they were
like I love this people team here at
Quizlet. They were like, we didn't
really trust it. We were like that's not
gonna [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work because we need
someone who's all in and we need and I
do think on the HR side it's a little
more bit more difficult because anything
you do touches every part of a company.
It's a little different than hiring a
bean counter like a finance person
fractional. They didn't trust it. And I
do think it takes you know I'm not
trying to be air but I do think it takes
a special combination of person to come
in and build trust get some wins and be
able to do this. Otherwise, it's kind of
makes it harder. That's right. That's
right. Go ahead, Sally. What's your view
on that? Yeah. When they get burned,
they brand the whole approach as wrong.
I totally
agree. Yeah. What were you going to say,
Nolan? Well, so, okay, Kelly, you said
it. So, I was going to say it, but I you
said it a lot nicer. Now, I'm going to
say it the way that I think I see it.
So, so VC market, VC hiring market falls
out basically in April of 22 is like
when we saw like a really big hit in our
business. And then everyone started
getting laid off. And everyone who got
laid off did this thing where they went
on their LinkedIn and said, "Now I'm
fractional." And what ended up happening
was fractional went from this like very
elite thing that only like you know call
it like the top five to 10 percent of
people had access to right to now
everyone's saying they do it and now
it's actually an adverse selection
problem. Like if you say you're
fractional on LinkedIn I now think you
suck. Yes, I get it. Wow. I get it. It's
like I'm gonna slap this on or I'm going
to be an executive coach. Everyone's an
executive coach. Oh my god. You can fall
over executive coach down below. Do you
want to know what I think the dirty
secret of fractional is? And I'm going
to be really honest here. Like honestly
you guys, there's really no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] such
thing as fractional. Like if you come in
and just say, "Well, I'm 20 hours a week
and I can't go to that meeting or no,
I'm not going to do that." You're kind
of out. Like the secret of fractional is
to try to build so much trust and
influence and understand this business
and what needs to be done so well that
you can do a full-time job in 25 hours.
And I think that's where a lot of
fractional people fail is because
they've kind of done it once or they got
laid off or fired null and they weren't
that good. They try to come in and do
this with boundaries that just backfire
in their face and then that hurts them,
makes the company not trust fractional.
I do believe it's doable. I don't
believe a lot of people have skill sets
on how to do it because that's the
secret of doing it well. I totally
agree. This skill set you mentioned. So
the difference when we do executive
search versus interim is in executive
search, right? We're looking for that
long-term relationship. All the things
that you're used to with executive
search. I don't have to, you know,
preach to you about executive search.
When it's interim, we interview
differently. We're like, how quickly can
you build trust? Like tell me examples
of how quickly you can get in, get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
done. How do you manage boundaries? How
do you manage expectations? And
boundaries isn't like I can't do dot dot
dot. Boundaries is is this a priority?
Let's are the priorities shifting? How
do we negotiate that? Well, what are
your skills around influence and
negotiation? Like that matters so much
more. And then also when you get the
trust, how do you bring in the next
person so that you're not trying to do
 
expectation in 25 hours. And by the way,
for us, fractional doesn't mean always
part-time. fractional of like 40 hours a
week feels part-time for a lot of people
who used to work 80. So like we do have
some full-time fractional people because
they find 40 hours to be a freaking walk
in the park from what they were used to.
So this is why I think you got you you
all are so good at forche because you
know and no this is no this is what I'm
talking about like I do think it's a
different craft. I think it is a whole
different beast of talent that I don't
think has been properly recognized as
such and interviewed for as such. Like I
think I think most of the world every
average Joe or Jane would consider
fractional to be synonymous with
part-time. Yeah. Which is not. The other
thing I will say is we've noticed that
the people who do well in it tend to be
people who not only have those skills of
negotiation influence you know building
trust but who have consulting
backgrounds like people from deote
accenture people who know how to scope a
project who can who know what they can
deliver on a certain time frame you know
how to bring others along not everyone
has that it's one of those things that
you know when you see it you recognize
that pattern but like if you've come up
through recruiting and you're just used
to working all the time. I don't usually
find that to be fantastic in terms of
managing boundaries. So, a lot of one of
the things we do is we try to coach. We
didn't have to coach you when we worked
with you, but sometimes we'll coach the
consultants if they've only been on the
inside. We'll coach them how to be a
good consultant because it's to your
point, it's a different
game. Hey everyone, we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors.

that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR. That is until my
friend Heather Doce, who leads talented
signal fire, told me to check out
Metaview. I got into the product and was
like, "Wow, AI actually does exist in
recruiting." And this product is sick.
Metave is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for
recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. MeteView covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metaview. Head over to
metaview.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metab's product experts. Tell them that
me and Kelly sent you. Or you could just
go to their website and get started for
free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in
minutes. What about the buyer, Sally?
who's primarily like the buyer that
you're working with. So certainly if
it's a smaller company, it's the CEO. If
it's a mid-size company, it can be the
head of HR, whatever we call them. We
also work with CFOs. We work with
CMOs. The larger companies we do with
work with the big big companies. We're
working with, you know, VPs. So like I
don't really care what the title is. I
just care do you have a budget? Do you
have a problem that we can quickly
solve? And are you not an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Look
at that. That's our That's our market.
That's our total address. This is what I
found. So with early stage companies,
they say like because they can't hire
well. So that's why they think about
fractional, right? They don't have
access to the talent pool. They'll never
be able to hire you because you're not
going to go work for a seed or a series
A company. And so it's like, oh great,
like I can tap into like they get the
the rationale, but then every time with
an early stage company, they're like,
okay, like Kelly's only working 10 hours
a week. I actually need 40. So I'm just
going to try and squeeze 40 into 10. and
like ruin Kelly's life. Then for the
later stage companies, there's kind of
like this issue with ego to where like
you know, you know, Johnny who's the VP
of Venge like really needs like a
director to come in and help him solve
this problem, but if he actually like
goes and asks for that budget, he looks
like an idiot because he can't hire that
person or like, you know, whatever it
may be. It's it's just not thought of
internally the same as FTE spend even
though it can be significantly cheaper.
So, how do you overcome like those sorts
of object objections and issues? It's
actually one of the reasons we've loved
working with finance the last year. We
don't have to explain how much money we
we are saving to a CFO and with the
chief people officer. We have to be like
remember that benefits load and remember
bonuses and stock like you're not paying
any of that. We have to remind them
because they take that hourly rate and
they times it by 2080 and they're like
oh my god this person's making so much
money. I'm like oh my god have you
forgotten how the balance sheet
works? So, no, finance people are better
clients to be honest. That makes total
sense. And so, okay, let's talk about
the hourly rate for a second. So, how do
people price themselves and what do you
find as effective strategies? So, I told
a few people we were talking about this
soon and and they're like, "No one ever
talks about money like what's going on?
What what do like it? It's the most
nebulous thing as far as like the rates
and whatnot." So, I'd love to hear from
you both. Yeah. Well, that's the first
thing Kell and I we caught up again. I
was like, "Let's talk numbers." So,
we're we're weird. We actually are
transparent. So we have a a transparent
pay structure between our clients and
our talent. It's 6535. So our talent
makes 65. We make 35. Some people
genuinely think that's reversed. I'm
like no no we only make 35. That's a
pretty big rake. That's a that's a
pretty large rake. So are you 1099 when
you did a mark marketplace or you W2?
 
paying all the insuranceances. So people
don't know how to do the self like
they're not putting their quarterly
taxes in. So what happens is when they
go for the 1099 because it's like only
 
margin? We were doing 15%. Yeah. Okay.
So that's great. So if you're only doing
 
expenses then the the consultant that
you know at the end of the year goes
holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I have this huge tax bill I
haven't thought about. And small
companies don't care about the
insuranceances, but if you're working
with medium-sized companies to larger
companies, they need you to have all
that stuff. So our actual like so gross
margin of 35 is not much, right? It's
like the app store because we're an
employer. So our net margin is not very
much. So what we do is we say to people,
it doesn't matter Nolan if you're a
better negotiator than John because
everyone gets the same. And that matters
for me because in the data, women don't
negotiate as well for themselves. they
negotiate better for others but not as
well for themselves. So if you have a
consistent pay structure then people
aren't worried are they negotiating well
with you and I want both the client and
the talent to feel respected and that
it's a win-win. So the only way to do
that is have transparency. So we say to
the client what's your budget and
obviously you know 80% of the time
they're like I have no idea tell me what
the market will will bear. So, we say to
the talent, what's your price? Like,
what do you need to earn on a W2 basis,
right? Because we're doing the taxes.
And then, you know, they usually start
higher. Like, they might be like 300,
 
going to get a 40-hour week work. Like,
we start to negotiate with them around
what are your true needs? Do you want
more work at a lower price or higher
paid work with fewer hours? Like, what
actually is right for you? And then with
the client, same thing. like we're we're
basically trying to make that market
where both sides say, "Oh, this is a
win." Right. But the rate can be as low
as we don't go below a hundred bucks
bill rate just because we're in that
more senior level work. But yeah, we
we're open about rates with everyone. I
think it's really important. So when you
say $100 bill rate, so that in it's like
 
Okay. So that's really interesting. So,
where do you think average clearing
price? Because like, you know, every
exec who's listening to this right now
is like, I want to do fractional work,
but I have no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idea what I should
charge. How should I think about it? How
how do you tell them to think about it?
So, if they haven't done the work at
all, I I mean, it depends on their
level. So, if they're director level,
I'll, you know, usually $100 net. So,
right, so they're making $100 an hour,
but again, we're paying our side of the
taxes. That's still a $200,000 job where
they have the flexibility, the benefits,
etc. Most directors will be okay in
that. Some people want
 
many hours. It's more advisory. So, it
goes back to like, are you advising or
are you rolling up your sleeves and
doing a lot of the work and that's where
a lot of the tradeoff happens and rates.
I just want to be clear because m I'm
used to like not getting benefits. Do
you know what I mean? Not being W2. So,
it's just a really important distinction
I want to put on there. Like you all are
offering those items which are
expensive. It's better tax treatment. In
California, you legally have to if
you're if you do the work that we do,
right?
And the companies that most of the
companies if you go to Forche's website
and you look at our clients, most of
those companies will not employ 1099. So
what will happen is if you go
individually to them and say, "Oh, I'm
going to be your maternity backfill for
this role. They're going to put you
through a shitty payroll provider who's
going to take a cut and provide you no
coaching, no negotiation advice. It's
going to suck." Interesting. Okay. So
the other thing we noticed is there's
like a honeymoon phase for these
engagements. And so you know like first
couple weeks like oh like especially if
you're smart executive and you get a
quick win right like you build trust
early like that shit's great. And then
typically what happens is the company
tries to like extract more out of the
executive. The executive tries to give
like a lot because they're still trying
to prove their worth and build trust.
and the company just basically, you
know, you give them an edge, they
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] take a mile. How do you guys
handle those things? So, this goes to us
screening to make sure that the
consultants are really consultants and
they can manage that. They will use us
as a sounding board. So, they might come
to us and say, "Hey, such and such is
asking for X, you know, what do you
advise?" And we'll be a sounding board
to them. But most of the time, Nolan, we
have people who are more like the
Kelly's who are I know how to handle
this. like like we don't have to I'm not
gonna say babysit, but like we don't
have to advise as many of our people
because they already have those chops.
We're looking for people who know how to
consult versus who are employees and are
just using to grind. If they're just
used to grinding and they don't have
those skills, they usually burn out and
and we we can't save them. Like there's
some middle ground of like we can coach
them a little bit, but if they require a
lot of coaching and they're going to
just be a re a recipient of grind, then
they're not great for this role. Kell,
what do you think? I like that phrase, a
recipient of grind. Like Kell, you and I
talked about this, right? You just said
it to open the show, which is just like
there is no such thing as fractional,
right? There's companies need you to be
allin. I mean, your Quizlet gig is
intense. And so I don't know like I I
struggle with this
because there there was a number of like
really high-powered dope exacts who were
very consultative on our platform and
still these companies are trying to like
you know squeeze them like the end of a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toothpaste bottle and not
remember like all the value that they're
delivering with what we had already
agreed to. Kell, what do you think about
that? Yeah, this is where this is where
I think it really has to come on. Matt
Exec, to Sally's point, this is where
like you both can do so much to help
these people. And I'll be honest, I
don't care if you're making 300, 400
bucks an hour. Like, you got to suck it
up a little bit. Like we all we talked
about this Nolan when you're wanting to
be a consultant and go on your own like
you got to give away some free stuff to
get out there and build trust and build
commitment like I probably gave away
some dollars that that first month and I
grinded and I was like oh gez what just
happened here but that goodwill is
really important because now we all
heard about like my mom like when I need
it I'm like I can't come to this meeting
I got to do this it's okay and so I
think whether you're an entry- level
employee, a big powerful executive, a
consultant, like no one can be too big
for their britches, like you got to
sometimes put down the ego and grind and
be a part of the team and earn that no
matter what you're doing. And that's how
you get branded. That's how you can be a
trusted fractional versus these people
that just don't really want to work.
They slap it on like you have to work.
Yeah. The only thing I would add to that
though, Kelly, is if we open up the
aperture. So, I think most of the time
what we've been talking about is if
there's an open role and they're asking
you to fill an open role, then they are
asking you to be essentially the
equivalent of an FTE, right? But that's
not all the roles. There's a lot of
roles where it's like we have we might
have an open role and we need something
for that, but it might be that like
they're in scaling mode. That tends to
be more where we get called and they
need like a person and a half. And so
they might have a person enroll and they
need that extra half, right? Or they
might have a person enroll and they need
another whole person because they're
scaling so quickly. So there's a lot of
ways to think about fractional that is
about growth, not just about are we
trying to not hire an FTE and therefore
squeeze them and treat them like an FTE,
right? That's that's like a different
model than just also like how are we
adding people quickly with the right
skill sets for a certain period of time
because no one can be perfectly staffed.
No company can be perfectly staffed. So
as they're going up and down this I mean
economically we should always be doing
what Peter Capelli called talent on
demand, right? It's like that's the
economic model that makes sense and
that's why CFOs and CEOs tend to be
better at like thinking about the more
modular way versus just like I'm not
sure who to hire from an FTE perspective
so I'm going to hire this fractional
person and treat them like an FTE.
That's when it gets tricky. I add I
think it also goes back to the
relationships we talked about before. So
when I came in here, it was kind of
like, you know, and they didn't have
budget for headcount. And I was like,
listen, we need these two roles and
here's how we're gonna make it a zero
sum game and, you know, net hires, but
this this won't work, you know, and you
don't just come in there and say that,
right? It was after a month of doing
things and whatnot. So, and we left it
open where it's like, hey, let's do this
for a few months because of the great
relationship. we can
re visit the hours, the contract, etc.
So, I just think Nolan to the like don't
allow yourself to get squeezed out of
the tube. Sometimes you got to, you
know, make a bigger make a bigger tube
and you can't walk in there and bang
your chest and do that. You actually
have to what I'm saying is give
something to do that, but you shouldn't
suffer forever because that's not fun.
No, I agree. And I think what you're
talking about, Kelly, is exactly the
right approach, which is you have to
like go build trust, get a couple wins,
and then have a come to Jesus
conversation, Sally. How do you
assess the executives on your platform?
And how do you how do you tell companies
to assess them? So, we're not a
platform. So, they basically come to us
and they have like a conversation like
they would with Deoid or McKenzie. My
joke is like, but we actually like get
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done. Although, I have friends
there, so you know, love them. So, it's
a conversation about like what problem
are we solving and how might we solve
it? So, it isn't so much like I need X,
give me X. Rarely does a client totally
know what they need. Like, usually they
come with like some set of problems and
we help scope it with them. And so, like
one of our values is co-creation. Like,
let's figure out what you actually need
and then we will send you three people
who match 80% of what you're looking for
and you decide what trade-offs you want.
Like price. Sorry. I mean executives on
the candidate side of the marketplace or
candidate side of the business. So how
do we assess the candidates? Yeah. Oh, I
mean it's behavioral
interviewing. It's like behavioral
interviewing with that extra layer of
can you consult if it's the fractional
side, right? Because remember we do
three things. So yeah. So then that we
look for influencing skills, ability to
be more like a project based thinker
versus just just a grinder. Like we're
looking for a metacognition person,
someone who thinks about how they think,
right? who can prioritize and push back,
who understands the business because if
they don't understand the business, they
can't push back with good data and is
really good at EQ because they have to
be able to understand that even if they
have the most data driven approach like
this is why we should be hybrid or this
is what emotionally they have to be able
to connect with the leader and have that
ability to build trust quickly and then
also read how to be effective. Okay. And
then how do you tell the company to
assess those candidates? I don't I mean
usually the companies are going to do it
the way they do it. The only thing I say
is from a fractionable besides I do have
one difference. I say don't look for
 
looking for 100%. And with interim I'm
like if they're at like 75% of what you
want go like it's progress over
perfection. Oh like not 100% of time but
 
they're like oh we need comp of blah
blah blah. they need to know of sales of
this and they needed to know biotech
specifically and blah blah blah. I'm
like they have 75% of what you want.
Just go like like wait. So so so
executives take that answer and they're
like yeah like cuz that feels very
counterintuitive to me. Tell me more.
Cuz like well I mean every exec you talk
to is like I'm not going to lower the
bar. Like what you're essentially saying
is lower the bar for fractional. So
different. So, if they didn't have
skills like the key skills of like
influencing, good communication, 100%.
That's just like I think that is
hygiene. You're talking about the night
to have stuff like the Yeah, exactly.
Like they're like if you have a job
description, they're like I want them to
have this kind of industry experience. I
want them to have these three things.
They must have stayed there for five
years each. Like all the things in
executive search that are ridiculous.
We're like all you need are key skills
of this get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done, you know, easy to
work with. go. Like it's much more of
about progress than it is like I need
that this person needs to be loyal to me
and stay for three years and you know
all that stuff. It's like no. Yeah. But
you did say like like technical skills
and so anyways our finding on this
was everybody wants to have everything
and you know I think like the scoping on
the client side like when you're working
with a potentially new client is
actually really hard and challenging.
People don't understand it unless you've
done it. And Kelly, you've done this
with like building your own personal
business. But I just find client
expectations even
with, you know, trying to like set them
appropriately. Often the problem is is
that the expectations far exceed
reality. Yeah. And like and that's the
same is actually true in executive
search, but makes it harder for
fractional because you're just like, I'm
only going to be here for 15 hours a
week. Like what are we talking about,
guys? Yes. Well, again, it's not always
part-time on our thing either. So it
isn't always the parttime. It's the like
we're more in the get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done. Like
one of our jokes we should have like
called ourselves get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done company
like fractional which means like
onboarding quickly whether it's 15 hours
a week or 40 hours a week or even we've
had some people bill hourly at 50 to 60
hours a week right the the key is like
can you just get moving versus like
interview for six months three to six
months for some job. Usually the reason
we are successful in that null and
there's plenty of times we're not and we
don't get the job is because they are
much more focused on get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done than
they are on perfection. So those are the
clients that kind of are more gel to us
is like can you help us like we need to
go and we're like great we're perfect
for you like we can get that done. I
like that framework. I like I think
that's actually a good framework for all
people who are thinking about doing
fractional which is just like when
you're assessing because you should be
assessing clients. You shouldn't just be
like, "Great, let's get into bed and
start working together." That can
actually really damage your reputation.
Like assessing for do they have problems
and are they thinking about like I used
to say is thinking about the problems in
the jobs to be done framework. Like what
is the problem? Let's just try and solve
the problem. Don't think about anything
else. Just think about problem solving,
I think, is a really good way to think
about it if you're an exec. Yes. You've
been doing this since 2011. I don't even
think I could spell fractional, let
alone new fractional people. I just it
just really wasn't at least I didn't
consider it as a thing. And now to our
conversation earlier kind of it should
be a new LinkedIn banner like fractional
like what has changed with you all? Like
how do you how have you handled this
influx of fractional people? How do you
tell good versus not? And maybe more of
an angle for advice for people who are
fractional trying to work with you. So
we used to call it interim because it
didn't back to your point of like is it
a fraction or is it a whole right
because the fraction could be 1.2x 2x of
their time. They mean different things
interim. Right. Right. So, we think more
interim. The way that we used to think
about it before was like it was to
Nolan's point kind of like someone's not
there. So, maternity backfill or someone
quickly resigned or had a health issue
and we would plug someone in. It was
much more like you know whole peg
go. The fractional is a good term in the
sense that it's more modular. That's
kind of what I prefer is like the
modular and the market has gotten
better. Like I had to get a freaking TED
talk about flexible work 10 years ago
because people didn't even know what I
was talking about. So now at least the
market knows what we're talking about.
Like I don't have to lecture them, which
I'm sure no one loved anyway. I felt
like this is the future of work. And I
mean I used to have people like
literally kind of like want to tap me on
the head. That's so cute. Flexible work.
And I'm like I think it's for
everything. It's really coming. So now I
don't have to adjust like what it is
which is great but I think the modular
consulting starts is going to remain
true and important in the future of work
meaning what problem are we solving
Nolan that's the question my team asks
every time we get on a call what problem
are we solving and how might we do it
without thinking about an open job a
human but actually open up and say what
problem are we solving what skills might
we need maybe it's 40 hours a week of
this person maybe it's 30 hours a week
of this skill set and just thinking more
like that modular and experiments.
That's kind of more of the direction
that we advise both candidates and
clients. Like we actually kind of see
them very similar because we're working
on this like triumphant like how do all
three of us solve a problem in a way
that we go like that was awesome. That
was some of the best work of our lives.
Like that's my northstar is people
saying that was some of the best work of
my life. Right? Like it's totally
possible but the framing matters. That's
why I think it is a little bit more
consulting.
Yeah. When somebody comes to you and
they're like, "Hey, I really want to do
fractional work." And you're like,
"Okay, great. You've never done it
before. You've only operated
inhouse. You seem like kind of
consultative, but like I don't know."
What do you tell those people? What's
your advice to them? I mean, until we
get to a real gig. So, I don't frankly I
don't love taking all those calls.
There's too many calls I could take. I
could be on calls like that all the
time. Yep. I basically say until I have
a real gig to talk to you about like
let's just put a pin in this like thank
you for telling us your interest. We got
it and we're thrilled. And then when I
have a client need that fits something
that matters to you. So what I ask them
is what are the things that matter to
you? Is it the CEO? Is it the culture?
Is it your commute? Is it the number of
hours? Like is it your pay? It can't be
all of it like real estate. Like you you
can't say like all 10 things. It's not
going to happen, right? So what are the
key things that matter to you? If we see
a project that meets several of these,
we'll give you a call and then we'll
diagnose quickly as to whether this
person is going to work in this scenario
because there's too many scenarios.
There's like some scenarios, right?
Every CEO has their crazy. So, like we
have to figure out like if that crazy
will work and I can't figure that out on
the first call. Yeah. Here's a real
question. I hear everyone bitching all
the time. I sent my stuff in. I had a
great chat with Nolan or Sally or Third
Bridge or whoever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. I didn't
hear from him again. I don't believe
them. and my stuff goes into a black
hole. Like, what the hell's happening
here? Does it really go into a black
hole or are they just not great? Like,
what happens? No, there's just more.
Back to Nolan's point, there's more
supply than demand. Exactly. Your your
eye is definitely on them. It's just
Well, I mean, they're in the database.
Is my eye on We have 10,000 people in
the database. No, mine.
Exactly, Sally. Like, people don't get
that. Like, Kelly, this is actually the
problem with this model. It's a huge
problem for us which is executives are
used to this white glove executive
search experience. Yeah. To where it's
like especially when you're available
and open like yeah you should be
expecting to be treated kind of like oh
let me open this door for you ma'am and
come right this way. But in the business
that Sally is in it's like you're a
number. And in fact, Sally, let's be
really honest. For people who don't have
experience, you're probably never going
to call them because your list is so
goddamn long of people who you've
already worked with, who have done great
work. And so, only if they're solving a
very specific niche problem, will you
pick up the phone and call them. Isn't
that the honest to god truth? Oh, yeah.
So, what I say to them is like, I don't
want to waste your time. I will honor
your time by when I see something that
fits, you will get a call. Now, anyone
to Nolan's point, anyone who's already
worked with us is always the first call.
If they're busy or not the right fit, we
go to the second rung. So, it's like
anything else, right? Like it's you go
with your trusted people first. And that
people who come in, we need them because
some of those other people have retired,
they've made their FU money, you know,
like it's a constant like we care about
getting new talent for sure, but we just
can't meet with them all until we have a
live project. This is brilliant because
I didn't ask the question to tee this up
because I am just not that smart today.
But this is perfect because it does tee
up the exact point I want to make which
we've talked about so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
times, Nolan, is you cannot rely on
other people or companies or platforms
to get you stuff and network for you and
get like like we've had lunch. I can
help you because of the leg work I did
myself to network and then that has
other great effects and this and that.
Side note, if you want to get time with
Sally, buy her lunch. maybe a martini
one, but that nothing replaces that. And
so when I have friends that call and
complain about this black
holeness, it's like you can sit around
and complain about this or you can
actually do some leg work and you know
what I mean? Oh my god, Kelly. Like
highlight that bullet double underscore
bold it like that. It's so
interesting continuum which is kind of
like the feed empty feedback. I would
describe it as empty feet because we
didn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which is like, oh,
like they never called back. And it's
like, well, like I haven't seen you get
a job recently, so is that my fault,
too? I mean, to be honest, it's a gift
to them. Like, why would I call you if I
have nothing to say? Like, until there's
a market need that they could address,
it's just, you know, like friendship,
which I have wonderful friends. But
yeah, I just think I just view these
things as working in tandem with great
people and companies like you both have
and had versus you all working for me.
It's a big mindset difference that I
think is really important. Well, and to
be honest, anyone who's kind of a
complainer like aren't our people
anyway? So, well, to be honest, there's
not a business there. You have to have
some resilience like this business.
Andrea on my team, she she's hilarious.
She always talks about like people have
got to like really be able to roll with
it. I can't remember what the term she
uses, but like they have to have some
spine. They have to have some
resilience. And if they're like, "What
have you done for me lately?" Like
swipe. Yeah. Speaking of resilience, and
my last question for you, Sally, is how
have you kept this up? Like this
treadmill of this work you've been doing
is almost 15 years and it's been through
all of it. And you said yourself you
were kind of in front of it at some
points getting tomatoes thrown at you at
TED talks. Like what's changed? Like how
have you evolved this over the years?
just how do you keep up the
relationships? Like what are some of the
secrets running experiments like you
know never being too tied into one
thing? So I've done really cool work
called work lab where we design thinking
that made works better. I'm now doing
some work with Leslie Pllo at HBS around
how do people have the most fulfilling
lives. Like for me it's about like
following my northstar which is
curiosity. incredibly smart people who
are also kind and generous and if I'm in
the learning space with the right people
like whatever emerges we will find the
bottom line and so far that's happened.
Awesome. I love that Sally. This was a
blast. Thanks so much for educating us
and also our audience. I think this is
like one of those honest conversations
that people haven't heard that they need
to hear. And so I hope if you're
listening to this, like your biggest
takeaway is is like nobody's managing
your career except for you. Sally's here
to help and can serve as a little bit of
like auxiliary, but like she's not your
agent and agents for executives don't
yet exist. It'll be really interesting
to see where all this fractional stuff
goes or ends or grows. I just don't
know. So, thank you so much, Sally. It
was a joy. Anytime we can laugh
together, I'm in.
Same. Same. Thanks, Sally. Bye,
everyone. Thank you. HR Heretics is a
