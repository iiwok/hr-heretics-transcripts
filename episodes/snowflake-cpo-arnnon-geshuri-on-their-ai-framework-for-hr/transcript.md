napkin uh design on a whiteboard and
napkin uh design on a whiteboard and
 
napkin uh design on a whiteboard and
then really within two days we can have
then really within two days we can have
 
then really within two days we can have
a prototype developed. So we can move
a prototype developed. So we can move

really really fast. The first example is
really really fast. The first example is
 
really really fast. The first example is
around our job descriptions. I estimated
around our job descriptions. I estimated
 
around our job descriptions. I estimated
it takes at least two hours. If you're
it takes at least two hours. If you're
 
it takes at least two hours. If you're
really focused and you want to get it
really focused and you want to get it

let's have our AI tool that's on every,
let's have our AI tool that's on every,
 
let's have our AI tool that's on every,
you know, every video call transcribe
you know, every video call transcribe
 
you know, every video call transcribe
and summarize the feedback so we can
