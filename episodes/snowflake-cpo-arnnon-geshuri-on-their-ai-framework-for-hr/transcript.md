# Snowflake CPO Arnnon Geshuri on Their AI Framework for HR

## Transcript

 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. So
Arnan, you are at Snowflake. I think
it's like one of these generational
companies. Uh like Slumman is like you
talked about everywhere. Obviously it's
not there anymore, but what is it like
being and being on the executive team at
one of these generational companies?
You know, we have an opportunity and I'm
so proud to be able to work with Shredar
and fulfill his vision about where we're
going as an organization. It really is
about how to redefine the space, not
only from an AI data space, but also
from a people space internally to really
think about we can be as creative as
possible, as creative as we want.
There's no limitations into how we
actually build out a people function
here. So, I'm really excited to get that
done.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And before that, um, which we'll
come back to Snowflake in a bit, but you
were the CHRO at Tesla for 10 years,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. About eight years. About eight
years. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Um,
&gt;&gt; but still still a good a good time.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah. I mean, that's a long time
to work with Elon. What was that like?
&gt;&gt; You know, it really made me realize how
important a few things were. The first
one was about uh open unfiltered
communication like really go to the
people you need to go to get answers
done uh you know problem solved uh just
really go to anybody you want in the
organization don't worry about hierarchy
right and the second was around that the
people team had to be as creative and
innovative as anyone else in the
company. So really pushed the boundaries
of how we thought about the people
function. And then the third one is
looking at kind of you know basically
being uh creative in the way that we're
focused and looking at at data analytics
as a way to really create good insights
into the company. So working with and
I've done this multiple times working
with multiple engineering exe executives
that data and analytics and people
analytics really help create insights
that you can help lead the function and
lead the business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it must be I mean he's obviously
brilliant. It must be incredible to work
with, you know, someone that that smart.
And I think if I was in the audience
right now, you know, Nolan, I'd probably
be wondering that is so cool. And you
mentioned kind of creative thinking and
the people team and innovative. What are
some of the things that he pushed you to
do at Tesla or you guys did that would
fall under that?
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, just like I'm doing here
at Snowflake, it's kind of the same
theme, right? The idea is you build a
good foundational capability in
analytics. As I mentioned before, you
think about people analytics and data
analytics and you measure everything.
you to think about how do you can drive
insights through all the touch points
that people have within the company so
that way you can make really good
decisions on the future of the
organization. The second is how to align
the people function to the northstar of
the company and to make sure that you
follow the vision. Like you don't you
don't do things that are kind of on the
side that don't make quite make sense,
but you want your user experience. You
want the employee experience to be very
consistent. And in all my work with
these amazing CEOs, it's about creating
an organization that helps the company
fulfill its mission and really be
focused on that northstar.
&gt;&gt; So Arnot again, you're at Snowflake now.
So what's the how did you end up there?
Like what's that story? [snorts]
&gt;&gt; Well, I've been here about a year and a
was looking for someone to come in and
really reinvent the way that the people
operate. And there's so much amazing
things here in terms of AI capability
and analytics and data which I said that
that was like core to what I've learned
how to leverage and to really rethink
the way that you can optimize and
self-actualize the function. So I've
been working really hard to really look
across the organization. How can we
build something truly iconic here and
help the company enable itself? Help the
company find the right talent. Help the
company build a learning organization.
how the company can build a great
culture. All these components to help
drive towards being, you know, our
northstar in our mission of supplying
organizations with data and AI and
making them very enabled.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we're like we're we're
basically in November, which is
unbelievable, of 2025. I'm assuming you,
like everybody else, is either done with
or in the middle of [snorts] 2026
planning. How are you thinking about
like your mandate for 26 and what is
your team going to focus on?
We're very focused on how can we
leverage all of the capabilities in the
AI infrastructure that we have here and
we set kind of we set up a three-prong
approach to how we're going to deliver a
lot of our products to the organization.
The first prong is about anything
repetitive we will automate with AI. So
anything repetitive we automate.
Anything that's creative will augment
and with AI, but you still have the
human component making the final
decision. And then anything that's
judgment or emotional or intelligence,
it's solely done with people. So we kind
of created these three categories and
then we said to you know basically to
our own team we're going to create a set
of products a set of capabilities a set
of processes that will align all of our
initiatives to one of those three
important prongs to our model and
develop AI capability to support each of
them.
&gt;&gt; That's a really interesting framework
that uh I have not heard nor considered.
So repetitive, creative, and then
judgment,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; So let's go into each one. So for
repetitive,
&gt;&gt; the story I tell myself when I hear that
is is um there's a lot of stuff that I
do every day that uh is actually better
done or augmented with AI and it could
speed me up in a significant way. These
are like the the workflows of a company
like how people get work done, that sort
of a thing. How do you guys think about
prioritizing and then actually going and
building solutions?
&gt;&gt; The one great thing is that we can move
fast here. So we can put something on a
napkin uh design on a whiteboard and
then really within two days we can have
a prototype developed. So we can move
really really fast. The first example is
around our job descriptions. I estimated
it takes at least two hours. If you're
really focused and you want to get it
out the door, we can get done in five to
 
job descriptions, you know, you're
talking about a year savings of a person
hour right off the bat. The second I
want to mention is during the interview
process. So, one of the ways I said,
let's have our AI tool that's on every,
you know, every video call transcribe
and summarize the feedback so we can
immediately load it into our applicant
tracking system. And it we realize it
saves over 7,000 hours of person time,
right? Just by doing that, you know,
write in your notes and also like the
recruiters and the hiring managers can
have this thoughtful conversation.
They actually can look at the person and
connect look at the person and say, you
know, I'm glad that I'm interviewing you
today. I'm, you know, making that
connection.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 100%. And then you know on that
too I'm assuming your team then you know
for example on the the interview notes
stuff um like for me I do exec search
and I'm spending a lot of time in metav
view on the back end like really coming
up with templates because the templates
is like you know if you think about it
is like the tool is amazing at capturing
everything that happened but then to
like really get you like it'll get you
to like 70%. But if you have a really
good template like off the shelf that
gets you to like 90% and then it's like
 
recommendation done and ship it. I'm
assuming like your team is like spending
a lot of time on the back end making
sure that that stuff is production ready
for the rest of the employees. Yeah. you
know, we make sure that when we roll
something out, it's well thought
through.
&gt;&gt; And so we have whether it's pre-made
interview questions to help the manager
think through what they're supposed to
be doing and having different interview
questions per interviewer so we can
cover a more 360 on the candidate,
whether we have templates of what to
follow. Yeah, we have that all laid out
so that like you said that's a big a big
portion of the step there and then the
notes then can be are organized based on
that template and come back into the
system and you just have this really
amazing portfolio of information on the
candidate and can make a really good
decision. Right? Then you can read it,
read through it, have discussions, have
a hiring committee and then talk through
the candidate.
&gt;&gt; So going back to your framework you know
you said judgment and sorry creative and
judgment were the other prongs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What are examples of like how
you're thinking about uh like that
creative prong like and how are you guys
providing leverage there?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I'll give a great example
again. We're rolling stuff out that's
that is meaningful and not scary and
super helpful at the onset. So, a couple
good examples is we did this all
employee survey and we had 9,000
comments that came in. like people wrote
a a tremendous amount of information. So
we used our AI tools to consolidate all
that information, find the themes,
&gt;&gt; y
&gt;&gt; build the summaries. It would have taken
us two weeks to do a content analysis,
but it did it in seconds and then we
able to look at all the data and then
make judgment calls after that or make a
call about what we want to focus on as a
company for the next year, you know,
based on the survey results. So that's a
where that it took all that great data
and then we applied a little bit of the
creative like here's how we're going to
use this data and move forward with it.
A second one that we use on the creative
side is we piloted in two organizations
and rolling out across the company a
mentorship program. It's a peer-to-peer
mentorship program. And the way it works
is that mentors put in their data into
our Cortex AI. They type in their
profile and what they are good at. And
then the mentees, the people who would
love to get, you know, coaching
internally, put in their information and
we have this curated list of questions
and then the AI tool then matches them
on the back end through all these
variables. We're refining that matching
process to optimize that that
relationship so they can have a really
good session, multiple sessions to do
coaching. So we curated the the
structure, the format, we relied on the
tools to actually put it all together.
So, those are two great examples of how
we use the tools. We still on the
creative side still own the program, but
it it helps us like accelerate the work
that we're doing. People love it. I
mean, it's so well done and we just love
this peerto-peer and more people are
joining it. Just a really great way to
leverage the AI tools, right? And then
if I can just jump on the more the
judgment side,
&gt;&gt; please. You know,
&gt;&gt; my next question.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. We we basically say, look,
when it comes to performance reviews or
promotions or talking to your employee
around their career goals, we want that
to stay human because all that is really
about the connection. All that is about
that relationship with the manager and
themselves. And so giving a performance
review, talking to them about promotion,
talking to them about growth, we don't
want this to feel automated. We don't
want this to feel disconnected like
someone like a bot is telling them how
to do their career. It's a person who
knows and can give great advice. We want
to keep that more purist. So that's how
we think about it. And those are the
models and those are some examples that
we use on each one.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. MetaView is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metaview's suite of AI agents works for
you at every stage of the hiring
process. Their platform powers instant
job postc creation, AI powered candidate
Q&amp;A, insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metav changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metivview covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
MeteView. Just head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts or get started for free. You'll
be uprun and AI enabled in minutes.
&gt;&gt; Those are great examples. So basically
what you're saying on the the judgment
piece just to make sure that I heard you
&gt;&gt; is that in the delivery right of
feedback or in the delivery of a
performance review or in the delivery of
a you know comp change that's always
going to be human. Totally agree.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; What about the inputs? Um cuz I feel
like some of the inputs I don't think it
should be I I don't think it's ever
going to be all machine but I do feel
like the machine can start to call out
some of the blind spots uh that managers
and leaders might have. Are you guys
thinking about that? You know, the way I
think about it is I don't want I want
the managers to really engage and do the
work around how their teams and
individuals on their team should grow
and develop and get feedback. So, I
don't want to give them a pass on that.
I want to make sure that they're the
ones who are making the calls. They're
thinking it through. And the whole idea
if you look at this in all those three
kind of categories in more of a holistic
if we can take time off of people's
plates by doing like the job
descriptions doing all these other
things if we can take time of analyzing
all these questions it gives them the
time then to focus and invest in that
relationship with that person that
onetoone saying I'm the one who made
this call I did not relinquish it to any
bot any you know anything that had to it
was it's me to you talking about how we
can be better together and I just want
to preserve that. I don't want to lose
that that magic because then you know
building connections in a company as we
all know because we're all professionals
in this field is so important when a
person feels a sense of belonging they
feel connection to their manager they
feel connections to the company and to
the mission and to the vision they're
there I mean they're engaged and if we
break that bond it's going to really
injure and jeopardize you know I think
that relationship so I'm just trying to
get everything else off the plate enough
so they can spend time investing in the
person.
&gt;&gt; And you said, you know, preserving that
Arnon, it's actually to to your earlier
points, which were great. It's making
more time for that.
&gt;&gt; You know, I keep hearing, well, my job's
going to go away if this or this or
that. It's like actually there's so much
more to do over and beyond the fairway
of the lift that we all dog paddle and
survive every day. So, it's creating
more space for things that we always
have on the delight list, you know, the
nice to have that would be great to-do
list becomes the job.
&gt;&gt; But I I'm in total I'm in agreement. I
mean, that's that's the magic of this
where all the stuff we wish we could do
as a leader, all the stuff we do as a
manager, as an employee, you know, as a
colleague in the company, now you're
able to all this other list that's on
the side of things that if I just had
time, I could really optimize this role.
I could make it better. I could
innovate. Now it's time. So that's
exactly the message I'm trying to get
across the organization. We're giving
you time to build and be and do
meaningful work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like just, you know, right? So just I I
love the way you're thinking about it
because I'm totally aligned with that.
&gt;&gt; I just talked to someone an hour ago and
this is just a you know tactical
example, but I was like that's what this
is. It's a bunch of tactical examples
all wrapped together and he had like
 
a sheet, a letter. He's like, "Ah, I did
it in like less than an hour watching
football using Gemini. All the letters
are done." and actually spent my time
like thinking about what the decision
was, the context, the person, the comp
range, the philosophy, and I was able to
put together talking points around the
why behind this change versus use all my
time to document the damn change. And it
was like, that's a re-recruitment
conversation now, not a I spent two days
doing all these silly letters just to
just communicate something.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I'm in alignment with that,
Kelly. But isn't it isn't it like a like
a yes and uh AI can help us like cover
blind spots here. So again I don't think
it's like machine making decision but I
think it's like a I don't know like I
like to have you know like think about
HR traditionally has been this way which
is the business will go through like if
we're talking about comp the business
will go through they will allocate comp
for their team if we give them
discretion and then the HRBP will be
like I don't know about this one like
don't we see AI filling in more of that
role like I I think that that's coming
for sure. Do you think that's coming,
Kelly?
&gt;&gt; But how that's that's totally different
though than what I was talking about,
right? I mean, of course that's coming.
I think
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. And
&gt;&gt; yes.
&gt;&gt; Yes. And yes, I would agree.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.
&gt;&gt; I mean, at some point the question the
question is,
&gt;&gt; will AI be able to do all these things,
right? That that is the question. At
some point, it's like when do I show up
as a bot? and you can actually have this
very in-depth re-recruitment,
highly contextualized and individualized
conversation. That's the that's kind of
where my mind goes. But I think we're
&gt;&gt; so Arnold, I'll give you um I'll give
you an example that I've been thinking
about recently. So, uh do you guys do
calibrations?
&gt;&gt; But we have calibration sessions. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what I've been thinking about
recently is um in the era of everything
is being recorded, I can very much
imagine there's you know some AI
recorder probably the same one you're
using in recruiting that's listening to
the calibration session that then uh you
know after the fact after the humans go
and make the decision you know call it
stack ranking for this purpose but
obviously only Microsoft does that but
whatever we do we give out we give out
ratings
then uh you know we kind of align on
that thing and before the final check
from a human, we go to the AI, we say,
"Hey, here's what we came up with. Is
this congruent with what you heard in
the meeting?" Those like, what do you
think about that idea? Because that
feels to me like a great application to
help improve decisions and judgment
specifically.
 
&gt;&gt; So, so I I still think it goes back to
what we've been talking about in terms
of what do you want? What's your
philosophy around how you leverage all
these tools? Right? I think you have to
make a conscious effort not to have
things creep in too much so that you're
relinquishing responsibility. So I think
that yes, the tools could provide some
type of analysis. But I think you have
to have a philosophy around, you know,
we're not going to use that though.
We're not going to leverage that. We're
not going to even attempt to do it
because this has to be a human process.
So I really think that the company has
to make a conscious decision about how
it approaches these types of
applications to not see this creep
because I really want to preserve and
I'm using that that very you know
intently intentionally is that um I want
to preserve a group of activities that
is very human and very connected and I'm
going to push back on creep.
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's a good that's a very interesting
and I would even say contrarian take
because everyone else is just like
trying to bring it into everything. And
I think another thing of what you're
saying is is like we are like I use chat
all day long now. I think everybody is
and I'm outsourcing a lot of my thinking
to chat GBT and I what I'm hearing you
say is like nope time out. Like we've
saved your brain from all this
Now you need to go spend that brain
power on the most important thing which
is the human activities.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; That's a re That's I actually really
like that take, Kelly. I hadn't thought
about it that way.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, I if if we're if we're
good with this, I'd love to pivot a
little bit. Um or not, I just I can't
get over some of these companies you've
been a part of. And I mean, early
Google, Tesla, now Snowflake. I mean,
you've got you've got some opinionated
people in the leadership seat across the
board there. And you're so you're so
calm and, you know, very calming
presence. Like, how did you work with
those folks for five years here, you
know, eight years with Tesla? like h how
did you influence them? How did you
survive is probably not the right word,
but you know what I mean? Like how did
that marathon look for you?
&gt;&gt; Well,
it kind of goes back a little bit to
what I mentioned earlier and maybe I'll
kind of rephrase it a little bit is that
it was super important that I created a
highly functional, highly talented
people team. I relied on data in terms
of a backbone so I could use data as a
common language across the company. Um
and I am I am just thrilled that I work
for a company that I can do data and AI
together. It's like a candy store for
me, right? Because I love doing this.
But when you work for you know data
usually provides a really good
foundation. So when I went and try to
influence and drive decisions and I do
this today I'll have the data in front
of me. I said this is what the data this
is the data this is what I think it's
saying to us so you can have a really
thoughtful conversation around the
interpretation of the data the insights
and then you can make a really great
decision for the company so for me from
Google to Tesla to Snowflake it really
is about creating a backbone of
analytics of a high functioning
organization so that when I go into
these conversations I go with authority
and I go with really good information so
we can
insightful business decisions and I'm
adding value to the organization, the
team's adding value. So, as long as I've
maintained that and pushed it and I've
been self-reflective and built really
incredible teams, it usually creates an
environment where I can influence and
really create a great relationship with
all the senior leaders in the company.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a love that the backbone,
the back stop. It gives you like a an
armor of um you know confidence. I guess
I always try to think of the audience.
What do your teams look like when you go
into organizations? Um, what do you look
for first? How do you assess? Who do you
hire first? What are your like to
survive? I'm going to like bring in
right this oxygen tank to be able to
create that. How does how does it look,
Arnon?
Well, I assess each organization I'm in
and I make sure that we're doing what we
deliver, what we say we're going to
deliver and we set up really good
audacious goals for the organization
and I need this portfolio of people
within the organization. So, I do need
folks who have traditional HR work and
additional people work. I do tap into
areas that folks have been consultants
in the past and they think a little bit
differently. And then I bring people who
are sometimes outside of the people
environment. Maybe they could be a data
scientist or a statistician or someone
who can help or economist, someone who
can help really elevate the data side of
the business. So you put all that
together, you put kind of this great HR
team that has deep subject matter
expertise. You'd have consultants kind
of the mindset maybe they work for
consultant firm early in their career to
create kind of the strategy and thinking
about far-reaching ideas and then you
have outside of the industry bring them
in to basically amplify different ideas
and innovation. You bring them all
together and you have this winning
combination. So I think about that as a
framework and then I toggle depending on
what exists and what the business needs
from both a tactical and strategic
perspective. But you kind of you make
sure that your team has a wide breath of
capability so that you can deliver a
range of products and services and
initiatives to the organization.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. On the data side you mentioned
right that's kind of your you know um
cryp kryptonite taken in uh to these
roles. What what is one or two titles
on that that correlate to that ability
to have that kryptonite that you you
want on your team? I have been thinking
about in this innovative way, you know,
I have been thinking about a director of
AI employee experience. I have been
thinking about something of that effect
where we can leverage the tools and
create really customize capability for
the organization so it meets people
where they're at. So how can we
incorporate that and actually orient the
job to something different to something
that that meets the innovative way that
we're thinking about right? So there is
a way that all these you know all these
job roles are going to have an element
of data analytics in it have an element
which I did in the past element of AI in
it and some of the titles are going to
start to evolve I mean that's just how
it's going to work and then you know
important piece of this is around
mindset right I really look for people
who are curious who want to try things
and experiment and say like I've done
this for 20 years in this way but I'm
willing to try something different. I'm
willing to take all this knowledge and
apply it to something more innovative or
evolve it. So I really appreciate HR
folks, people folks who have this innate
sense of curiosity, this mindset of
experimentation that they say, yeah, we
can just try something different. Let's
just try let's just apply this and see
what happens. And that makes for a great
team as well. One of the things you
mentioned earlier that I wrote down is
that you guys are like you guys are
really moving fast and rolling out
experiments in like you know the the
span of a couple days. I think the one
of the secrets to success right now are
these really short feedback loops and
just like spinning together just you
know very quick trials like getting
things in people's hands uh getting them
to tinker with it and getting it back.
You're seeing this a lot right now in
product. Um, the analog in product right
now is no longer are we like if if you
want to talk about a feature like no
longer are we having a discussion about
it like go into lovable or go into
replet spin the thing up let people like
you know toy around with it because
there's something around like the actual
I feel it and I can see where it's going
even though it's imperfect as opposed to
words. Are you guys doing that? Like how
does that work internally? The whole
company believes in piloting projects
like you you build something it's not
perfect right you know perfect is the
enemy of good sometimes and you want to
kind of get things out there to get good
feedback so we do a lot of pilots like
we will develop something really fast
but we'll maybe test it with a group of
you know a group that's willing to play
with the tool but it's fast iteration
and their responsibility is to play with
it do use cases give us quick feedback
like you said really good product teams
do the exact same thing Right. And so
we're no different because we're
