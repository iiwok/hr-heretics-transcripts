&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, Kelly, you know, you and
 
&gt;&gt; All right. So, Kelly, you know, you and
I were at a dinner on Thursday. I had to
 
I were at a dinner on Thursday. I had to
be very careful about what I say because
 
be very careful about what I say because
we have a rule at these dinners, which
 
we have a rule at these dinners, which
is we don't talk about them.
 
is we don't talk about them.
&gt;&gt; But it was the fight, it was the fight
 
&gt;&gt; But it was the fight, it was the fight
club rule for
 
club rule for
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I describe it as fight club.
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I describe it as fight club.
But what I can say is that of the people
 
But what I can say is that of the people
who attended, we had a very large
 
who attended, we had a very large
discussion on AI and
 
discussion on AI and
it shocks me that so many people still
 
it shocks me that so many people still
are basically doing nothing. And so
 
are basically doing nothing. And so
Mark, LinkedIn should be one of the
 
Mark, LinkedIn should be one of the
players in this space. I think everyone
 
players in this space. I think everyone
has been looking to LinkedIn being like,
 
has been looking to LinkedIn being like,
"All right, like I use you every day,
 
"All right, like I use you every day,
multiple times a day." I think for me
 
multiple times a day." I think for me
specifically, like outside of Instagram,
 
specifically, like outside of Instagram,
LinkedIn probably gets the majority of
 
LinkedIn probably gets the majority of
like my social usage. Uh, obviously this
 
like my social usage. Uh, obviously this
is where we go to look for jobs, where
 
is where we go to look for jobs, where
we on the recruiting side go and look
 
we on the recruiting side go and look
for candidates. So sounds like you guys
 
for candidates. So sounds like you guys
are launching a product in the space.
 
are launching a product in the space.
Can you tell us a little bit about it
 
Can you tell us a little bit about it
and what's going on over there?
 
and what's going on over there?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. Uh, well, first off,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. Uh, well, first off,
that has been a lot of my experience as
 
that has been a lot of my experience as
well. So, you know, I co-lead our talent
 
well. So, you know, I co-lead our talent
business and spend a fair amount of my
 
business and spend a fair amount of my
time meeting with customers one-on-one,
 
time meeting with customers one-on-one,
hosting dinners, roundts. There's a real
 
hosting dinners, roundts. There's a real
spectrum of where customers are with
 
spectrum of where customers are with
regards to, you know, AI adoption. And
 
regards to, you know, AI adoption. And
AI adoption means different things. it's
 
AI adoption means different things. it's
general fluency with themselves or
 
general fluency with themselves or
across their function or across the
 
across their function or across the
company or how are you using AI to
 
company or how are you using AI to
improve internal processes and it's
 
improve internal processes and it's
definitely not one sizefits-all.
 
definitely not one sizefits-all.
So I've had a very very similar
 
So I've had a very very similar
experience. We're really excited about
 
experience. We're really excited about
hiring assistant. So hiring assistant is
 
hiring assistant. So hiring assistant is
LinkedIn's first agentic product and so
 
LinkedIn's first agentic product and so
I'm sure you've heard about agents. So
 
I'm sure you've heard about agents. So
the easiest way I kind of think about
 
the easiest way I kind of think about
agents is AI's been around for a long
 
agents is AI's been around for a long
time and there's been different kind of
 
time and there's been different kind of
stages of AI that's happened over the
 
stages of AI that's happened over the
years. There was you know machine
 
years. There was you know machine
learning which was created matching deep
 
learning which was created matching deep
learning which improved upon that and
 
learning which improved upon that and
then a few years ago the world became
 
then a few years ago the world became
very familiar with chat GBT and then a
 
very familiar with chat GBT and then a
number of other similar platforms
 
number of other similar platforms
generative AI it's all about creating
 
generative AI it's all about creating
text and images even code and so we've
 
text and images even code and so we've
been along on this journey for a while
 
been along on this journey for a while
at LinkedIn and so if you think about
 
at LinkedIn and so if you think about
the core of LinkedIn we want to be able
 
the core of LinkedIn we want to be able
to ensure members can find the
 
to ensure members can find the
connections the jobs information in the
 
connections the jobs information in the
feed that is most relevant to them. So
 
feed that is most relevant to them. So
matching has always been a very big deal
 
matching has always been a very big deal
and it's helped improve product quality.
 
and it's helped improve product quality.
So we've been building AI into all of
 
So we've been building AI into all of
our products from Flagship to LinkedIn
 
our products from Flagship to LinkedIn
recruiter for like well over a decade.
 
recruiter for like well over a decade.
And so because ultimately what we're
 
And so because ultimately what we're
trying to do for our customers and
 
trying to do for our customers and
recruiting is we want their users to be
 
recruiting is we want their users to be
able to find the right candidate as
 
able to find the right candidate as
efficiently as possible. Uh a big big
 
efficiently as possible. Uh a big big
moment happened for us in November of
 
moment happened for us in November of
 
been great being part of that
 
been great being part of that
organization for a number of reasons,
 
organization for a number of reasons,
but we were able to take an early look
 
but we were able to take an early look
at chatbt before the world had kind of
 
at chatbt before the world had kind of
seen that latest model. And we
 
seen that latest model. And we
immediately left that meeting and said
 
immediately left that meeting and said
we need to rethink the way in which we
 
we need to rethink the way in which we
could create value for our users and
 
could create value for our users and
members with this new technology.
 
members with this new technology.
And so short order after that meeting we
 
And so short order after that meeting we
started to really revamp the way your
 
started to really revamp the way your
recruiter worked building in a lot of
 
recruiter worked building in a lot of
these like generative AI features. So
 
these like generative AI features. So
think about AI assisted messaging or AI
 
think about AI assisted messaging or AI
assisted search you can have a more
 
assisted search you can have a more
conversation with recruiter to be able
 
conversation with recruiter to be able
to find the right set of candidates and
 
to find the right set of candidates and
the results have been kind of undeniable
 
the results have been kind of undeniable
with even using those features. So like
 
with even using those features. So like
 
example. But shortly after we started
 
example. But shortly after we started
building those features, we were looking
 
building those features, we were looking
at what's next. So moving from
 
at what's next. So moving from
generative to kind of agentic and so
 
generative to kind of agentic and so
fortunately we have some of the best
 
fortunately we have some of the best
kind of engineers, AI engineers in the
 
kind of engineers, AI engineers in the
world. We have incredible access to
 
world. We have incredible access to
technology. And so we thought about
 
technology. And so we thought about
building this for a while. We actually
 
building this for a while. We actually
started building it probably about 15ish
 
started building it probably about 15ish
months ago and we announced it and then
 
months ago and we announced it and then
went into charter last October. And then
 
went into charter last October. And then
we've been meeting with our customers,
 
we've been meeting with our customers,
we've been learning with them to ensure
 
we've been learning with them to ensure
that we're building this product in a
 
that we're building this product in a
way that will work for our customers. So
 
way that will work for our customers. So
the way to think about what hiring
 
the way to think about what hiring
assistant is, if you think about each of
 
assistant is, if you think about each of
the steps in recruiting from intake all
 
the steps in recruiting from intake all
the way to the person is hired and you
 
the way to the person is hired and you
break that down into different steps.
 
break that down into different steps.
We've been very focused with hiring
 
We've been very focused with hiring
assistant for now and what will be
 
assistant for now and what will be
available at launch will be the intake
 
available at launch will be the intake
process, the actual searching for
 
process, the actual searching for
candidates and then the messaging
 
candidates and then the messaging
process. So we've been looking laser
 
process. So we've been looking laser
focused on those three steps and we can
 
focused on those three steps and we can
talk road map in a bit if that's
 
talk road map in a bit if that's
&gt;&gt; okay. So first of all, I didn't get a
 
&gt;&gt; okay. So first of all, I didn't get a
call to demo this so my ego is
 
call to demo this so my ego is
personally hurt um from not being one of
 
personally hurt um from not being one of
the early customers
 
the early customers
&gt;&gt; afterwards.
 
&gt;&gt; afterwards.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
&gt;&gt; don't don't worry about that, Mark.
 
&gt;&gt; don't don't worry about that, Mark.
Okay. So, when you say from intake,
 
Okay. So, when you say from intake,
right, to source to message,
 
right, to source to message,
&gt;&gt; that makes sense.
 
&gt;&gt; that makes sense.
&gt;&gt; What I've seen other companies
 
&gt;&gt; What I've seen other companies
potentially even now competitors as you
 
potentially even now competitors as you
guys expand into this space,
 
guys expand into this space,
&gt;&gt; try and do
 
&gt;&gt; try and do
&gt;&gt; is essentially go from intake
 
&gt;&gt; is essentially go from intake
immediately to JavaScription, right?
 
immediately to JavaScription, right?
Typically like recording that meeting
 
Typically like recording that meeting
using AI to then generate the job
 
using AI to then generate the job
description.
 
description.
&gt;&gt; Is that right? on the intake piece is
 
&gt;&gt; Is that right? on the intake piece is
that's how you guys are thinking about
 
that's how you guys are thinking about
it.
 
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, think about it more of the writing
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, think about it more of the writing
of the job wreck um you know can happen
 
of the job wreck um you know can happen
still outside of the system like the
 
still outside of the system like the
intake process. What I mean by that is a
 
intake process. What I mean by that is a
recruiter meets with a hiring manager
 
recruiter meets with a hiring manager
and they go through what the
 
and they go through what the
qualifications are. A job description
 
qualifications are. A job description
may have already been written. They may
 
may have already been written. They may
try to be backfill someone and like we
 
try to be backfill someone and like we
want to hire someone exactly like Susie
 
want to hire someone exactly like Susie
Johnson. And so the intake process is
 
Johnson. And so the intake process is
you can start with one of those three
 
you can start with one of those three
things. take the JD uh put Suzie into
 
things. take the JD uh put Suzie into
the intake process or you can just write
 
the intake process or you can just write
in regular language. I'm looking for a
 
in regular language. I'm looking for a
global head of product marketing. They
 
global head of product marketing. They
ideally had worked for companies in this
 
ideally had worked for companies in this
industry. They've also had experience
 
industry. They've also had experience
working with cross functional partners
 
working with cross functional partners
conversational. And then what hiring
 
conversational. And then what hiring
assistant will do will be able to
 
assistant will do will be able to
through uh basically a chat interface.
 
through uh basically a chat interface.
So it'll ask further qualifying
 
So it'll ask further qualifying
questions. It'll then translate that
 
questions. It'll then translate that
into the wreck or the qualifications
 
into the wreck or the qualifications
that hiring assistant will then use to
 
that hiring assistant will then use to
look across LinkedIn to be able to find
 
look across LinkedIn to be able to find
the ideal candidate. So that's kind of
 
the ideal candidate. So that's kind of
the first step when we get into road
 
the first step when we get into road
map. I can share a little bit more about
 
map. I can share a little bit more about
what else LinkedIn a hiring assistant is
 
what else LinkedIn a hiring assistant is
going to be able to look at as relates
 
going to be able to look at as relates
to candidates.
 
to candidates.
&gt;&gt; Got it. Okay. So then we get the JD done
 
&gt;&gt; Got it. Okay. So then we get the JD done
and then what I would assume happens
 
and then what I would assume happens
from a desired user experience
 
from a desired user experience
standpoint is you take LinkedIn now with
 
standpoint is you take LinkedIn now with
my JD
 
my JD
&gt;&gt; can then agentically or automatically,
 
&gt;&gt; can then agentically or automatically,
however you want to describe it, go and
 
however you want to describe it, go and
source the billion people that are
 
source the billion people that are
already on LinkedIn.
 
already on LinkedIn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And begin to proactively surface
 
&gt;&gt; And begin to proactively surface
candidates for me.
 
candidates for me.
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly right.
 
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly right.
There's a few steps in kind of sourcing
 
There's a few steps in kind of sourcing
and recruiting that take a lot of time.
 
and recruiting that take a lot of time.
The first is make sure the requirements
 
The first is make sure the requirements
are accurate. You know, no shortcuts.
 
are accurate. You know, no shortcuts.
This is not just like an advertisement
 
This is not just like an advertisement
like what are the real qualifications
 
like what are the real qualifications
you need with a level of specificity uh
 
you need with a level of specificity uh
to be able to find the right candidates.
 
to be able to find the right candidates.
So, one of the key learnings that we've
 
So, one of the key learnings that we've
had is like that first step is really
 
had is like that first step is really
important to make sure you get the
 
important to make sure you get the
qualifications right. That next step
 
qualifications right. That next step
though to go from getting the
 
though to go from getting the
requirements right to actually looking
 
requirements right to actually looking
into LinkedIn recruiter to find the
 
into LinkedIn recruiter to find the
right candidate can take a long time.
 
right candidate can take a long time.
And so once you go through that process,
 
And so once you go through that process,
this is what kind of where the magic of
 
this is what kind of where the magic of
an agentic product happens, which is it
 
an agentic product happens, which is it
will then get to work on your behalf.
 
will then get to work on your behalf.
And if it's an easy search, the results
 
And if it's an easy search, the results
will come back quickly. Otherwise, it'll
 
will come back quickly. Otherwise, it'll
be like, "Hey, go get a cup of coffee,
 
be like, "Hey, go get a cup of coffee,
meet with your hiring manager, and we'll
 
meet with your hiring manager, and we'll
come back when we have a vetted list of
 
come back when we have a vetted list of
top applicant or top candidates." Then
 
top applicant or top candidates." Then
you get to the next step of the process,
 
you get to the next step of the process,
which is the top candidates that hiring
 
which is the top candidates that hiring
assistant has showed. And it's not just
 
assistant has showed. And it's not just
showing the candidates, it's actually
 
showing the candidates, it's actually
telling you exactly why they're a top
 
telling you exactly why they're a top
candidate. So, you get a lot more
 
candidate. So, you get a lot more
confidence that the candidates are the
 
confidence that the candidates are the
right ones. And the magic here actually
 
right ones. And the magic here actually
appears to be like the calibration can
 
appears to be like the calibration can
happen under these cycles. Like the
 
happen under these cycles. Like the
feedback cycles are so much shorter. I
 
feedback cycles are so much shorter. I
used to say at Door Dash is like every
 
used to say at Door Dash is like every
hiring manager had this like purple
 
hiring manager had this like purple
squirrel syndrome.
 
squirrel syndrome.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; To where it'd be like great like you
 
&gt;&gt; To where it'd be like great like you
want like you know they went to Stanford
 
want like you know they went to Stanford
uh you know they married the prince of
 
uh you know they married the prince of
Abu Dhabi uh and you know like they're
 
Abu Dhabi uh and you know like they're
one of the top AI researchers in the
 
one of the top AI researchers in the
world
 
world
&gt;&gt; easy.
 
&gt;&gt; easy.
&gt;&gt; And it's like great like go search for
 
&gt;&gt; And it's like great like go search for
that person and then come back and tell
 
that person and then come back and tell
is what I would always tell him is like
 
is what I would always tell him is like
we this person doesn't exist. Yeah,
 
we this person doesn't exist. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; now it feels like hiring managers are
 
&gt;&gt; now it feels like hiring managers are
going to be able to do that
 
going to be able to do that
&gt;&gt; on their own timeline in a much faster
 
&gt;&gt; on their own timeline in a much faster
feedback loop than having to waste the
 
feedback loop than having to waste the
recruiting team's time. I don't think
 
recruiting team's time. I don't think
this gets rid of recruiting.
 
this gets rid of recruiting.
&gt;&gt; I just think it actually speeds up the
 
&gt;&gt; I just think it actually speeds up the
hiring manager's ability to get to truth
 
hiring manager's ability to get to truth
on what is available like in the
 
on what is available like in the
marketplace today. Is that does that
 
marketplace today. Is that does that
sound right to you?
 
sound right to you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I think there could be a
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I think there could be a
potential use case where hiring managers
 
potential use case where hiring managers
could be doing a lot more of the work.
 
could be doing a lot more of the work.
What we've heard from users and
 
What we've heard from users and
customers is not around how hiring
 
customers is not around how hiring
managers could use this, but how can you
 
managers could use this, but how can you
use this to have a better partnership
 
use this to have a better partnership
with hiring managers. And so, one of the
 
with hiring managers. And so, one of the
things that we often hear from uh
 
things that we often hear from uh
recruiters is that they just don't have
 
recruiters is that they just don't have
enough time in the day to be able to
 
enough time in the day to be able to
spend um what they love to do, which is
 
spend um what they love to do, which is
they want to spend more time with
 
they want to spend more time with
candidates. They want to spend more time
 
candidates. They want to spend more time
with their hiring managers to align on
 
with their hiring managers to align on
what the hiring manager is looking for.
 
what the hiring manager is looking for.
And so our real focus it is around how
 
And so our real focus it is around how
can hiring assistant help recruiters do
 
can hiring assistant help recruiters do
what they love. There's this like
 
what they love. There's this like
amazing quote that we heard a couple of
 
amazing quote that we heard a couple of
years ago when we were doing some user
 
years ago when we were doing some user
research and a recruiter said, "I love
 
research and a recruiter said, "I love
my job and I hate my day." Because so
 
my job and I hate my day." Because so
much of their day is spent on these
 
much of their day is spent on these
repetitive tasks that technology can
 
repetitive tasks that technology can
play a better role to help them make
 
play a better role to help them make
more make them more efficient so they
 
more make them more efficient so they
can actually build better partnerships
 
can actually build better partnerships
with hiring managers so they can
 
with hiring managers so they can
actually get the requirements right. So,
 
actually get the requirements right. So,
the tools can help with finding the
 
the tools can help with finding the
right candidates, even messaging those
 
right candidates, even messaging those
candidates. So, then you can actually
 
candidates. So, then you can actually
spend time with the right candidates and
 
spend time with the right candidates and
a greater partnership with a hiring
 
a greater partnership with a hiring
manager.

I was just going to say, I mean, the
recruiting function, just in my
 
recruiting function, just in my
experience, you know, leading people
 
experience, you know, leading people
teams for a while, it it can be that
 
teams for a while, it it can be that
function that's like out there like
 
function that's like out there like
Pluto in the universe, and they're just
 
Pluto in the universe, and they're just
out there shifting through resumes and
 
out there shifting through resumes and
trying to fill these orders that seem to
 
trying to fill these orders that seem to
never
 
never
&gt;&gt; stop coming in.
 
&gt;&gt; stop coming in.
&gt;&gt; And to your point, they complain because
 
&gt;&gt; And to your point, they complain because
they're, you know, drowning all day in
 
they're, you know, drowning all day in
that. And the reason they're not viewed
 
that. And the reason they're not viewed
as that partner is because they don't
 
as that partner is because they don't
have time to spend time talking about
 
have time to spend time talking about
the organization, the business, where
 
the organization, the business, where
it's going, how the workforce plan
 
it's going, how the workforce plan
connects to that. Do you know the org
 
connects to that. Do you know the org
design? Do you know what's happening
 
design? Do you know what's happening
culturally in these organizations which
 
culturally in these organizations which
impact how you find talent? You know,
 
impact how you find talent? You know,
one of my first questions is what's your
 
one of my first questions is what's your
cadence with your people partner leader
 
cadence with your people partner leader
and your organization leader and you
 
and your organization leader and you
what what do you do? And usually it's
 
what what do you do? And usually it's
not much. So,
 
not much. So,
&gt;&gt; I think it's not just about not liking
 
&gt;&gt; I think it's not just about not liking
the stuff, but the things that they need
 
the stuff, but the things that they need
to start doing to be viewed in that
 
to start doing to be viewed in that
manner. It should be it should be much
 
manner. It should be it should be much
you know higher level. Um, I did have
 
you know higher level. Um, I did have
one practical assumption I wanted to
 
one practical assumption I wanted to
bring up and it triggered me cuz last
 
bring up and it triggered me cuz last
week I was talking to someone and
 
week I was talking to someone and
coincidentally they said, "Yeah, my
 
coincidentally they said, "Yeah, my
LinkedIn I've never," we were talking
 
LinkedIn I've never," we were talking
about his career development and you
 
about his career development and you
know what a next role might look like
 
know what a next role might look like
and blah blah blah and he said, "Yeah,
 
and blah blah blah and he said, "Yeah,
I've never once had a bullet on my
 
I've never once had a bullet on my
LinkedIn. It's just the job." And
 
LinkedIn. It's just the job." And
thinking through how hiring assistant
 
thinking through how hiring assistant
works, I would assume a really really
 
works, I would assume a really really
solid piece of advice for candidates is
 
solid piece of advice for candidates is
to actually build out your profile and
 
to actually build out your profile and
make sure those bullets under your roles
 
make sure those bullets under your roles
are succinct are, you know,
 
are succinct are, you know,
representative of what you do because if
 
representative of what you do because if
you don't have that,
 
you don't have that,
&gt;&gt; I feel like you could get missed with
 
&gt;&gt; I feel like you could get missed with
this new technology and process.
 
this new technology and process.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say that's accurate. I
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say that's accurate. I
mean the good news is the way kind of
 
mean the good news is the way kind of
the search and kind of matching works
 
the search and kind of matching works
now it's a lot more than title and kind
 
now it's a lot more than title and kind
of work experience and so we can look
 
of work experience and so we can look
through skills we can look at the way
 
through skills we can look at the way
you describe what you did in certain
 
you describe what you did in certain

&gt;&gt; You got to have that out there.
 
&gt;&gt; You got to have that out there.
&gt;&gt; I don't think I have skills
 
&gt;&gt; I don't think I have skills
&gt;&gt; on my LinkedIn as one example. Nolan, do
 
&gt;&gt; on my LinkedIn as one example. Nolan, do
you? But
 
you? But
&gt;&gt; well, it's it's basically the stuff that
 
&gt;&gt; well, it's it's basically the stuff that
I think LinkedIn has supplanted the
 
I think LinkedIn has supplanted the
resume over the course of the last 5 to
 
resume over the course of the last 5 to
 
be like the the bullet in the head of
 
be like the the bullet in the head of
the resume because it doesn't make sense
 
the resume because it doesn't make sense
to have it anymore. LinkedIn can't know
 
to have it anymore. LinkedIn can't know
all of these things that we're talking
 
all of these things that we're talking
about. unless it's on LinkedIn. And so
 
about. unless it's on LinkedIn. And so
it doesn't make sense anymore to have
 
it doesn't make sense anymore to have
basically like two different contexts of
 
basically like two different contexts of
like, oh, my resume says this, but my
 
like, oh, my resume says this, but my
LinkedIn says this. Like, if you want to
 
LinkedIn says this. Like, if you want to
be found
 
be found
&gt;&gt; as a passive candidate,
 
&gt;&gt; as a passive candidate,
&gt;&gt; like you have to have it on your
 
&gt;&gt; like you have to have it on your
LinkedIn. Is that right, Mark?
 
LinkedIn. Is that right, Mark?
&gt;&gt; That's my point, though. A lot of people
 
&gt;&gt; That's my point, though. A lot of people
don't, and like I don't have skills
 
don't, and like I don't have skills
listed on LinkedIn.
 
listed on LinkedIn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you do, but that that's
 
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you do, but that that's
a takeaway that I have here is a lot of
 
a takeaway that I have here is a lot of
people, you'd be surprised, don't have
 
people, you'd be surprised, don't have
that built out very much.
 
that built out very much.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Is that going to be like day zero
 
&gt;&gt; Wow. Is that going to be like day zero
product launch or coming later with
 
product launch or coming later with
additional feature sets?
 
additional feature sets?
&gt;&gt; Uh so we're working with all of our ATS
 
&gt;&gt; Uh so we're working with all of our ATS
partners right now on this. We will
 
partners right now on this. We will
likely be announcing some partners as we
 
likely be announcing some partners as we
get closer to GI and over time the goal
 
get closer to GI and over time the goal
is to help our customers based on what
 
is to help our customers based on what
they're looking for. Have hiring
 
they're looking for. Have hiring
assistant be able to work across you
 
assistant be able to work across you
know the ATS players. Today we have a
 
know the ATS players. Today we have a
product an integration called recruiter
 
product an integration called recruiter
system connect. So, it's the ability
 
system connect. So, it's the ability
when you're in the ATS to see LinkedIn
 
when you're in the ATS to see LinkedIn
profile information. When you're in
 
profile information. When you're in
recruiter, I'll be able to see if
 
recruiter, I'll be able to see if
they're in your ATS. Like, all of it's
 
they're in your ATS. Like, all of it's
about making recruiters more kind of
 
about making recruiters more kind of
efficient in their job, less like job
 
efficient in their job, less like job
like seat swiveling, if you will.
 
like seat swiveling, if you will.
&gt;&gt; So, think about this as like the next
 
&gt;&gt; So, think about this as like the next
kind of generation of that integration.
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So what I see happening here with
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So what I see happening here with
this product launch mark is
 
this product launch mark is
uh I'm going to just frame it and then
 
uh I'm going to just frame it and then
I'll get into it is the beginning of the
 
I'll get into it is the beginning of the
end of sourcing. Right? So which by the
 
end of sourcing. Right? So which by the
way I hate I don't like sourcing. I
 
way I hate I don't like sourcing. I
don't think even sourcers really enjoy
 
don't think even sourcers really enjoy
sourcing. Um but kind of similar to what
 
sourcing. Um but kind of similar to what
we saw with coordination right before it
 
we saw with coordination right before it
was you would have a coordinator that
 
was you would have a coordinator that
coordinator would get the candidates
 
coordinator would get the candidates
availability and get all the teams

the middle to like figure out like when
people could meet which was me early in
 
people could meet which was me early in
my career by the way. Then you had
 
my career by the way. Then you had
kalanly now you have all sorts of tools
 
kalanly now you have all sorts of tools
like um good time and others that are
 
like um good time and others that are
doing this. This makes me feel like with
 
doing this. This makes me feel like with
the advent of this,
 
the advent of this,
&gt;&gt; almost everybody is on LinkedIn. You
 
&gt;&gt; almost everybody is on LinkedIn. You
know, call it like 97% of the people who
 
know, call it like 97% of the people who
I would ever like even try and find are
 
I would ever like even try and find are
on LinkedIn. And so would you agree now
 
on LinkedIn. And so would you agree now
that sourcing is going to become much
 
that sourcing is going to become much
more of a bespoke thing like when you're
 
more of a bespoke thing like when you're
really looking for needles in the hay
 
really looking for needles in the hay

which is what good recruiters do.
 
which is what good recruiters do.
&gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
 
&gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say it's uh hard to
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say it's uh hard to
predict the future. What I'm seeing and
 
predict the future. What I'm seeing and
hearing based upon my customer
 
hearing based upon my customer

know leaders of tal acquisition, CHRO's
 
know leaders of tal acquisition, CHRO's
is that the way they're thinking about
 
is that the way they're thinking about
it and like the way they're actually
 
it and like the way they're actually
making changes like literally real time
 
making changes like literally real time
to their teams is that they are not at
 
to their teams is that they are not at
this point and every company's
 
this point and every company's
different, right? Some teams have
 
different, right? Some teams have
sorcerers, some teams don't, some teams
 
sorcerers, some teams don't, some teams
have people that do everything. But what
 
have people that do everything. But what
I'm hearing so far, and I would say this
 
I'm hearing so far, and I would say this
is likely to be the case in the months
 
is likely to be the case in the months
and quarters ahead, TBD years ahead
 
and quarters ahead, TBD years ahead
because everything's moving so fast is
 
because everything's moving so fast is
exactly what you said as it relates to
 
exactly what you said as it relates to
being able to focus on higher value
 
being able to focus on higher value
activities. So I spoke to one of our
 
activities. So I spoke to one of our
charter customers. They're doing
 
charter customers. They're doing
fantastic. It's one of the biggest
 
fantastic. It's one of the biggest
global construction and engineering
 
global construction and engineering
companies in the world and someone I've
 
companies in the world and someone I've
had a relationship with a partnership
 
had a relationship with a partnership
with for a number of years. And I gave
 
with for a number of years. And I gave
this person a call and said, "How are
 
this person a call and said, "How are
things going?" And their take was that
 
things going?" And their take was that
we're seeing a completely different
 
we're seeing a completely different
level of performance and capabilities by
 
level of performance and capabilities by
the recruiters that are using hiring
 
the recruiters that are using hiring
assistant on a regular basis.

Unsurprisingly, what's the hardest part
 
Unsurprisingly, what's the hardest part
about customers using Ajentic Tech? It's
 
about customers using Ajentic Tech? It's
change management. Like without a doubt,
 
change management. Like without a doubt,
it's not just new tech, it's changing
 
it's not just new tech, it's changing
workflows. But for the users that are
 
workflows. But for the users that are
using this product like step change
 
using this product like step change
effectiveness, finding talent they
 
effectiveness, finding talent they
weren't able to find previously,
 
weren't able to find previously,
improving recruiter productivity, so
 
improving recruiter productivity, so
hero improvements and doing a search to
 
hero improvements and doing a search to
sending an inmail. Like the metrics are
 
sending an inmail. Like the metrics are
proving that there's a next level of
 
proving that there's a next level of
recruiter effectiveness. But ultimately
 
recruiter effectiveness. But ultimately
the reason that they were so excited is
 
the reason that they were so excited is
to your point of being able to spend
 
to your point of being able to spend
more time with candidates. So they
 
more time with candidates. So they
recruit for very hard to fill positions
 
recruit for very hard to fill positions
that are like make or break the company
 
that are like make or break the company
but incredibly hard and every other
 
but incredibly hard and every other
competitor is trying to recruit the same
 
competitor is trying to recruit the same
people. So what they've done is they've
 
people. So what they've done is they've
now freed up the recruiters that are
 
now freed up the recruiters that are
focusing on these candidates and so
 
focusing on these candidates and so
they're like automating this intake and
 
they're like automating this intake and
sourcing and messaging part and they've
 
sourcing and messaging part and they've
now freed up their time to actually
 
now freed up their time to actually
spend more time with candidates. And so
 
spend more time with candidates. And so
I think it goes back to like we're in
 
I think it goes back to like we're in
this place right now where even if your
 
this place right now where even if your
job doesn't change like the skills
 
job doesn't change like the skills
required to do your job effectively is
 
required to do your job effectively is
going to change. And so while some roles
 
going to change. And so while some roles
may get smaller some may roles get
 
may get smaller some may roles get
bigger I think every role is going to
 
bigger I think every role is going to
change in a pretty fundamental way uh
 
change in a pretty fundamental way uh
first with generative and now with a
 
first with generative and now with a
gentic tech
 
gentic tech
&gt;&gt; makes total sense to me. I mean the
 
&gt;&gt; makes total sense to me. I mean the
analog for RC's I think is going to hold
 
analog for RC's I think is going to hold
here which is sorcerers aren't going to
 
here which is sorcerers aren't going to
go to go away entirely but like 90% of
 
go to go away entirely but like 90% of
that job should be done by you guys.
 
that job should be done by you guys.
It's way better. You guys are way better
 
It's way better. You guys are way better
at this than we are. And this, you know,
 
at this than we are. And this, you know,
kind of goes back to my point earlier on
 
kind of goes back to my point earlier on
purple squirrel searches.
 
purple squirrel searches.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; When hiring managers would come to us
 
&gt;&gt; When hiring managers would come to us
and ask for these crazy requirements,
 
and ask for these crazy requirements,
&gt;&gt; it was typically always like us being
 
&gt;&gt; it was typically always like us being
like, "Guys, like this is not possible."
 
like, "Guys, like this is not possible."
And then they'd be like, "Well, you guys
 
And then they'd be like, "Well, you guys
have a skill issue. Maybe you guys
 
have a skill issue. Maybe you guys
aren't good enough at sourcing."
 
aren't good enough at sourcing."
&gt;&gt; And actually, I think this is such a
 
&gt;&gt; And actually, I think this is such a
better experience for all sides of the
 
better experience for all sides of the
table, which is great. Guess what? We
 
table, which is great. Guess what? We
have a neutral arbiter. It turns out
 
have a neutral arbiter. It turns out
it's LinkedIn. You may have heard of
 
it's LinkedIn. You may have heard of
them.
 
them.
&gt;&gt; And they're going to source for us
 
&gt;&gt; And they're going to source for us
&gt;&gt; because they're the best at this.
 
&gt;&gt; because they're the best at this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like this is I think what everybody
 
&gt;&gt; Like this is I think what everybody
wants. And I think ultimately we'll have
 
wants. And I think ultimately we'll have
uh I really think it's about these
 
uh I really think it's about these
feedback cycles.
 
feedback cycles.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and these calibration cycles
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and these calibration cycles
because then you're going to put those
 
because then you're going to put those
requirements in and be like, "Oh
 
requirements in and be like, "Oh
nobody's or like no, you know, there's
 
nobody's or like no, you know, there's
five people and then the my my next
 
five people and then the my my next
favorite part too is you guys have gone
 
favorite part too is you guys have gone
to the messaging piece which is go send
 
to the messaging piece which is go send
a message, see if they get back to you."
 
a message, see if they get back to you."
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. Because it turns out if you're
 
&gt;&gt; Right. Because it turns out if you're
looking for these five people,
 
looking for these five people,
&gt;&gt; there's probably a few other companies
 
&gt;&gt; there's probably a few other companies
that might be looking for those folks as
 
that might be looking for those folks as
well and they get messaged all the time.
 
well and they get messaged all the time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it becomes a how do we
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it becomes a how do we
stand out sort of a thing because just
 
stand out sort of a thing because just
because you can find them doesn't mean
 
because you can find them doesn't mean
that they want to work at your company.
 
that they want to work at your company.
&gt;&gt; That's right.
 
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; I was asking myself a question in my
 
&gt;&gt; I was asking myself a question in my
head and trying to answer it. Maybe
 
head and trying to answer it. Maybe
Nolan both of you. Something that I'm
 
Nolan both of you. Something that I'm
hearing a lot and we heard last week is
 
hearing a lot and we heard last week is
just the overwhelmingness of all these
 
just the overwhelmingness of all these
tools coming out, all this new lovely
 
tools coming out, all this new lovely
loveliness that's coming out. And it's
 
loveliness that's coming out. And it's
so much that it's actually now
 
so much that it's actually now
paralyzing people and they're choosing
 
paralyzing people and they're choosing
kind of not to use sometimes because of
 
kind of not to use sometimes because of
it. What what fast forward 18 months, 24
 
it. What what fast forward 18 months, 24
months, like what what tools out there,
 
months, like what what tools out there,
Nolan, Mark, does this replace? Like if
 
Nolan, Mark, does this replace? Like if
I'm listening to this and I've got six
 
I'm listening to this and I've got six
other things or demos going on, how do I
 
other things or demos going on, how do I
think about my arsenal of AI tools or
 
think about my arsenal of AI tools or
platforms with this? As it relates to
 
platforms with this? As it relates to
partners and which tool to use and the
 
partners and which tool to use and the
different part of the kind of tech stack
 
different part of the kind of tech stack
that a company deploys, I'd say there's
 
that a company deploys, I'd say there's
probably a couple things like everyone
 
probably a couple things like everyone
should kind of think about before they
 
should kind of think about before they
make a final call on like what partner
 
make a final call on like what partner
for what part of the kind of TA tech
 
for what part of the kind of TA tech
stack and you can make a htm and then
 
stack and you can make a htm and then
kind of ATS and then on top of that like
 
kind of ATS and then on top of that like
pre-screening tools and then where your
 
pre-screening tools and then where your
actual sourcing tools if you have a CRM
 
actual sourcing tools if you have a CRM
etc. But I think that the main things
 
etc. But I think that the main things
that I hear from customers on what
 
that I hear from customers on what
matters to them is show don't tell. And
 
matters to them is show don't tell. And
so there's a lot of tools out there that
 
so there's a lot of tools out there that
say it does what the this marketing
 
say it does what the this marketing
slide says and when they actually like
 
slide says and when they actually like
kick the tires on it, it doesn't do
 
kick the tires on it, it doesn't do
anything remotely close to that or it's
 
anything remotely close to that or it's
actually not that accurate. So that's
 
actually not that accurate. So that's
like one, make sure you're going through
 
like one, make sure you're going through
that vetting process. Part of that also
 
that vetting process. Part of that also
is it's really interesting time right
 
is it's really interesting time right
now with how tools are being built and
 
now with how tools are being built and
what access to data people have and
 
what access to data people have and
what's a responsible use, what's not a
 
what's a responsible use, what's not a
responsible use, how is the data being
 
responsible use, how is the data being
stored. And so what I hear from a lot of
 
stored. And so what I hear from a lot of
customers that obviously want to ensure
 
customers that obviously want to ensure
that they're working with a partner that
 
that they're working with a partner that
is kind of trusted, handling their data
 
is kind of trusted, handling their data
responsibly, that there's a set of
 
responsibly, that there's a set of
responsible AI principles and how they
 
responsible AI principles and how they
build it is kind of another piece. Uh
 
build it is kind of another piece. Uh
but ultimately it's you know how can
 
but ultimately it's you know how can
this tool ideally fit within kind of
 
this tool ideally fit within kind of
their workflow that exists today. And so
 
their workflow that exists today. And so
that's like one of the reasons we made a
 
that's like one of the reasons we made a
very deliberate choice with the way we
 
very deliberate choice with the way we
built hiring assistant. So the way
 
built hiring assistant. So the way
hiring assistant works, it's actually
 
hiring assistant works, it's actually
built into the flow of the work of a
 
built into the flow of the work of a
recruiter today. So it actually works
 
recruiter today. So it actually works
alongside the recruiter product. And so
 
alongside the recruiter product. And so
there's a lot of familiarity with the
 
there's a lot of familiarity with the
concepts. And so you want to think about
 
concepts. And so you want to think about
like kind of the flow of work and then
 
like kind of the flow of work and then
does it integrate across the rest of
 
does it integrate across the rest of
your tech stack. So it's definitely like
 
your tech stack. So it's definitely like
a checklist, but those are some of the
 
a checklist, but those are some of the
things that I hear most frequently from
 
things that I hear most frequently from
customers.
 
customers.
&gt;&gt; Mark, who gets access to this? Is this
 
&gt;&gt; Mark, who gets access to this? Is this
for the
 
for the
&gt;&gt; like the big big recruiter seat or does
 
&gt;&gt; like the big big recruiter seat or does
recruiter light get access to this? Does
 
recruiter light get access to this? Does
sales get access?
 
sales get access?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so recruiter uh customers. So
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so recruiter uh customers. So
customers that we work with with our
 
customers that we work with with our
client-f facing teams will have access
 
client-f facing teams will have access
to this at the end of September when it

will be globally available. So that's
when folks will be able to actually
 
when folks will be able to actually
access it. There's another kind of
 
access it. There's another kind of
question is can you access it? But then
 
question is can you access it? But then
it's are we ready to be able to use it?
 
it's are we ready to be able to use it?
And so we really helped our client
 
And so we really helped our client
facing teams be able to work with
 
facing teams be able to work with
customers to help them understand like
 
customers to help them understand like
where they are with their ability to use
 
where they are with their ability to use
this product effectively. So we've
 
this product effectively. So we've
learned so much during this charter
 
learned so much during this charter
process. You know, one of the key
 
process. You know, one of the key
learnings through charter outside of
 
learnings through charter outside of
like change management will be real. And

requirements of power recruiter users is
 
requirements of power recruiter users is
not a trivial task, especially when
 
not a trivial task, especially when
you're doing it in a safe and trusted
 
you're doing it in a safe and trusted
way. But change management. And then the
 
way. But change management. And then the
last one with regards to like getting
 
last one with regards to like getting
people ready is are they going to be
 
people ready is are they going to be
ready to actually like use the product?
 
ready to actually like use the product?
And so we worked so closely with
 
And so we worked so closely with
recruiter users to co-create this
 
recruiter users to co-create this
almost. We don't want to create it in a
 
almost. We don't want to create it in a
lab and like ship it out and be like,
 
lab and like ship it out and be like,
"Oh, this isn't how people actually want
 
"Oh, this isn't how people actually want
to use it." So, we've got to co-create
 
to use it." So, we've got to co-create
it with our users to make sure that we
 
it with our users to make sure that we
have real product market fit and how
 
have real product market fit and how
actual users want to use the product.
 
actual users want to use the product.
&gt;&gt; Makes sense. Um, last thing before we
 
&gt;&gt; Makes sense. Um, last thing before we
let you go, Mark, uh, because you said
 
let you go, Mark, uh, because you said
it and I saw both Kelly and I kind of
 
it and I saw both Kelly and I kind of
looked at each other on you, you'd
 
looked at each other on you, you'd
mentioned open to work.
 
mentioned open to work.
And I've taken I think probably the most
 
And I've taken I think probably the most
heat of anybody on the internet for
 
heat of anybody on the internet for
being critical about the banner.
 
being critical about the banner.
&gt;&gt; Um I know you guys have data that says
 
&gt;&gt; Um I know you guys have data that says
that open to work has been generally
 
that open to work has been generally
helpful. Would you agree that there is
 
helpful. Would you agree that there is
especially in tech
 
especially in tech
uh hiring manager and CEO bias that
 
uh hiring manager and CEO bias that
exists for people who use the banner?
 
exists for people who use the banner?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I I can understand that
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I I can understand that
perception. what I see and what uh when
 
perception. what I see and what uh when
I in the data and then when I speak to
 
I in the data and then when I speak to
actual users it's much more like not
 
actual users it's much more like not
clearly a bad thing. So we obviously
 
clearly a bad thing. So we obviously
take lots of feedback we look at seekers
 
take lots of feedback we look at seekers
we look at the data and we have found it
 
we look at the data and we have found it
to be kind of a net positive overall as
 
to be kind of a net positive overall as
it relates to not just the job seeker
 
it relates to not just the job seeker
experience but actually with hiring. uh
 
experience but actually with hiring. uh
there's a lot of incredibly quality
 
there's a lot of incredibly quality
talented people in the world that are
 
talented people in the world that are
looking for work and it's just an
 
looking for work and it's just an
important signal to be able to send it
 
important signal to be able to send it
out for recruiters to be able to find
 
out for recruiters to be able to find
those people.
 
those people.
&gt;&gt; To end on a maybe a humorous note here,
 
&gt;&gt; To end on a maybe a humorous note here,
Nolan also I think went down a dark
 
Nolan also I think went down a dark
rabbit hole asking for feedback from
 
rabbit hole asking for feedback from
chat GPT on his profile picture and the
 
chat GPT on his profile picture and the
background. Mark, I mean I don't know if
 
background. Mark, I mean I don't know if
you have any reactions to this, but I
 
you have any reactions to this, but I
was a little shocked. I mean, you spent
 
was a little shocked. I mean, you spent
what hours? an hour on this asking it
 
what hours? an hour on this asking it
questions. I did not. No, I spent 10
 
questions. I did not. No, I spent 10
minutes. This is like I think this is
 
minutes. This is like I think this is
the biggest miscon even I spent 10
 
the biggest miscon even I spent 10
minutes you looking at it for four
 
minutes you looking at it for four
people who were curious about it. But
 
people who were curious about it. But
Mark, don't you think that that's
 
Mark, don't you think that that's
actually a good use of like given how
 
actually a good use of like given how
important your LinkedIn profile is if
 
important your LinkedIn profile is if
it's replacing the resume? If we all
 
it's replacing the resume? If we all
agree by the end of this call, right,
 
agree by the end of this call, right,
one of the things that humans look at is
 
one of the things that humans look at is
the profile picture. Whether or not we
 
the profile picture. Whether or not we
like that is a separate thing. And so
 
like that is a separate thing. And so
using chat GBT to give you feedback on
 
using chat GBT to give you feedback on
your profile picture is something I did
 
your profile picture is something I did
recently. What's your take on that?
 
recently. What's your take on that?
&gt;&gt; I've never done it myself. I wouldn't
 
&gt;&gt; I've never done it myself. I wouldn't
say I have a informed take on it outside
 
say I have a informed take on it outside
of I probably speak with chat GBT as
 
of I probably speak with chat GBT as
well as co-pilot maybe a dozen times a
 
well as co-pilot maybe a dozen times a
day. So it makes sense you would ask for
 
day. So it makes sense you would ask for
some feedback.
 
some feedback.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I had to slip it in there just to seeing
 
&gt;&gt; I had to slip it in there just to seeing
reaction. So Nolan asking about
 
reaction. So Nolan asking about
feedback. I I had a good time with that
 
feedback. I I had a good time with that
with him. But in a serious note actually
 
with him. But in a serious note actually
a lot of people don't have a picture up
 
a lot of people don't have a picture up
&gt;&gt; for good reason and I understand that.
 
&gt;&gt; for good reason and I understand that.
Do you have any reaction to that
 
Do you have any reaction to that
decision?
 
decision?
&gt;&gt; Um well I mean everyone makes the choice
 
&gt;&gt; Um well I mean everyone makes the choice
based upon whatever they want to do. We
 
based upon whatever they want to do. We
do see uh improved connections in male
 
do see uh improved connections in male
sense when there is a profile but you
 
sense when there is a profile but you
know I understand some folks don't want
 
know I understand some folks don't want
to put their profile their picture in
 
to put their profile their picture in
their profile. One of the things that we
 
their profile. One of the things that we
take incredibly seriously, we always
 
take incredibly seriously, we always
have just given if you think about
 
have just given if you think about
LinkedIn, you know, it's all about do
 
LinkedIn, you know, it's all about do
members trust us? And so something we've
 
members trust us? And so something we've
always taken very seriously is do
 
always taken very seriously is do
members trust LinkedIn with their data.
 
members trust LinkedIn with their data.
Do they trust us with their profile? We
 
Do they trust us with their profile? We
always want to make what's available
 
always want to make what's available
consistent clarity. You want to give
 
consistent clarity. You want to give
them control. And so when you think
 
them control. And so when you think
about that, how do you build upon it?
 
about that, how do you build upon it?
thinking about bias is I assume you're
 
thinking about bias is I assume you're
kind of thinking about with the profile
 
kind of thinking about with the profile
picture is something that we've taken
 
picture is something that we've taken
very seriously for probably 15 years now
 
very seriously for probably 15 years now
