What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have Mark Labosco who is at LinkedIn
running talent solutions. What's up
Mark? It's nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; What's up? Good to be here. Nice to meet
you as well and Kelly. Thanks for having
us here Mark.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, Kelly, you know, you and
I were at a dinner on Thursday. I had to
be very careful about what I say because
we have a rule at these dinners, which
is we don't talk about them.
&gt;&gt; But it was the fight, it was the fight
club rule for
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I describe it as fight club.
But what I can say is that of the people
who attended, we had a very large
discussion on AI and
it shocks me that so many people still
are basically doing nothing. And so
Mark, LinkedIn should be one of the
players in this space. I think everyone
has been looking to LinkedIn being like,
"All right, like I use you every day,
multiple times a day." I think for me
specifically, like outside of Instagram,
LinkedIn probably gets the majority of
like my social usage. Uh, obviously this
is where we go to look for jobs, where
we on the recruiting side go and look
for candidates. So sounds like you guys
are launching a product in the space.
Can you tell us a little bit about it
and what's going on over there?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. Uh, well, first off,
that has been a lot of my experience as
well. So, you know, I co-lead our talent
business and spend a fair amount of my
time meeting with customers one-on-one,
hosting dinners, roundts. There's a real
spectrum of where customers are with
regards to, you know, AI adoption. And
AI adoption means different things. it's
general fluency with themselves or
across their function or across the
company or how are you using AI to
improve internal processes and it's
definitely not one sizefits-all.
So I've had a very very similar
experience. We're really excited about
hiring assistant. So hiring assistant is
LinkedIn's first agentic product and so
I'm sure you've heard about agents. So
the easiest way I kind of think about
agents is AI's been around for a long
time and there's been different kind of
stages of AI that's happened over the
years. There was you know machine
learning which was created matching deep
learning which improved upon that and
then a few years ago the world became
very familiar with chat GBT and then a
number of other similar platforms
generative AI it's all about creating
text and images even code and so we've
been along on this journey for a while
at LinkedIn and so if you think about
the core of LinkedIn we want to be able
to ensure members can find the
connections the jobs information in the
feed that is most relevant to them. So
matching has always been a very big deal
and it's helped improve product quality.
So we've been building AI into all of
our products from Flagship to LinkedIn
recruiter for like well over a decade.
And so because ultimately what we're
trying to do for our customers and
recruiting is we want their users to be
able to find the right candidate as
efficiently as possible. Uh a big big
moment happened for us in November of
 
been great being part of that
organization for a number of reasons,
but we were able to take an early look
at chatbt before the world had kind of
seen that latest model. And we
immediately left that meeting and said
we need to rethink the way in which we
could create value for our users and
members with this new technology.
And so short order after that meeting we
started to really revamp the way your
recruiter worked building in a lot of
these like generative AI features. So
think about AI assisted messaging or AI
assisted search you can have a more
conversation with recruiter to be able
to find the right set of candidates and
the results have been kind of undeniable
with even using those features. So like
 
example. But shortly after we started
building those features, we were looking
at what's next. So moving from
generative to kind of agentic and so
fortunately we have some of the best
kind of engineers, AI engineers in the
world. We have incredible access to
technology. And so we thought about
building this for a while. We actually
started building it probably about 15ish
months ago and we announced it and then
went into charter last October. And then
we've been meeting with our customers,
we've been learning with them to ensure
that we're building this product in a
way that will work for our customers. So
the way to think about what hiring
assistant is, if you think about each of
the steps in recruiting from intake all
the way to the person is hired and you
break that down into different steps.
We've been very focused with hiring
assistant for now and what will be
available at launch will be the intake
process, the actual searching for
candidates and then the messaging
process. So we've been looking laser
focused on those three steps and we can
talk road map in a bit if that's
&gt;&gt; okay. So first of all, I didn't get a
call to demo this so my ego is
personally hurt um from not being one of
the early customers
&gt;&gt; afterwards.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
&gt;&gt; don't don't worry about that, Mark.
Okay. So, when you say from intake,
right, to source to message,
&gt;&gt; that makes sense.
&gt;&gt; What I've seen other companies
potentially even now competitors as you
guys expand into this space,
&gt;&gt; try and do
&gt;&gt; is essentially go from intake
immediately to JavaScription, right?
Typically like recording that meeting
using AI to then generate the job
description.
&gt;&gt; Is that right? on the intake piece is
that's how you guys are thinking about
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, think about it more of the writing
of the job wreck um you know can happen
still outside of the system like the
intake process. What I mean by that is a
recruiter meets with a hiring manager
and they go through what the
qualifications are. A job description
may have already been written. They may
try to be backfill someone and like we
want to hire someone exactly like Susie
Johnson. And so the intake process is
you can start with one of those three
things. take the JD uh put Suzie into
the intake process or you can just write
in regular language. I'm looking for a
global head of product marketing. They
ideally had worked for companies in this
industry. They've also had experience
working with cross functional partners
conversational. And then what hiring
assistant will do will be able to
through uh basically a chat interface.
So it'll ask further qualifying
questions. It'll then translate that
into the wreck or the qualifications
that hiring assistant will then use to
look across LinkedIn to be able to find
the ideal candidate. So that's kind of
the first step when we get into road
map. I can share a little bit more about
what else LinkedIn a hiring assistant is
going to be able to look at as relates
to candidates.
&gt;&gt; Got it. Okay. So then we get the JD done
and then what I would assume happens
from a desired user experience
standpoint is you take LinkedIn now with
my JD
&gt;&gt; can then agentically or automatically,
however you want to describe it, go and
source the billion people that are
already on LinkedIn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And begin to proactively surface
candidates for me.
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly right.
There's a few steps in kind of sourcing
and recruiting that take a lot of time.
The first is make sure the requirements
are accurate. You know, no shortcuts.
This is not just like an advertisement
like what are the real qualifications
you need with a level of specificity uh
to be able to find the right candidates.
So, one of the key learnings that we've
had is like that first step is really
important to make sure you get the
qualifications right. That next step
though to go from getting the
requirements right to actually looking
into LinkedIn recruiter to find the
right candidate can take a long time.
And so once you go through that process,
this is what kind of where the magic of
an agentic product happens, which is it
will then get to work on your behalf.
And if it's an easy search, the results
will come back quickly. Otherwise, it'll
be like, "Hey, go get a cup of coffee,
meet with your hiring manager, and we'll
come back when we have a vetted list of
top applicant or top candidates." Then
you get to the next step of the process,
which is the top candidates that hiring
assistant has showed. And it's not just
showing the candidates, it's actually
telling you exactly why they're a top
candidate. So, you get a lot more
confidence that the candidates are the
right ones. And the magic here actually
appears to be like the calibration can
happen under these cycles. Like the
feedback cycles are so much shorter. I
used to say at Door Dash is like every
hiring manager had this like purple
squirrel syndrome.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; To where it'd be like great like you
want like you know they went to Stanford
uh you know they married the prince of
Abu Dhabi uh and you know like they're
one of the top AI researchers in the
world
&gt;&gt; easy.
&gt;&gt; And it's like great like go search for
that person and then come back and tell
is what I would always tell him is like
we this person doesn't exist. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; now it feels like hiring managers are
going to be able to do that
&gt;&gt; on their own timeline in a much faster
feedback loop than having to waste the
recruiting team's time. I don't think
this gets rid of recruiting.
&gt;&gt; I just think it actually speeds up the
hiring manager's ability to get to truth
on what is available like in the
marketplace today. Is that does that
sound right to you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I think there could be a
potential use case where hiring managers
could be doing a lot more of the work.
What we've heard from users and
customers is not around how hiring
managers could use this, but how can you
use this to have a better partnership
with hiring managers. And so, one of the
things that we often hear from uh
recruiters is that they just don't have
enough time in the day to be able to
spend um what they love to do, which is
they want to spend more time with
candidates. They want to spend more time
with their hiring managers to align on
what the hiring manager is looking for.
And so our real focus it is around how
can hiring assistant help recruiters do
what they love. There's this like
amazing quote that we heard a couple of
years ago when we were doing some user
research and a recruiter said, "I love
my job and I hate my day." Because so
much of their day is spent on these
repetitive tasks that technology can
play a better role to help them make
more make them more efficient so they
can actually build better partnerships
with hiring managers so they can
actually get the requirements right. So,
the tools can help with finding the
right candidates, even messaging those
candidates. So, then you can actually
spend time with the right candidates and
a greater partnership with a hiring
manager.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. MetaView is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metave suite of AI agents works for you
at every stage of the hiring process.
Their platform powers instant job postc
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metiv changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing

be up running and AI enabled in minutes.
I was just going to say, I mean, the
recruiting function, just in my
experience, you know, leading people
teams for a while, it it can be that
function that's like out there like
Pluto in the universe, and they're just
out there shifting through resumes and
trying to fill these orders that seem to
never
&gt;&gt; stop coming in.
&gt;&gt; And to your point, they complain because
they're, you know, drowning all day in
that. And the reason they're not viewed
as that partner is because they don't
have time to spend time talking about
the organization, the business, where
it's going, how the workforce plan
connects to that. Do you know the org
design? Do you know what's happening
culturally in these organizations which
impact how you find talent? You know,
one of my first questions is what's your
cadence with your people partner leader
and your organization leader and you
what what do you do? And usually it's
not much. So,
&gt;&gt; I think it's not just about not liking
the stuff, but the things that they need
to start doing to be viewed in that
manner. It should be it should be much
you know higher level. Um, I did have
one practical assumption I wanted to
bring up and it triggered me cuz last
week I was talking to someone and
coincidentally they said, "Yeah, my
LinkedIn I've never," we were talking
about his career development and you
know what a next role might look like
and blah blah blah and he said, "Yeah,
I've never once had a bullet on my
LinkedIn. It's just the job." And
thinking through how hiring assistant
works, I would assume a really really
solid piece of advice for candidates is
to actually build out your profile and
make sure those bullets under your roles
are succinct are, you know,
representative of what you do because if
you don't have that,
&gt;&gt; I feel like you could get missed with
this new technology and process.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say that's accurate. I
mean the good news is the way kind of
the search and kind of matching works
now it's a lot more than title and kind
of work experience and so we can look
through skills we can look at the way
you describe what you did in certain
roles so the example I mentioned before
looking for you know global head of
product marketing if someone describes
that they've worked crossf functionally
that they led a team of 200 product
marketers like that's the way the
matching becomes even more effective.
&gt;&gt; You got to have that out there.
&gt;&gt; I don't think I have skills
&gt;&gt; on my LinkedIn as one example. Nolan, do
you? But
&gt;&gt; well, it's it's basically the stuff that
I think LinkedIn has supplanted the
resume over the course of the last 5 to
 
be like the the bullet in the head of
the resume because it doesn't make sense
to have it anymore. LinkedIn can't know
all of these things that we're talking
about. unless it's on LinkedIn. And so
it doesn't make sense anymore to have
basically like two different contexts of
like, oh, my resume says this, but my
LinkedIn says this. Like, if you want to
be found
&gt;&gt; as a passive candidate,
&gt;&gt; like you have to have it on your
LinkedIn. Is that right, Mark?
&gt;&gt; That's my point, though. A lot of people
don't, and like I don't have skills
listed on LinkedIn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you do, but that that's
a takeaway that I have here is a lot of
people, you'd be surprised, don't have
that built out very much.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Is that going to be like day zero
product launch or coming later with
additional feature sets?
&gt;&gt; Uh so we're working with all of our ATS
partners right now on this. We will
likely be announcing some partners as we
get closer to GI and over time the goal
is to help our customers based on what
they're looking for. Have hiring
assistant be able to work across you
know the ATS players. Today we have a
product an integration called recruiter
system connect. So, it's the ability
when you're in the ATS to see LinkedIn
profile information. When you're in
recruiter, I'll be able to see if
they're in your ATS. Like, all of it's
about making recruiters more kind of
efficient in their job, less like job
like seat swiveling, if you will.
&gt;&gt; So, think about this as like the next
kind of generation of that integration.
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So what I see happening here with
this product launch mark is
uh I'm going to just frame it and then
I'll get into it is the beginning of the
end of sourcing. Right? So which by the
way I hate I don't like sourcing. I
don't think even sourcers really enjoy
sourcing. Um but kind of similar to what
we saw with coordination right before it
was you would have a coordinator that
coordinator would get the candidates
availability and get all the teams
availability and serve as this man in
the middle to like figure out like when
people could meet which was me early in
my career by the way. Then you had
kalanly now you have all sorts of tools
like um good time and others that are
doing this. This makes me feel like with
the advent of this,
&gt;&gt; almost everybody is on LinkedIn. You
know, call it like 97% of the people who
I would ever like even try and find are
on LinkedIn. And so would you agree now
that sourcing is going to become much
more of a bespoke thing like when you're
really looking for needles in the hay
stack of like these AI researchers that
Zuckerberg's paying $200 million for as
opposed to like now it feels like you're
going to enable recruiters
to spend more of their time on higher
leverage activities like relationship
building like truly understanding what a
candidate's motivators are like aligning
those motivators with the company or not
which is what good recruiters do.
&gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say it's uh hard to
predict the future. What I'm seeing and
hearing based upon my customer
conversations like one-on- ones with you
know leaders of tal acquisition, CHRO's
is that the way they're thinking about
it and like the way they're actually
making changes like literally real time
to their teams is that they are not at
this point and every company's
different, right? Some teams have
sorcerers, some teams don't, some teams
have people that do everything. But what
I'm hearing so far, and I would say this
is likely to be the case in the months
and quarters ahead, TBD years ahead
because everything's moving so fast is
exactly what you said as it relates to
being able to focus on higher value
activities. So I spoke to one of our
charter customers. They're doing
fantastic. It's one of the biggest
global construction and engineering
companies in the world and someone I've
had a relationship with a partnership
with for a number of years. And I gave
this person a call and said, "How are
things going?" And their take was that
we're seeing a completely different
level of performance and capabilities by
the recruiters that are using hiring
assistant on a regular basis.
Unsurprisingly, what's the hardest part
about customers using Ajentic Tech? It's
change management. Like without a doubt,
it's not just new tech, it's changing
workflows. But for the users that are
using this product like step change
effectiveness, finding talent they
weren't able to find previously,
improving recruiter productivity, so
hero improvements and doing a search to
sending an inmail. Like the metrics are
proving that there's a next level of
recruiter effectiveness. But ultimately
the reason that they were so excited is
to your point of being able to spend
more time with candidates. So they
recruit for very hard to fill positions
that are like make or break the company
but incredibly hard and every other
competitor is trying to recruit the same
people. So what they've done is they've
now freed up the recruiters that are
focusing on these candidates and so
they're like automating this intake and
sourcing and messaging part and they've
now freed up their time to actually
spend more time with candidates. And so
I think it goes back to like we're in
this place right now where even if your
job doesn't change like the skills
required to do your job effectively is
going to change. And so while some roles
may get smaller some may roles get
bigger I think every role is going to
change in a pretty fundamental way uh
first with generative and now with a
gentic tech
&gt;&gt; makes total sense to me. I mean the
analog for RC's I think is going to hold
here which is sorcerers aren't going to
go to go away entirely but like 90% of
that job should be done by you guys.
It's way better. You guys are way better
at this than we are. And this, you know,
kind of goes back to my point earlier on
purple squirrel searches.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; When hiring managers would come to us
and ask for these crazy requirements,
&gt;&gt; it was typically always like us being
like, "Guys, like this is not possible."
And then they'd be like, "Well, you guys
have a skill issue. Maybe you guys
aren't good enough at sourcing."
&gt;&gt; And actually, I think this is such a
better experience for all sides of the
table, which is great. Guess what? We
have a neutral arbiter. It turns out
it's LinkedIn. You may have heard of
them.
&gt;&gt; And they're going to source for us
&gt;&gt; because they're the best at this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like this is I think what everybody
wants. And I think ultimately we'll have
uh I really think it's about these
feedback cycles.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and these calibration cycles
because then you're going to put those
requirements in and be like, "Oh
nobody's or like no, you know, there's
five people and then the my my next
favorite part too is you guys have gone
to the messaging piece which is go send
a message, see if they get back to you."
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. Because it turns out if you're
looking for these five people,
&gt;&gt; there's probably a few other companies
that might be looking for those folks as
well and they get messaged all the time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it becomes a how do we
stand out sort of a thing because just
because you can find them doesn't mean
that they want to work at your company.
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; I was asking myself a question in my
head and trying to answer it. Maybe
Nolan both of you. Something that I'm
hearing a lot and we heard last week is
just the overwhelmingness of all these
tools coming out, all this new lovely
loveliness that's coming out. And it's
so much that it's actually now
paralyzing people and they're choosing
kind of not to use sometimes because of
it. What what fast forward 18 months, 24
months, like what what tools out there,
Nolan, Mark, does this replace? Like if
I'm listening to this and I've got six
other things or demos going on, how do I
think about my arsenal of AI tools or
platforms with this? As it relates to
partners and which tool to use and the
different part of the kind of tech stack
that a company deploys, I'd say there's
probably a couple things like everyone
should kind of think about before they
make a final call on like what partner
for what part of the kind of TA tech
stack and you can make a htm and then
kind of ATS and then on top of that like
pre-screening tools and then where your
actual sourcing tools if you have a CRM
etc. But I think that the main things
that I hear from customers on what
matters to them is show don't tell. And
so there's a lot of tools out there that
say it does what the this marketing
slide says and when they actually like
kick the tires on it, it doesn't do
anything remotely close to that or it's
actually not that accurate. So that's
like one, make sure you're going through
that vetting process. Part of that also
is it's really interesting time right
now with how tools are being built and
what access to data people have and
what's a responsible use, what's not a
responsible use, how is the data being
stored. And so what I hear from a lot of
customers that obviously want to ensure
that they're working with a partner that
is kind of trusted, handling their data
responsibly, that there's a set of
responsible AI principles and how they
build it is kind of another piece. Uh
but ultimately it's you know how can
this tool ideally fit within kind of
their workflow that exists today. And so
that's like one of the reasons we made a
very deliberate choice with the way we
built hiring assistant. So the way
hiring assistant works, it's actually
built into the flow of the work of a
recruiter today. So it actually works
alongside the recruiter product. And so
there's a lot of familiarity with the
concepts. And so you want to think about
like kind of the flow of work and then
does it integrate across the rest of
your tech stack. So it's definitely like
a checklist, but those are some of the
things that I hear most frequently from
customers.
&gt;&gt; Mark, who gets access to this? Is this
for the
&gt;&gt; like the big big recruiter seat or does
recruiter light get access to this? Does
sales get access?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so recruiter uh customers. So
customers that we work with with our
client-f facing teams will have access
to this at the end of September when it
will be globally available. So that's
when folks will be able to actually
access it. There's another kind of
question is can you access it? But then
it's are we ready to be able to use it?
And so we really helped our client
facing teams be able to work with
customers to help them understand like
where they are with their ability to use
this product effectively. So we've
learned so much during this charter
process. You know, one of the key
learnings through charter outside of
like change management will be real. And
of course, building a worldclass agentic
product that meets the quality
requirements of power recruiter users is
not a trivial task, especially when
you're doing it in a safe and trusted
way. But change management. And then the
last one with regards to like getting
people ready is are they going to be
ready to actually like use the product?
And so we worked so closely with
recruiter users to co-create this
almost. We don't want to create it in a
lab and like ship it out and be like,
"Oh, this isn't how people actually want
to use it." So, we've got to co-create
it with our users to make sure that we
have real product market fit and how
actual users want to use the product.
&gt;&gt; Makes sense. Um, last thing before we
let you go, Mark, uh, because you said
it and I saw both Kelly and I kind of
looked at each other on you, you'd
mentioned open to work.
And I've taken I think probably the most
heat of anybody on the internet for
being critical about the banner.
&gt;&gt; Um I know you guys have data that says
that open to work has been generally
helpful. Would you agree that there is
especially in tech
uh hiring manager and CEO bias that
exists for people who use the banner?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I I can understand that
perception. what I see and what uh when
I in the data and then when I speak to
actual users it's much more like not
clearly a bad thing. So we obviously
take lots of feedback we look at seekers
we look at the data and we have found it
to be kind of a net positive overall as
it relates to not just the job seeker
experience but actually with hiring. uh
there's a lot of incredibly quality
talented people in the world that are
looking for work and it's just an
important signal to be able to send it
out for recruiters to be able to find
those people.
&gt;&gt; To end on a maybe a humorous note here,
Nolan also I think went down a dark
rabbit hole asking for feedback from
chat GPT on his profile picture and the
background. Mark, I mean I don't know if
you have any reactions to this, but I
was a little shocked. I mean, you spent
what hours? an hour on this asking it
questions. I did not. No, I spent 10
minutes. This is like I think this is
the biggest miscon even I spent 10
minutes you looking at it for four
people who were curious about it. But
Mark, don't you think that that's
actually a good use of like given how
important your LinkedIn profile is if
it's replacing the resume? If we all
agree by the end of this call, right,
one of the things that humans look at is
the profile picture. Whether or not we
like that is a separate thing. And so
using chat GBT to give you feedback on
your profile picture is something I did
recently. What's your take on that?
&gt;&gt; I've never done it myself. I wouldn't
say I have a informed take on it outside
of I probably speak with chat GBT as
well as co-pilot maybe a dozen times a
day. So it makes sense you would ask for
some feedback.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I had to slip it in there just to seeing
reaction. So Nolan asking about
feedback. I I had a good time with that
with him. But in a serious note actually
a lot of people don't have a picture up
&gt;&gt; for good reason and I understand that.
Do you have any reaction to that
decision?
&gt;&gt; Um well I mean everyone makes the choice
based upon whatever they want to do. We
do see uh improved connections in male
sense when there is a profile but you
know I understand some folks don't want
to put their profile their picture in
their profile. One of the things that we
take incredibly seriously, we always
have just given if you think about
LinkedIn, you know, it's all about do
members trust us? And so something we've
always taken very seriously is do
members trust LinkedIn with their data.
Do they trust us with their profile? We
always want to make what's available
consistent clarity. You want to give
them control. And so when you think
about that, how do you build upon it?
thinking about bias is I assume you're
kind of thinking about with the profile
picture is something that we've taken
very seriously for probably 15 years now
and you know building AI and generative
AI and aentic AI you know this is one of
the great parts about being part of
Microsoft there's many others but we're
very aligned with generally responsible
AI principles so lots of time effort
care is put into kind of detecting any
bias in our systems
&gt;&gt; yep which makes sense Mark where Can
people find you?
&gt;&gt; Uh, you can find me on LinkedIn. It's
probably the best place in a
professional context. So, I would go
there. So, Mark Labosco.
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Mark, thank you so much for the
time, man.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mark.
&gt;&gt; See y'all.
