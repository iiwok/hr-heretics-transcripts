time these are all extremely talented
 
time these are all extremely talented
people they had great intentions but
 
people they had great intentions but
they were giving him advice that I think
 
they were giving him advice that I think
was probably I would characterize I
 
was probably I would characterize I
don't know if Brian would ever
 
don't know if Brian would ever
characterize it this way it's sort of
 
characterize it this way it's sort of
like mainstream this is how you build a
 
like mainstream this is how you build a
tech company advice this is how you're

marketplace in the talent Marketplace
 
marketplace in the talent Marketplace
Brian and I think the results of that
 
Brian and I think the results of that
was that for several years you know the
 
was that for several years you know the
company drifted like a few degrees off
 
company drifted like a few degrees off
of like the compass that Brian had it
 
of like the compass that Brian had it
wasn't really overt it wasn't like oh my
 
wasn't really overt it wasn't like oh my
God we're wildly off Direction but if
 
God we're wildly off Direction but if
you're you know two to five degrees off
 
you're you know two to five degrees off
for three or four years in a row and you
 
for three or four years in a row and you
grow from 200 to 700 people pretty soon
 
grow from 200 to 700 people pretty soon
you look back and you're like wait a
 
you look back and you're like wait a
minute we're there's a substantial
 
minute we're there's a substantial
difference here between the way you know
 
difference here between the way you know
I would like to operate this company and
 
I would like to operate this company and
the way it's actually
 
the way it's actually
operating and so part of the way that
 
operating and so part of the way that
played out even before sort of that
 
played out even before sort of that
September time frame was you know as we
 
September time frame was you know as we
were having sort of the classic all
 
were having sort of the classic all
hands that a company in the tech sector
 
hands that a company in the tech sector
might have there was these grandstanding
 
might have there was these grandstanding
moments where people were coming up on
 
moments where people were coming up on
the in the mic and trying to you know
 
the in the mic and trying to you know
get gotcha moments where they were
 
get gotcha moments where they were
giving me some tough question or Brian
 
giving me some tough question or Brian
some tough question things like that and
 
some tough question things like that and
I think that that sort of you know
 
I think that that sort of you know
didn't sit well with Brian and the
 
didn't sit well with Brian and the
reason it didn't sit well with Brian and
 
reason it didn't sit well with Brian and
this is one I think one of the beauties
 
this is one I think one of the beauties
of working with founder owners is like
 
of working with founder owners is like
Brian is on a mission to fundamentally
 
Brian is on a mission to fundamentally
change the way the world operates to
 
change the way the world operates to
drive economic freedom right the the the
 
drive economic freedom right the the the
when you think about sort of the mission
 
when you think about sort of the mission
we have as a company it's a life's work
 
we have as a company it's a life's work
it can almost seem insurmountable at
 
it can almost seem insurmountable at
times and I think what he found is like
 
times and I think what he found is like
how do people have time to try to divide
 
how do people have time to try to divide
us and focus on these things that aren't
 
us and focus on these things that aren't
about our mission and these were even
 
about our mission and these were even
just smaller little sort of gotcha
 
just smaller little sort of gotcha
moments let alone sort of you know
 
moments let alone sort of you know
larger moments that we were facing as a
 
larger moments that we were facing as a
society so when you fast forward all the
 
society so when you fast forward all the
way to you know the the terrible
 
way to you know the the terrible
incident with George Floyd and
 
incident with George Floyd and
everything that was going on around
 
everything that was going on around
social justice movement what I think we
 
social justice movement what I think we
saw was that then there was an
 
saw was that then there was an
expectation for a lot of companies in
 
expectation for a lot of companies in
the marketplace at least a tcid
 
the marketplace at least a tcid
expectation that companies were going to
 
expectation that companies were going to
focus on things outside of their mission
 
focus on things outside of their mission
and I think that's where the moment hit
 
and I think that's where the moment hit
for
 
for
Brian where he was just clear as can be
 
Brian where he was just clear as can be
that look the only thing that everybody
 
that look the only thing that everybody
at coin base can be assured of that we
 
at coin base can be assured of that we
share as a common framework is our
 
share as a common framework is our
pursuit of the company's Mission and we
 
pursuit of the company's Mission and we
don't have time or the luxury of sort of
 
don't have time or the luxury of sort of
focusing on things outside that if we're
 
focusing on things outside that if we're
going to take on this truly massive task
 
going to take on this truly massive task
that we're trying to tackle and so I
 
that we're trying to tackle and so I
think in that moment you know for Brian
 
think in that moment you know for Brian
this was not just about sort of being a
 
this was not just about sort of being a
political and to be clear sometimes this
 
political and to be clear sometimes this
gets lost when we focus on it what we're
 
gets lost when we focus on it what we're
saying is we're not going to be
 
saying is we're not going to be
political and focus on politics around
 
political and focus on politics around
things outside of our mission things we
 
things outside of our mission things we
can't impact we clearly do take stances
 
can't impact we clearly do take stances
on things that can impact crypto today
 
on things that can impact crypto today
and maybe we'll talk about that later
 
and maybe we'll talk about that later
but but I think for Brian this was a
 
but but I think for Brian this was a
moment sort of rehap shape the
 
moment sort of rehap shape the
organization and say hey the company I
 
organization and say hey the company I
want to build is going to be comprised
 
want to build is going to be comprised
of people who are bound by a Relentless
 
of people who are bound by a Relentless
focus on achieving our mission and we're
 
focus on achieving our mission and we're
not going to focus on what divides us or
 
not going to focus on what divides us or
gots you moments we're going to focus on
 
gots you moments we're going to focus on
this sort of core area of driving
 
this sort of core area of driving
economic freedom and so that's sort of
 
economic freedom and so that's sort of
the underpinning of how we got to that
 
the underpinning of how we got to that
moment of the blog around being Mission
 
moment of the blog around being Mission

first and how we took that stance I want
to talk about post the decision and what

we're going to give you a generous
 
we're going to give you a generous
Severance but if you can do it we're
 
Severance but if you can do it we're
really excited to have you and that I
 
really excited to have you and that I
think was a seminal moment for us
 
think was a seminal moment for us
because I think being able to take that
 
because I think being able to take that
stance and having that sort of
 
stance and having that sort of
conviction then helped us Nolan really
 
conviction then helped us Nolan really
get more comfortable with the idea that
 
get more comfortable with the idea that
we will fight through some of these
 
we will fight through some of these
other headwinds that you were talking
 
other headwinds that you were talking
about and so what did ultimately play
 
about and so what did ultimately play
out is a couple of things that we saw
 
out is a couple of things that we saw
and to be very candid to my surprise
 
and to be very candid to my surprise
because I wasn't sure how this was all
 
because I wasn't sure how this was all
going to break either we found that
 
going to break either we found that
there was a tremendous amount of people
 
there was a tremendous amount of people
who actually flocked to an environment
 
who actually flocked to an environment
where they were going to be free from
 
where they were going to be free from
the burden of like division in the
 
the burden of like division in the
workplace that they wanted to come to a
 
workplace that they wanted to come to a
place that had a why that was going to
 
place that had a why that was going to
be focused on the mission we found that
 
be focused on the mission we found that
it did not in any way we look to be very
 
it did not in any way we look to be very
clear we didn't say hey we're not going
 
clear we didn't say hey we're not going
to focus on on things we said we're
 
to focus on on things we said we're
going to focus on things we can control
 
going to focus on things we can control
we may want to talk about this later
 
we may want to talk about this later
we've taken a lot of steps I think that
 
we've taken a lot of steps I think that
we're very proud of that create a more
 
we're very proud of that create a more
Equitable and diverse environment inside
 
Equitable and diverse environment inside
the company and we found people that
 
the company and we found people that
really appreciated that and so the
 
really appreciated that and so the
shorter answer is all the doomsday that
 
shorter answer is all the doomsday that
we thought was coming didn't happen we
 
we thought was coming didn't happen we
actually flourished after that and then
 
actually flourished after that and then
I would say you know the epilog for me
 
I would say you know the epilog for me
personally is I could create a side
 
personally is I could create a side
business on Consulting with CEOs chro
 
business on Consulting with CEOs chro
who call me still today and say hey we
 
who call me still today and say hey we
would like to do something like this but
 
would like to do something like this but
we're petrified how did you do it and I
 
we're petrified how did you do it and I
would say that what we've probably all
 
would say that what we've probably all
seen is that in this world where as the
 
seen is that in this world where as the
economy has sort of been a little
 
economy has sort of been a little
jittery and as companies have been
 
jittery and as companies have been
facing like how do they handle and
 
facing like how do they handle and
navigate this a little bit more dicey
 
navigate this a little bit more dicey
environment we've seen some companies
 
environment we've seen some companies
sort of retrench from the stances that
 
sort of retrench from the stances that
they've taken and yet we've stayed as
 
they've taken and yet we've stayed as
steadfast as we always were so my short
 
steadfast as we always were so my short
answer is there and this is one of the
 
answer is there and this is one of the
things I've just found in working for
 
things I've just found in working for
you know Brian and generally for founder
 
you know Brian and generally for founder
owners
 
owners

vision and so all kudos to him I think
he saw a vision that I didn't see but I
 
he saw a vision that I didn't see but I
was willing to stand behind and execute

question Kelly I think a couple of
 
question Kelly I think a couple of
things I think one of the things and I
 
things I think one of the things and I
don't mean this flippantly I I think one
 
don't mean this flippantly I I think one
of the things you want to do when you
 
of the things you want to do when you
work for a founder leader at least and I
 
work for a founder leader at least and I

tips and I say to them like you know you
want to get to your near-death moment
 
want to get to your near-death moment
with them as fast as possible don't be
 
with them as fast as possible don't be
afraid of that like run head first in
 
afraid of that like run head first in
your near-death moment where you two are
 
your near-death moment where you two are
going to go head to head and you're
 
going to go head to head and you're
going to figure out are we going to work
 
going to figure out are we going to work
together or are we not and if you can
 
together or are we not and if you can
have that kind of moment really quickly
 
have that kind of moment really quickly

think it's better to go through that and
 
think it's better to go through that and
then find another one that you can work
 
then find another one that you can work
at and there's a good chance you'll get
 
at and there's a good chance you'll get
through the other side and when you get
 
through the other side and when you get
through the other side the trust and the
 
through the other side the trust and the
connection that you have helps you see
 
connection that you have helps you see
through like o this fear that people are
 
through like o this fear that people are
painting at you so I would say I was
 
painting at you so I would say I was
fortunate that Brian and I had already
 
fortunate that Brian and I had already
had our near-death moment together as
 
had our near-death moment together as
chro and CEO and so by the time we got
 
chro and CEO and so by the time we got
to that kind of tense moment I just had
 
to that kind of tense moment I just had
faith in our relationship I had faith
 
faith in our relationship I had faith
that he had my back I had I wanted to
 
that he had my back I had I wanted to
have his back and I say the other thing

programs and you know so this is one
where we went back and forth and had a
 
where we went back and forth and had a
lot of iterations as a as a small group
 
lot of iterations as a as a small group
on designing and then but I think
 
on designing and then but I think
agreeing with you we see this as
 
agreeing with you we see this as
something that's going to shape the next
 
something that's going to shape the next
you know five years or more of coinbase
 
you know five years or more of coinbase
and I you know it's something that's
 
and I you know it's something that's
really going to be Central to the way we
 
really going to be Central to the way we
build the company and i' say one of the
 
build the company and i' say one of the
things by the way just to say is like
 
things by the way just to say is like
look we other thing I would say to
 
look we other thing I would say to
people to think about is you know my
 
people to think about is you know my
journey at coinbase is I joined we were
 
journey at coinbase is I joined we were
 
today we sit at 3,500 people one of the
 
today we sit at 3,500 people one of the
things we took away from that moment is
 
things we took away from that moment is
even with the best of intentions were we
 
even with the best of intentions were we
as did we hold ourselves to the highest
 
as did we hold ourselves to the highest
standards possible on the talent bar and
 
standards possible on the talent bar and
our answer was probably no that's not to
 
our answer was probably no that's not to
say that we didn't everybody who joined
 
say that we didn't everybody who joined
everybody who's been here we thought was
 
everybody who's been here we thought was
amazing has great talent but were we
 
amazing has great talent but were we
holding the standard as high as we
 
holding the standard as high as we
wanted to in the moments of runup no I
 
wanted to in the moments of runup no I
think we would honestly say we probably
 
think we would honestly say we probably
started removing too much friction from
 
started removing too much friction from
our processes in the name of scale and
 
our processes in the name of scale and
we want to take a stance right here and
 
we want to take a stance right here and
right now and say we'll never do that
 
right now and say we'll never do that
again we're going to prioritize the
 
again we're going to prioritize the
quality of our talent over anything at
 
quality of our talent over anything at
this point that's so good the I want to
 
this point that's so good the I want to
get into so I I agree with a lot of the
 
get into so I I agree with a lot of the
talent density article I think for me
 
talent density article I think for me
like the percentage of hires from
 
like the percentage of hires from

to move things slower and it turns out
 
to move things slower and it turns out
that you know we did this at door Dash
 
that you know we did this at door Dash
through 4,000 employees and Tony was
 
through 4,000 employees and Tony was
Tony was the only person who did it and
 
Tony was the only person who did it and
was able to turn stuff around within 24
 
was able to turn stuff around within 24
hours like that's never going to cause a
 
hours like that's never going to cause a
problem the one I think a lot about is
 
problem the one I think a lot about is
real-time feedback and I think it's I
 
real-time feedback and I think it's I
think it's aspirational I think it's
 
think it's aspirational I think it's
what we should be doing I have yet yet
 
what we should be doing I have yet yet
to see it done in a way that is actually
 
to see it done in a way that is actually
giving people consistent feedback and
 
giving people consistent feedback and
then also like you know real time is
 
then also like you know real time is
great but it's also helpful to take a
 
great but it's also helpful to take a
step back and get a little bit more of a
 
step back and get a little bit more of a
macro level view so how are how are you
 
macro level view so how are how are you
guys doing real time feedback yeah so
 
guys doing real time feedback yeah so
just real quick before I answer that I
 
just real quick before I answer that I
will say I share with you uh in our
 
will say I share with you uh in our
offer approval Brian and Emily either

one of the things that we did is we
actually put the hiring manager and the
 
actually put the hiring manager and the
recruiter on the thread for offer
 
recruiter on the thread for offer
approval and because we did that they
 
approval and because we did that they
were able like they got to see exactly
 
were able like they got to see exactly
how Tony was responding and the
 
how Tony was responding and the
questions that he had and they were in
 
questions that he had and they were in
charge of responding to those questions

see how it's going to pay out because
people are like literally our bar has
 
people are like literally our bar has
gone up overnight I mean you know like y
 
gone up overnight I mean you know like y
i I will say we had a scenario where the
 
i I will say we had a scenario where the
very first candidate that we submitted
 
very first candidate that we submitted
in this was rejected I think that
 
in this was rejected I think that
candidate would have been hired the week
 
candidate would have been hired the week
before the process went live that's us
 
before the process went live that's us
tangibly raising the hiring bar and I
 
tangibly raising the hiring bar and I
think they were rejected for the right

employee and you're really delivering a
lot of value yeah it's so funny it's

like these employees have the same trap
 
like these employees have the same trap
they fall into the same trap that a lot
 
they fall into the same trap that a lot
of us fall into is the same old ways of
 
of us fall into is the same old ways of
doing things and it's just ingrained and

change management versus the blog post
 
change management versus the blog post
what I'm learning though Kelly from this
 
what I'm learning though Kelly from this
conversation with LJ is that when you
 
conversation with LJ is that when you
talk about the
 
talk about the
intent and the problem that you're
 
intent and the problem that you're
trying to solve so like for example like
 
trying to solve so like for example like
manager bias in performance is one of
 
manager bias in performance is one of
the biggest problems that we've all
 
the biggest problems that we've all
faced because they're typically closest
 
faced because they're typically closest
to the work they have 80% of the packet
 
to the work they have 80% of the packet
that's put together for promotion and
 
that's put together for promotion and
that's the thing that we're looking at
 
that's the thing that we're looking at
well what if your manager just doesn't
 
well what if your manager just doesn't
like you or you guys don't get along or
 
like you or you guys don't get along or
there's some sort of weird fit with the
 
there's some sort of weird fit with the
manager and they have all of the power
 
manager and they have all of the power
to stop your career and LJ it's so
 
to stop your career and LJ it's so
interesting the way that you frame it
 
interesting the way that you frame it
because you know when you frame it as
 
because you know when you frame it as
hey we're trying to get more data points
 
hey we're trying to get more data points
to ensure that we're eliminating the
 
to ensure that we're eliminating the
manager bias from holding you back that
 
manager bias from holding you back that
completely reframes it in my head and
 
completely reframes it in my head and
I'm hoping that it does for the company
 
I'm hoping that it does for the company
as well yeah I think if we build it the
 
as well yeah I think if we build it the
right way and we connect these dots for
 
right way and we connect these dots for
people it will but I think Kelly's
 
people it will but I think Kelly's
Point's well taken like it's one thing
 
Point's well taken like it's one thing
Sharon Brian's intent it's another thing
 
Sharon Brian's intent it's another thing
like unwinding you know I got 25 years
 
like unwinding you know I got 25 years
of work experience telling me this kind
 
of work experience telling me this kind
of thing you know yeah it's the same
 
of thing you know yeah it's the same
like formula that you all use around why
 
like formula that you all use around why
you do things it's explaining the why to
 
you do things it's explaining the why to
everyone else from a principl approach
 
everyone else from a principl approach
and bringing them along with and like
 
and bringing them along with and like
ironically that stops the town hall kind
 
ironically that stops the town hall kind
of anonymous like dings you know because
 
of anonymous like dings you know because
now they understand the why and all
 
now they understand the why and all
these things so they all go together in
 
these things so they all go together in
this beautiful system when it's working
 
this beautiful system when it's working
correctly so so LJ Kelly and I have been
 
correctly so so LJ Kelly and I have been
talking a lot about work
 
talking a lot about work
trials and this has been coming up you
 
trials and this has been coming up you
know most famously at base camp also at
 
know most famously at base camp also at
linear there's more and more especially
 
linear there's more and more especially
early stage smaller companies that are
 
early stage smaller companies that are
doing work trials the one piece about
 
doing work trials the one piece about
the talent density article that for me
 
the talent density article that for me
felt like it was missing because you
 
felt like it was missing because you
basically what you guys are trying to do
 
basically what you guys are trying to do
is increase signal like how good is the
 
is increase signal like how good is the
person like and and what do we know
 
person like and and what do we know
about them and then to hire like the
 
about them and then to hire like the
best person for
 
best person for
coinbase the the thing that's missing
 
coinbase the the thing that's missing
for me is like well why aren't you
 
for me is like well why aren't you
actually like getting to work with these
 
actually like getting to work with these
people so did you guys talk about work
 
people so did you guys talk about work
trials and is that something that you
 
trials and is that something that you
guys are exploring yeah there's two
 
guys are exploring yeah there's two
aspects of that one I would say we
 
aspects of that one I would say we
actually have at the end of our
 
actually have at the end of our
interview process for almost all of our
 
interview process for almost all of our
roles we actually have a a a work trial
 
roles we actually have a a a work trial
we call it and it's it's a really small
 
we call it and it's it's a really small
you know I don't want to it doesn't rise
 
you know I don't want to it doesn't rise
to some of what you've you've
 
to some of what you've you've
highlighted but we give people a prompt
 
highlighted but we give people a prompt
we ask them to lay out like a a really
 
we ask them to lay out like a a really
basic sort of presentation on that
 
basic sort of presentation on that
prompt and then they spend 30 minutes
 
prompt and then they spend 30 minutes
presenting it to us and or 20 minutes
 
presenting it to us and or 20 minutes
presenting to us and 10 minutes feeding
 
presenting to us and 10 minutes feeding
you know Fielding questions and
 
you know Fielding questions and
answering those it's not all the way to
 
answering those it's not all the way to
A Day in the Life or really running a
 
A Day in the Life or really running a
whole project but I will say even that
 
whole project but I will say even that
 
like is someone going to be right for
 
like is someone going to be right for
our company are they going to think on
 
our company are they going to think on
their feet can they communicate in a way
 
their feet can they communicate in a way
that's going to command the attention
 
that's going to command the attention
and respect of our leaders and so that
 
and respect of our leaders and so that
little window really does help and then
 
little window really does help and then
I would say secondarily Nolan my whole
 
I would say secondarily Nolan my whole
thing on the emerging Talent or early
 
thing on the emerging Talent or early
and career Talent is really two things
 
and career Talent is really two things
one um I think the the the primary
 
one um I think the the the primary
adopters of crypto are earlier in career
 
adopters of crypto are earlier in career
and we need more of those people in here
 
and we need more of those people in here
building products for them and then two
 
building products for them and then two
I think it's the best work trial there
 
I think it's the best work trial there
is in the world I get interns to come
 
is in the world I get interns to come
work with us for 12 weeks and it's
 
work with us for 12 weeks and it's
bidirectional I mean again it's not
 
bidirectional I mean again it's not
one-sided I want to be as transparent as
 
one-sided I want to be as transparent as
possible I keep pushing team like I want
 
possible I keep pushing team like I want
these interns to leave here knowing
 
these interns to leave here knowing
unbelievably firmly what it's like to
 
unbelievably firmly what it's like to
work at coinbase so they can
 
work at coinbase so they can
intentionally opt in or not and I want
 
intentionally opt in or not and I want
us to have I want to instrument every
 
us to have I want to instrument every
moment of their time with us so that we
 
moment of their time with us so that we
get all sorts of signal on whether
 
get all sorts of signal on whether
they're going to be successful here or
 
they're going to be successful here or
not and at the end of that 12 weeks I
 
not and at the end of that 12 weeks I
think where the signal matches where our
 
think where the signal matches where our
signal says this person's going to be
 
signal says this person's going to be
successful and where their signal says
 
successful and where their signal says
this is the kind of place I work that
 
this is the kind of place I work that
birir I want to work that bir
 
birir I want to work that bir
directional work trial that's going to
 
directional work trial that's going to
be the very best outcomes we could get
 
be the very best outcomes we could get
now the problem you know I'd love to do
 
now the problem you know I'd love to do
that across the board the problem is
 
that across the board the problem is
you're probably not going to get me to
 
you're probably not going to get me to
resign from coinbase and come do a
 
resign from coinbase and come do a
 
company that kind of thing so it's
 
company that kind of thing so it's
really hard to do in the professional
 
really hard to do in the professional
workplace but that's why I'd like to see
 
workplace but that's why I'd like to see
you know in this emerging Talent just
 
you know in this emerging Talent just
become a much much bigger segment of our
 
become a much much bigger segment of our
population so true you had also
 
population so true you had also
mentioned
 
mentioned
earlier that uh post the mission first
 
earlier that uh post the mission first
article I I think the quote you had was
 
article I I think the quote you had was
you are you trying to be more Equitable
 
you are you trying to be more Equitable
and you are now more
 
and you are now more
diverse I'm assuming that how you're
 
diverse I'm assuming that how you're
doing that is actually by going a little
 
doing that is actually by going a little
bit more Junior as the talent pool then
 
bit more Junior as the talent pool then
opens up but talk us through like
 
opens up but talk us through like
exactly what that means and how you were
 
exactly what that means and how you were
able to achieve that yeah I would say
 
able to achieve that yeah I would say
the one so just zooming back one of the
 
the one so just zooming back one of the
things we always said is look we're
 
things we always said is look we're
going to focus on things we can impact
 
going to focus on things we can impact
we're not going to make make statements
 
we're not going to make make statements
that are virtue signals or things that
 
that are virtue signals or things that
are outlandish and that we'll never
 
are outlandish and that we'll never
achieve you know we're not going to tell
 
achieve you know we're not going to tell
you that you know 50% of our software
 
you that you know 50% of our software
Engineers that we hire are going to be
 
Engineers that we hire are going to be
women if only 25% of the graduating
 
women if only 25% of the graduating
computer science majors are women like
 
computer science majors are women like
we're going to try to make very
 
we're going to try to make very
realistic goals in our organization and
 
realistic goals in our organization and
we're going to try to focus on programs
 
we're going to try to focus on programs
that really have a massive impact and
 
that really have a massive impact and
one of the things that I think was the
 
one of the things that I think was the
biggest impact we've had is way back we
 
biggest impact we've had is way back we
um we moved to a single pay Target and
 
um we moved to a single pay Target and
we said without exception I can sit here
 
we said without exception I can sit here
and tell you we have never since
 
and tell you we have never since
implementing this made one exception we
 
implementing this made one exception we
said hey one of the ways that we can
 
said hey one of the ways that we can
impact diversity one of the ways we can
 
impact diversity one of the ways we can
remove sort of some of the bad things
 
remove sort of some of the bad things
that potentially happen in the world is
 
that potentially happen in the world is
by not saying hey we're going to
 
by not saying hey we're going to
perpetuate any compensation differences
 
perpetuate any compensation differences
that you know women or minorities or
 
that you know women or minorities or
things experienc coming out of school
 
things experienc coming out of school
and through their career and continue to
 
and through their career and continue to
perpetuate that we're going to say when
 
perpetuate that we're going to say when
you come to coinbase there is one number
 
you come to coinbase there is one number
we pay anybody who joins and that's the
 
we pay anybody who joins and that's the
same number that everybody gets once
 
same number that everybody gets once
they're here in that same level and then
 
they're here in that same level and then
what we're going to differentiate your
 
what we're going to differentiate your
compensation on is how do you how do you
 
compensation on is how do you how do you
perform at coinbase and and then we
 
perform at coinbase and and then we
focus and remove bias from that process
 
focus and remove bias from that process
and we back test it we make sure there's
 
and we back test it we make sure there's
no dispar impact and so what we've seen
 
no dispar impact and so what we've seen
is we have a world where I think that
 
is we have a world where I think that
has been the biggest differentiator I
 
has been the biggest differentiator I
you know one of the things I talk to
 
you know one of the things I talk to
people about or what I hear from our
 
people about or what I hear from our
employees is you know I was worried
 
employees is you know I was worried
about Mission first I saw that but when
 
about Mission first I saw that but when
I heard that hey you're making pay this
 
I heard that hey you're making pay this
fair for us I wanted to work at that
 
fair for us I wanted to work at that
company and so yes no and some of it's
 
company and so yes no and some of it's
been we've hired earlier in career
 
been we've hired earlier in career
people some of it's been that we've gone
 
people some of it's been that we've gone
remote to be honest with you right I
 
remote to be honest with you right I
mean just to be really candid I don't
 
mean just to be really candid I don't
think the population that can afford to
 
think the population that can afford to
commute to downtown San Francisco is the
 
commute to downtown San Francisco is the
most diverse population in the world so
 
most diverse population in the world so
it turns out when we can hire around all
 
it turns out when we can hire around all
of North America and all the world
 
of North America and all the world
diversity suddenly gets a lot better so
 
diversity suddenly gets a lot better so
um look we have a long way to go as a z
 
um look we have a long way to go as a z
company on this but I think when you
 
company on this but I think when you
think about smart programs that you can
 
think about smart programs that you can
control versus things that just you know
 
control versus things that just you know
Garner some headlines but don't really
 
Garner some headlines but don't really
move the needle that's another one of
 
move the needle that's another one of
those things that we've seen really play
 
those things that we've seen really play
out really well for us yeah I want to
 
out really well for us yeah I want to
make sure we don't lose this you said
 
make sure we don't lose this you said
you haven't made one exception to the
 
you haven't made one exception to the
single pay Target that is incredible I
 
single pay Target that is incredible I
mean there has to be a story where you
 
mean there has to be a story where you
attempt to make that exception I mean
 
attempt to make that exception I mean
how how do you hold that line yeah I've
 
how how do you hold that line yeah I've
tried that in the past and it hasn't
 
tried that in the past and it hasn't
worked because it's so hard to hold the
 
worked because it's so hard to hold the
line because you get so much pressure
 
line because you get so much pressure
from managers who already have time bias
 
from managers who already have time bias
who need to make hires and get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done
 
who need to make hires and get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done
and so how that's a great question Kelly
 
and so how that's a great question Kelly
how do you do that
 
how do you do that
LJ so I think this goes to a lot of the
 
LJ so I think this goes to a lot of the
things we talked about I think one it's
 
things we talked about I think one it's
like get to that near-death experience I
 
like get to that near-death experience I
think two it's about who's the
 
think two it's about who's the
drri uh so one I knew Brian and Emily
 
drri uh so one I knew Brian and Emily
when we implemented this and the
 
when we implemented this and the
executive team had my back because we
 
executive team had my back because we
decided we're going to do it so when we
 
decided we're going to do it so when we
decide to do something as an executive
 
decide to do something as an executive
team we don't decide to do it except
 
team we don't decide to do it except
when it doesn't work for us we decide to
 
when it doesn't work for us we decide to
do it when it's inconvenient yeah I was
 
do it when it's inconvenient yeah I was
the drri or you know maybe Emily was a
 
the drri or you know maybe Emily was a
br D but and any event we decided as an
 
br D but and any event we decided as an
exact um team that you know this was a
 
exact um team that you know this was a
decision I think
 
decision I think
um and I think by the way we are just
 
um and I think by the way we are just
inherently
 
inherently
convicted that we should shouldn't be
 
convicted that we should shouldn't be
paying people for what they delivered at
 
paying people for what they delivered at
their last employer we should be paying
 
their last employer we should be paying
them for the impact they had here so the
 
them for the impact they had here so the
other thing we did there is we move to
 
other thing we did there is we move to
this you know really enhanced pay for
 
this you know really enhanced pay for
performance model where our top
 
performance model where our top
performing people get one and a half and
 
performing people get one and a half and
 
extraordinarily differential damn and
 
extraordinarily differential damn and
Brian and Emily and the company and the
 
Brian and Emily and the company and the
board everybody really believes in

differentiated outcome so you know you
 
differentiated outcome so you know you
got to take the for the lack of a better
 
got to take the for the lack of a better
phrase the good with the bad if you want

you guys think about it you guys also
eliminated the fouryear stock Grant in
 
eliminated the fouryear stock Grant in
favor of the one-year
 
favor of the one-year
Grant and I've talked to a lot of of
 
Grant and I've talked to a lot of of
people in comp and what I hear from
 
people in comp and what I hear from
people in comp say is like well that's
 
people in comp say is like well that's
good for the company because they don't
 
good for the company because they don't
have as many shares
 
have as many shares
outstanding and it's good for the
 
outstanding and it's good for the
employee if the stock price goes down
 
employee if the stock price goes down
but it's not great for the employee if
 
but it's not great for the employee if
the stock price goes up how do you guys
 
the stock price goes up how do you guys
think about that and what was the
 
think about that and what was the
Genesis around that
 
Genesis around that
decision actually something totally
 
decision actually something totally
different for us it's a little bit of
 
different for us it's a little bit of
what goes back to the chaos that that
 
what goes back to the chaos that that
that Kelly was talking about so look
 
that Kelly was talking about so look
incredible volatility crypto right I
 
incredible volatility crypto right I
mean think about it uh you know we were
 
mean think about it uh you know we were
valued at 8 billion in the December
 
valued at 8 billion in the December
before we went public in April and we
 
before we went public in April and we
went public for I don't know 90 95
 
went public for I don't know 90 95
billion so in that five month run up
 
billion so in that five month run up
right it's just crazy um and then so you
 
right it's just crazy um and then so you
know we've seen our stock go from up to
 
know we've seen our stock go from up to
 
were thinking about look yes we want to
 
were thinking about look yes we want to
preserve our burn we want to get the
 
preserve our burn we want to get the
greatest return on our Equity Poss we're
 
greatest return on our Equity Poss we're
a for-profit business we got to return
 
a for-profit business we got to return
shareholder value we got to manage these
 
shareholder value we got to manage these
things I I don't want to deny any of
 
things I I don't want to deny any of
that but what we were also thinking
 
that but what we were also thinking
about is like hey we want to insulate
 
about is like hey we want to insulate
our people a little bit from that
 
our people a little bit from that
volatility right so in a world where I
 
volatility right so in a world where I
could give you a fouryear grant at 350
 
could give you a fouryear grant at 350
and then you might spend the next two
 
and then you might spend the next two
and a half years with the stock at
 
and a half years with the stock at
 
talk about stress and Chaos that's going
 
talk about stress and Chaos that's going
to talk unbelievable stress and Chaos in
 
to talk unbelievable stress and Chaos in
the system
 
the system
so what we found is by moving to this
 
so what we found is by moving to this
model of annual grants and then that yes
 
model of annual grants and then that yes
helps us on our on our on the burn rate
 
helps us on our on our on the burn rate
but then we take that savings and we're
 
but then we take that savings and we're
redeploying it into other programs for
 
redeploying it into other programs for
some multi-year grants we're still
 
some multi-year grants we're still
working through some of this right now
 
working through some of this right now
we did it a little bit before the market
 
we did it a little bit before the market
went down we're revisiting it now we
 
went down we're revisiting it now we
have other multi-year programs to reward
 
have other multi-year programs to reward
people as well so we're finding a mix
 
people as well so we're finding a mix
but on a regular basis we're saying hey
 
but on a regular basis we're saying hey
we want to provide you ownership we want
 
we want to provide you ownership we want
you to own stock but we don't want you
 
you to own stock but we don't want you
to necessarily have to ride the wave of
 
to necessarily have to ride the wave of
the public markets and how they're
 
the public markets and how they're
valuing a crypto company we want to give
 
valuing a crypto company we want to give
you the chance to sort of get pricing
 
you the chance to sort of get pricing
that's closer to the market at the time
 
that's closer to the market at the time
you get your Grant and I think in
 
you get your Grant and I think in
general that's look some people love it
 
general that's look some people love it
I think most people have enjoyed it some
 
I think most people have enjoyed it some
don't but in general I think it's been a
 
don't but in general I think it's been a
huge net win for us and I would say it's
 
huge net win for us and I would say it's
another one of those examples Brian came
 
another one of those examples Brian came
up with this one when he had heard about
 
up with this one when he had heard about
it and I was like you know all my
 
it and I was like you know all my
instinct was like three four year grants
 
instinct was like three four year grants
are the way the industry works but at
 
are the way the industry works but at
this point I'd already been like Brian's
 
this point I'd already been like Brian's
right I'm gonna figure out why he's
 
right I'm gonna figure out why he's
right and go make it happen and I think
 
right and go make it happen and I think
generally more people have moved in this
 
generally more people have moved in this
direction over time than I would have
 
direction over time than I would have
anticipated yeah it's cuz like stripe
 
anticipated yeah it's cuz like stripe
did it lift did it and this is all they
 
did it lift did it and this is all they
did it before the market cratered and my
 
did it before the market cratered and my
take at the time was like this is not
 
take at the time was like this is not
employee friendly and it turned out I
 
employee friendly and it turned out I
was wrong because because markets go up
 
was wrong because because markets go up
markets go down and if the market goes
 
markets go down and if the market goes
down you actually have a much bigger
 
down you actually have a much bigger
problem around how you're going to reset
 
problem around how you're going to reset
all of those people and and a lot of
 
all of those people and and a lot of
companies are having to do that
 
companies are having to do that
especially late stage private companies
 
especially late stage private companies
whose valuations haven't been reset yet
 
whose valuations haven't been reset yet
and that's really really bad for
 
and that's really really bad for
employees so I I've been learning
