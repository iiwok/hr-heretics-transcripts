all right hey everybody welcome back to
another segment of dear Heretics our
favorite advice column Nolan um these
were really good so first of all thank
you all for setting these in they are
unedited pretty much they're really
difficult situations and we really
appreciate them so again please keep
these coming to us we look forward to
them every week we do have a backlog
we're going to start here Nolan kind of
two parts to this question related and
here we go dear Heretics I ran into a
bit of a sensitive situation we are in
Rapid growth mode which is amazing our
current CFO has a longstanding
relationship with our CEO and a voting
interest in the company it's become
apparent however that the CFO is an
excellent accountant and controller but
is not able to provide the Strategic
support needed in fpna and longer term
strategy vision and investor relations
the idea the CEO and I discussed was
layering them under a new CFO and giving
the current CFO of reduced scope role
this is obviously sticky and delicate
and makes recruiting a bit less
straightforward than usual as it's still
confidential while they search do we
want to possibly bring them into the
deciding process of who to hire for this
job how do we handle
it okay related to that another layering
question that's connected Nolan because
I've seen it happen again into in
startups how should we approach leveling
over what do I do if I'm a new leader
layered in over someone who was not
happy about being layered over and felt
that they should have gotten my
job what advice do you give to someone
who has been layered over and advised to
me where I came in over that person who
is not happy yeah all right so I think
with like layering is a very delicate
situation and uh I will tell you that at
door Dash I essentially lived in fear
every day of getting layered um and
here's here's I think the ultimate
thing no human is perfect at all of the
things period full stop and so I always
say life is about tradeoffs and so the
person that you currently have who is
solving the problem today usually
generally pretty well otherwise you'd
fire them um has some deficiencies and
so the first question for me is is is it
possible for the person to grow in the
areas in which they are
deficient and I think often times that
just gets skipped over like we just stop
Being Human when we talk about like
layering stuff in
organizations I think a big reason why
is because we end up like they're just
so ingrained in the org they're just
around all the time that it's like oh
it's like them and we we should just
take a step back and be a little bit
more thoughtful and strategic about how
we interact with them so first things
first is like can we grow them and if
the answer is yes or maybe then I think
it needs to be how and this is where a
great cheap people officer this should
be their job like if I'm the CEO I
should be being like look I love Kelly
she's awesome this area over here is
like not working super great right now
can you help me figure out a way to grow
her and this is where you can get
coaches where you can get advisers where
you can Loop in board members like
people to help Kelly grow to see if she
can actually do it and give her the shot
because on the other side is you know
recruiting as as a recruiter by trade
what for whatever reason with recruiting
we always think like oh my God like new
candidates going to solve all of our
problems and here's the reality is new
candidate has no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] context on the
organization they have none of the
established relationships built in order
to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done inside of said
organization they're going to like not
know anything for maybe the first like
 
and steer the ship the wrong direction
initially they might be a bad hire
there's so many things where it can go
wrong so my bias and my personal belief
and experience is that you should always
try to make it work with the person
first before considering layering and
then I'll add to it but I want to get
your take first yeah yeah I think and
I've seen it in my career where where we
get all caught up to your point in the
nonhuman aspect oh well you know we're
 
and we need someone who's seen it and
done that and some sometimes that is the
right answer actually but I have seen
everyone jump to that because that's
what everyone else does and the company
pedigree and this and that so I think
your point about is this really
necessary before jumping into that is
important because it it does get skipped
over more often than you think because
that's just the way of the world that's
what you do you know it's best practice
one of our favorite terms and it's not
so um and I also I like your point and I
think it's been underutilized
about coaches kind of coaches but we've
talked about this concept of these
functional guides yeah right these these
Sherpas and and I'm doing it now for you
know a handful of folks where it's not
the exact coaches in the the suits that
are doing nothing but 360s on you all
day long it's actually operators that
have seen success and failures and scars
and Trauma and all the things to help
young leaders like right early career
leaders accelerate their development
faster through having these guides and I
I never really had one when I was in the
role um and I still don't think they're
very common I think it's growing but I
think it's it's it's incredible what
that can do for the
development and the acceleration of that
person being able to do that job so
that's the thing with the op Ator right
Kelly is like they have exact experience
with the the industry the role um and
the context of the problem like that's
where it works where it doesn't work is
like oh I just like I'm friends with
this exec right it's and it just like
makes no sense like you have to have the
context on like it must be a tech
company that is at this stage in size
that this person's been in this role
before and they've solved the types of
problems that we're solving that's where
the magic is um and by the way that
person can also then help guide the CEO
from a third party perspective and say
hey I actually think like you guys
haven't given this person a real shot or
say I actually think you're right like
it's time to layer um and they could
provide a really valuable outside
perspective so let's go back to the
let's go back to the first question
which is around uh this CFO potential
layering situation and what's actually
happening here that our listener has not
stated is that they are running a
confidential search to layer the current
CFO and the current CFO has no idea
what's going
on yes that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up yeah like that's
super [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that's not cool how I
always say like how would you feel if we
were doing this to you and you'd feel
like uh there was something subversive
going on in the relationship uh between
you and the CEO and you and the chap
people officer who is allowing this to
happen so like put things on the table
let people know where you're at let them
know you're talking to other CFOs so you
can understand just like like are my
expectations misaligned or maybe we
should and tell PE when you tell people
early it is often reciprocated in kind
that okay great like yeah this is a
deficiency for me and maybe they start
to admit things that they otherwise
wouldn't have have admitted because
you're putting it on the table for them
so I just think it's like one I think
it's bad for business because now if you
do hire somebody it's gonna be like
surprised you have a new boss and oh by
the way like this is your new role who's
gonna love that environment is that is
that new CFO going to be set up for
Success oh by the way if you hire that
new CFO under that guys like aren't they
always going to have that in the back of
their head aren't all the other execs
going to have that in the back of their
head that this is how you did somebody
really really dirty and then just in
general of like how do you expect that
person to to be able to eat that and to
stay and say oh like okay great I'm just
going to keep doing my best work here
now that you have completely lied to me
about our relationship yeah and it I
mean it compromises the quality of the
search too I mean doing something in
secret and kind of moving around you're
not able to kind of fully fully get out
there and leverage the skill sets of
this really talented CFO to be a part of
it um now let's talk about why that is
you know and we've talked about this
multiple times this year Nolan it comes
down to trust right I mean we've talked
about it when we're an if I'm an
executive and you're the
CEO I don't tell you I plan on leaving
until you know I have another job or
whatnot why because you're going to kick
me out of my ass and I would go so far
to say is this the reverse to this this
caller are you afraid this person will
object and and leave you high and dry
and again I think that the bottom line
here is how you treat someone how you
respect them how you trust them um you
know and thank them for the
contributions to the
company hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors I must admit I used to believe
that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR that is until my friend
Heather do who leads talented signal
fire told me to check out metav I got
into the product and was like Wow AI
actually does EX exist in recruiting and
this product is sick metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruited their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metav view changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out medavie head over to metav
view. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
metav VI's product experts tell them
that me and Kelly sent you or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free you'll be up run and AI enabled
in
minutes okay so let's go back to the
layering so and if I'm the CEO if I'm
you know the chief people officer or to
the second question if I'm the new
executive coming in over someone like
how do you handle that and that's one
thing that I've done so many times in my
career you know over the past you are
the queen at this actually you've done
this a lot well I mean I was really bad
at it early on cuz I was like what the
hell's going on here but I realized in
in 15 years in Venture and if this helps
folks I've had these conversations um in
all three of those roles right the new
leader that was layered over someone the
CPO and then working with the CEO and
talking to folks and like dozens of
times and I will tell
you it doesn't always work it depends on
the maturity and the mindset of the
other person but all you can do is be
honest and for me at least if it's
helpful what that looks like is listen
in these Venture companies if that
person can't grow and be coached up they
they have not failed do you know what I
mean like at some point no human can
develop at a rate in which it's needed
there there are some companies there are
no dude there are some companies that
explode and that rate of development
cannot keep up as what's needed no one
because I hear Look I hear it Kelly but
but Founders can founder Founders are
the exception to this rule I just don't
buy it that's not true Founders can't
there's tons of Founders that don't make
it what are you talking look I when
people say that it's typically coming
from a Founder who is also in over their
skis oh and so that's what I'm saying
yes that that is that is called
unfairness like the pot and the kettle
like whatever hypoc a bad thing but in
some cases it's like listen you you are
an ass kicker you you literally took
this company from Z to one in an inorbit
amount of time very quickly yeah um you
have grown your quadrupled your Mandate
of this job in 18 months like that is
something to be celebrated and very rare
So this person's coming in here that's
done a job that's adex what has
quadrupled for you your role still has
quadrupled and you're probably going to
bring it to 6X of what it was and you're
going to get promotions and you're going
to have room and you're going to all
these things so all I'm saying is if if
the situation is right for it Nolan and
I agree there are all these cases and
all these
combinations what's worked for me in all
these situations is to show people and
try to get them to see that their world
is not shrinking with these changes the
world around them has just expanded so
fast and it's so big that their role is
actually still expanding and I've been
there when you're on the receiving end
all you think think about is they're
screwing me over my job's getting
smaller you you just you see red you
can't see that and that's been helpful
for me to explain that to folks yeah
sometimes it didn't work they got pissy
left the company took a cheap people
officer job because they were annoyed
and then crashed and burned called me a
year and a half later fine that's okay
you got to learn but that that's been
helpful for me and for yeah I I
so the the only other thing I would add
to that is I think you so Henry said
this at Carta and it I'd never heard
anybody say it and it is I I think about
it all the time now when I interact with
early employees is it's really easy for
the new executive to forget everything
it took to get to that point and I I
honestly think we should be celebrating
early employees yes a lot more than we
currently do in in Venture yeah and my
simp thing on that is don't be as like
don't be an idiot like you know what I
mean but it's so easy like this is this
is the the fail state for a new
executive coming in is like well God
look at all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
it it's just it's so easy to come in and
be like that's why they hired me versus
like understanding that there are many
things broken there will continue to be
many things broken but that look at how
well the company's doing right now and
it's only doing this well because this
person helped us get here yes and I
think if you could just reframe into
that mode if you can publicly celebrate
the person um if you could just do like
those it it's like this sort of like
human like
maneuvering to make them still feel like
God thank God you've been here thank God
you continue to be here make them feel
uh wanted um because that's what also
happens during layering stuff is like
typically the CEO doesn't do a good job
of making sure that that person still
feels like they're important in the
organization and so I think you can do
those things and then that sets you up
for major success inside the company
because then once you're there and
you're doing those things they're more
likely to want to help you which you
need and then your job is is to add
value to that person's life by removing
barriers by helping them grow by just
being like the the per the Shepherd that
they didn't have and so I think that's
that's my take on it for the new
executive I think from the employee
who's getting layered standpoint which
is the other you know part to of
question
 
is I I honestly think like taking some
time and like take a breather because it
it does get you get so attached to these
roles these roles become part of your
identity and what ends up happening is
is you know when the layering
conversation happens all of a sudden you
feel like part of your identity has been
Stripped Away From You MH and and it has
like you've You' lived it you've you've
you've bled you've you've cried you've
lived through like these hard moments of
building a company and now all of a
sudden somebody's coming in to be your
boss that has no context that hasn't
been there that hasn't lived it and all
I could tell you is try and think of the
future version of
yourself and you have two paths One path
is is you're
spiteful the other path
is you're gracious to the new person
coming in
and I think the future version of
yourself will be very thankful if you're
gracious of the new person coming in
yeah and I'll I'll add to that I think a
a key ingredient to help you be gracious
is to spend time outside of your company
and make sure you're using some time to
get perspective to meet other people
yeah right because I'm just speak for
myself like when I am so in it and
that's all you do that's all you see
that's all you can see I mean you're
just gripping so tight that you you
can't see anything else and you know
building the networks getting to know
how other companies are doing this
talking to other people like you're just
gonna you're going to be more balanced
and healthy I think to be able to see
that in a different way to to question
onea so funny onea have you seen back to
school with the rotting danger field and
that I have one question with 27 Parts
no definitely not years older here folks
back to school great film um yeah I just
think the the the external perspective
is so helpful in so many ways sometimes
we we're not even aware it's helping
it's literally subconscious in our
energy yeah you have no idea actually
how many people that either you're close
with or that you admire have been
exactly in your
shoes yeah it's almost like a write a
passage in fact like this is like one of
those like really hard lessons to learn
on the journey is man you feel like
you've been doing everything you've been
like committed a thousand and that's
that's also like part of the devil right
Kelly is like you're so in it that it is
your identity and now they're like oh by
the way like you have a new apost you're
like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this like I've
been living it the way you told me
because you built something of value
that is now exactly bigger than you like
getting layered means you are have been
successful if you are not getting
layered you're might be getting laid off
because you have not been successful in
building something bigger than yourself
and what Kelly is saying sounds trite in
the moment like it does like it hearing
you say sound TR I well but like you
know just the emotional aware of that
person of like oh great like yeah I've
built this thing that's so successful
next time I'm going to hold on to my
chips so like you know it's not you know
and it's it's just not you're you're
exactly right Kelly it's just hard to
hear here and remember what I said five
minutes ago this really depends on the
person who's receiving the
message like it really depends on their
maturity on their perspective who they
are as an individual I mean this isn't
like Cookie Cutter stuff it lands with
everyone differently there's a comp
factors on that these are great
questions this is a great yeah this is a
great topic keep sending these in Guys
these are really good all right HR
