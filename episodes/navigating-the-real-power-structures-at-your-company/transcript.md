hey everybody welcome back to another
episode of HR Heretics today we have
Andrew bartlo with us Andrew is a
multi-time VP of HR head of people he's
been at big companies he's been at small
companies across multiple types of
companies VC private Equity public uh he
now leads a people accelerator and is a
a solopreneur and consultant Andrew
thanks so much for being on the show
we're stoked to have you hey likewise I
I'm a fanboy of HR Heretics uh thanks
for having
me we have won ran we have one we should
I should also tell the audience Kelly's
not feeling well but she is a trooper
and is and is here today dedication at
its finest doll r not have a new host it
is me it is me she's she's showing up to
work all right so as I mentioned in the
lead in Andrew you have experience
across Venture across private equity and
across public companies what are the
differences working at each of those
different types of companies sure um and
hey it might be helpful you check out my
LinkedIn profile you can see the whole
career Journey I'll I'll try to give
like a very very quick nickel tour of
like all right so what what type of
experience do I have so
 
Fortune 100 to less than 100 employees I
I think my first top job I was 23 at a
startup that I took from 20 to 120 to
zero um since then I've been an angel a
uh LP and actually a startup founder I
have my own you know B2B s product that
I continue to you know send send money
into and get no money out doing the true
founder Journey um I'm an operating
partner and adviser for a mid-market uh
private Equity company um and you know
I've spent decades at Enterprise
organizations and at M mid-market
organizations so I've got the VC do a
bunch of advising and mentoring and uh
worked in in VC backed companies I've
got the PE where I've worked in them
three four times and now I'm a PE
operating partner and then I've got the
public company experience uh you know
from decades at places like Pepsi and GE
and Wells Fargo and you name
it um all right so maybe that was more
than a nickel what was the question
again what's different about the three
yeah yeah I I think the the biggest
difference is stage stage of maturity
where there are different needs for
different
seasons so if you're in high growth
startup um chances are you are really
focused on product Market fit and
building your company the infrastructure
and Recruitment and building a team like
it is the the classic hockey stick where
you're hoping to figure that out that's
a different pace those are different
movements then if you're at the other
end of the spectrum let's say you're a
tour public company that's been in
business for decades and been public for
decades the founders are probably no
longer involved you've got uh big public
uh investors uh mutual fund companies
you have a professional management team
that has been trained at a bunch of
different places um and it's an
optimization exercise you're trying to
eek out um or maintain your existing
profitability um it's it's no longer the
the build it's the optimize and then in
between is PE and PE can take a couple
of different flavors of a value creation
plan so and we can talk more about this
I I hope we do like PE could be a
turnaround environment uh where maybe
you're bloated and unprofitable and you
need to fix it um or you're a you're a
Kodak and you're being taken over by the
digital age and you need to totally
change what's going on uh it could be a
professionalization it could be a
Founder moving on or there's a you know
handing over the keys to the Next
Generation and you know that that's a
different value creation plan um it
could also be a growth story where maybe
your company's not prepped to go IPO
maybe that doesn't make sense for your
size and you just want to you know get
get some growth Capital um and you know
that could be an m&amp;a story it could be
organic growth I've worked on both so
that I think there are kind of three or
four classic value creation strategies
in
PE and and that can get really
interesting you know so it's each one of
those is different from Venture on one
end to public company on the extreme
other and then a couple of different
flavors of ice cream in the middle uh
which is PE yeah it might be a
generalization Andrew but if you're any
business leader do you have certain like
personality characteristics or things
that people like or don't like or that
they're good at or they're not good at
or that they care about or they don't
care about like how do I choose PE
public or or or private
Venture um I think a lot of it has to do
with your prior experience um with your
desires with what are you good at um
with understanding what you're getting
into you know if you've only been at
Walmart and you're thinking about
jumping into a 100 person you know
series b super hot startup uh that is a
massively different
environment um so do do you really want
to do that are you sure you want to do
that like that the work the work is
different um the the players are
different as well the power structure is
different um and the behaviors might be
different so so I I think there's a
large element of self-reflection about
what do I want to do and am I good at as
you as you change contexts and I don't
think there are a whole lot of
us like me that have been in all three
and have had arguably you know decent
success in in all three um and maybe
some of that was that I got those
experiences early so I could keep
building on them and even if I skinned
my knee uh 20 years ago I I learned I I
learned from it and I did a little
better the second third and fourth time
around it's a really interesting take or
you said power structure yeah and um
there was a tweet over the weekend where
someone said uh not only does company
culture change depending on how the
company is funded but also like the way
that the company operates so for example
like if you're a venture back tech
company we're thinking about future
profits we're not thinking about massive
profits today and so the way that you
operate is it's just like we're growing
and all we're in we think thinking about
his growth versus you know if you're a
public company or private Equity backed
company profits are the thing that
matters for the most part and so that
trickles down into the culture and into
the operators I'm I'm curious have you
experienced that and is that one of the
things that you realized working across
all of these different company types
this might be my Golden Nugget for our
um conversation you that the power
structure how decisions are made what
your stake who your stakeholders are and
what they care about really matters in
your organization so let's let's work
through it a little bit maybe I can give
a a tangible example so in a startup
early stage Founders are typically still
involved we're talking series ABC
they're certainly still involved as you
get successive rounds of funding you are
selling off 10 to 20% of the company at
each
round of fundraising could be more like
that you know times are tough right now
so by the time you get to series B
certainly
C your founder or Founders probably no
longer have full decision-making control
over their organization they they could
in theory Be You Know Travis kenck you
know Bill Gurley you know voted out of
their of their own company we're talking
about Uber um now that very very rarely
happens because of the incentive set up
in Venture Capital where if you get to
be known for displacing your Founders
you nobody's going to want your money
nobody's going to want your investment
anymore right so it's possible but it's
super rare So generally what I'm saying
is in VC that the Founder's view drives
things that the founder is the driver
the Visionary the executor they they
make the company go and they are almost
never the the plug is almost never
pulled on them it's up to
them on the other far end of the
spectrum is the public company and
you're right it's about profit it's
about optimization it's about quarterly
earnings and even though we talk about
longterm and you know Warren Buffett
looks at you know GE and and Coca-Cola
over decades he he actually doesn't like
he he'll sell off those companies if uh
if things aren't aren't looking good
over a couple of quarters uh so it it's
a fairly short cycle in public companies
um the the investors matter a lot more
in public companies uh you can change
out board members you can change you can
certainly change out executive team
members you know pretty quickly
including CEOs CEO turnover is
relatively high at public companies it's
as high as any other professional
job we we could dig up some stats on
that in the Middle with PE um again it's
kind of of a blend where there's some
incentives where if you're a familyowned
business that the founders involved if a
PE company has a reputation for
displacing the founder you might not
want their money right um but there are
different incentives involved you know
it the PE firm that I work with only
does control Investments so they have at
least 51% of the voting shares and they
can display but they they avoid it they
really consciously try to avoid it not
just because of the next investment
because it but because it's like
massively disruptive you really want it
to work with the executive team and the
founders and and the people that are
there
um but but it doesn't always work like
it depends what's going on um if you're
at a growth strategy PE firm then you
might need people that have been through
the growth process that have been there
done that and have seen things at two
three 4X where they are
today um some companies uh get scooped
up by pe as as you know uh they're
they're Financial saviors where they're
losing money there's massive burn they
can't go IPO like sadly I think we're
seeing more of that in Venture back tech
where there isn't another round of
funding and they get scooped up by by
some PE and then they go make the tough
decisions that that those Founders were
unwilling to make um so yes it comes
back this is a very long answer it comes
back to your stakeholders what their
interests are and I think once again
there the the founders have a ton of
control in VC backed
companies um the investors have the
massive amount of control in public
companies and PE somewhere in the middle
with some different strains or flavors
of that based off of what the situation
the company and the strategy the value
creation plan of the PE firm is talk to
me about when you come in in for because
you're an adviser um and and
specifically for for a private Equity
Firm and so when you come in and you do
a talent assessment for a new
investment what does that look like yeah
um the way I do it uh there there are a
couple variations um The Firm that I
work with primarily uh tends to go light
on the formal assessment uh
methodologies meaning we don't do a
Hogan we don't do a wonderlick we don't
um you know do do a dis profile the the
psychometric assessments there's a
feeling that that's like too heavyweight
and it creates this you know pseudo
academic
distancing um instead what I do is I go
in and I talk to people um I usually
don't fly around it's usually over over
a video conference M much like this I'll
spend an hour with with all the key
people and often a heck of a lot more
than that might be two three four
follow-ups with a founder or the sales
leader or a key member of the team to
understand uh what are you looking for
out of this investment what are your
expectations um what do you want to make
sure happens or doesn't happen to
maximize or optimize the outcomes of
this investment so I'll I'll have these
conversations and I'll I'll do that in a
pretty
straightforward um you know friendly
friendly way because you know the in the
deal hasn't happened yet it's diligence
so there's still some some element so
you're coming in during the diligence
phase and this got it okay almost always
coming in for the first time during
diligence before the deal has closed
where the current owners of the company
could still pull out or still choose
another investor so there's some element
of getting to know each other and
building Trust
and identifying what that value creation
plan actually is and and you want to
hear it from the people um and I don't
mean every person I can't talk to you
know hundreds or thousands of people in
some of these companies but you usually
go you know at least one layer down from
the CEO sometimes two could be a dozen
or a couple of dozen
conversations and that pulls out some
themes of what that group identifies
that they need now I put that through
the filter of almost 30 years doing this
work and having seen lots of different
companies go through whatever Journey
they're planning to go through uh so
maybe it's um m&amp;a fueled growth maybe
it's a bunch of organic new Green Field
you know sites that are opening up maybe
it's you know could could be a lot of
different things and so I I put it
through my filter of is what they think
they
need how well does that match up with
what I think they need and with what I'm
hearing from the investors with what
their um anticipation and their
assumptions are about what the value
creation plan is and then I'll call out
where that might be the same or that
might be different um and so I'll put
together a um anticipated or proposed
future state or chart I'll go that far
even during diligence to say like hey I
think you probably want to add a chief
Revenue officer person that you have
running it is great they got you to this
stage you don't necessarily need to let
that person go but you might want to put
somebody in that has seen massive
business expansion and led a a big team
before I I might make that proposal and
then the you know assuming the
investment happens the leadership team
and the investor can make a decision
whether or not to do that and if so when
uh but I'll make my thirdparty
uh informed but disinterested I guess
I'm interested to an extent because I'm
I'm an investor in the fund um make make
my recommendation as to what it would
take to get the value creation that they
hope to get out of it um and I'll pull
together a report that might be 15 20
pages long I'll have some red yellow
green on existing uh leadership team
with some commentary I'll have a current
and future State org chart I'll have
suggested roles to fill
suggested sequencing estimated cost also
do some um analysis of what they look
like to the outside world so I'll go on
LinkedIn and glass door and all the
social media places and see if anything
odd pops up uh one company I found a
bunch of fake reviews um that they had
obviously dropped in themselves uh so I
flagged that and said we we should
probably look into this what's going on
um yeah so you know I I talked to the
um I take a look at to see whatever
might be publicly available to the
outside world and I make some
suggestions about how to get this
organization to where it can create the
value that the PE firm wants to find out
of it but I don't I don't make those
final calls I just make those
recommendations hey everyone we'll be
right back in a moment after a word from
our sponsors Real Talk most Talent
leaders haven't yet cracked how to
leverage AI for Meaningful impact on
their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting team's efficiency and quality

the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a time saer because perfect

here's a crazy stat between hybrid and
Frontline employees about 80% don't
typically work in an office so it's no
surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun
that's where work Vivo zoom's employee
experience platform comes in if you've
ever recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive
accessible and mobile First Tool people
actually like using it which is why
companies like ryion Aire Dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands of

we sit at a desk or drive a truck make
work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human

a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics
 
say Andrew I'm curious what are the
biggest questions you get from the
founders like what do they ask you the
most about the firm or the
transaction and you know what are their
biggest
concerns yeah well there there's usually
some degree of skepticism of like hey
we've heard you know PE doesn't have the
best reputation in the world and so I I
get to share my personal story of having
worked at three maybe four depending how
you count the
iterations um of PE backed firms that
were all bad
experiences the internal experiences
that I had were like as head of HR uh
for what went on to become Invitation
Homes uh we had a number of private
Equity sponsors in and out over the
years and you know there was a lot of
financial engineering there wasn't a lot
of management consulting support um it
was like the the smartest guy in the
room would come in and like tell you
something unkindly and not really listen
to you know what what your plan was to
uh build the business um I get to tell
my story of my experience with the firm
that I work with who come from a
management consulting backgrounds that
you know many of them come from Bane and
so they active look at organizations
where they think they can add unique
value through um building a management
team and building some level of
structure and process and that's why my
role exists at all it's because we think
it can be helpful and so I share hey I
get it bad rep but that's not these guys
uh this group and I think I'm an example
I'm having this conversation with you
founder and your team to figure out how
we can help and how we can make sure
that we don't screw screw it up along
the way we want to hear from you um so
their their
initial question or the question behind
the question is hey what will this
relationship really look like if I'm
giving up control of my organization
what does that mean for me and will it
be in good hands and will we be partners
or will you be my you know investor
overlords um and and that's something
that you know can be really challenging
for owners and Founders or or the kids
of Founders to sort
through as somebody who grew up in VC
I've been hanging out with more private
Equity people recently and I think one
of the misnomers around private Equity
is once an investment is made the
management team gets fired and replaced
with a new management team and what I've
been uh as I've been talking to to and
making more friends in private equity
and learning how that ad actually
operates their biggest they've told me
is to not do that because that is
incredibly disruptive to the business
like they want to keep the management
team in place but some of the problems
uh that exist is like hey we've just put
this massive investment in oftentimes it
comes with a liquidity event for the
founder or the the entire management
team and they may not be as motivated to
keep working and so that's actually like
one of the reasons why and I I think
again this misnomer has been perpetuated
but it's not necessarily true but there
are cases when you come in and you say
this person is not like is not the right
fit uh for what we need going forward
given where we want to take the company
Y how do you how do you think about the
second order of that of like we just put
in a new investment now we're ripping
out either the founder or the executive
how does that team then like trust the
investors to move forward like what does
that process look like yeah I I I think
it starts with that openness in that
partnership and hey if um Le let's use
the example of you have a Founder owner
founder group that um has has had an
exit where they're still involved with
the business but the PE firm now has has
control um you would you would do
everything you can to retain that
founder leader because they know how
this worked they got it to where it is
and they want to be with you on on the
next stage of the journey so us they're
rolling in some form of equity into the
deal um so they'll get a significant
payout and then they'll have you know
golden handcuffs you know some form of
LTI um on the next
exit um so how do you deal with the
potential for change it's having those
direct conversations about we made this
investment at you here our plan together
is to get you to whatever it is four 4ex
in the next 3 to seven years Forex
valuation we think we can do that
through a combination of mergers and
Acquisitions mul multiple
expansion uh expanded distribut like
what whatever it is whatever the plan is
and then the question is what's it going
to take to get there and we want the
operators to operate we want the leaders
to make the decisions the investors will
bring resources and support where you
can be better informed and you'll have
access resources like like me that you
know a founder-led company would would
never know who I am would never know who
my peers are um and probably wouldn't
make the choice to spend you know the
the capital to get that input
so I you know potentially long way of
saying you have the conversation
directly with with the leader and you
put your map together uh almost like a
product road map you have your talent
map of what do we think it will take
what's the sequencing as well to get to
where we want to be um and if you're if
you're doing it right as the investor
you're not jumping in over the top of
the CEO owner and saying You must do
this you must do that because then that
you know just like you said Nolan the
the founder former owner CEO decides
it's not for them anymore and they
they've got the they've got the fu money
and they can walk away if they want to
um so it
it's I I wouldn't say it's totally
dispat passionate I wouldn't say it's
totally unemotional because there's
actually a lot of fear in disruption
like if anything there's fear from the
investor of like we don't want to we
don't want to screw this up we don't
want to disrupt things by pulling people
out that there are relationships and
there is a track record so if anything
the investor is often adding resources
or really encouraging some incremental
investment and then it's up to the
leader to decide okay well you do we do
we continue to need some of the people
that are that are in here or am I seeing
the value and usually the first hire is
a CFO you know CFO to do where where
usually they've never really had a
professional CFO and there's a lot more
reporting and a lot more analysis and
they start to see that uh the value of
that and they're they're more willing to
hire a professional HR leader or they're
more willing to hire a chief of staff to
handle the value creation plan I think
it's a really good point about the
disruption and we've talked of this you
know in another episodes Nolan but even
if the company isn't doing that great
right even if it's mediocre or yellow in
the spirit of real red yellow and green
you know often it's it's a mistake to
make a bunch of changes and think it's
going to go to green usually goes to Red
pretty quickly if you change it too much
even if it is yellow so I do appreciate

[Music]
peel I feel like I've talked to a few PE
firms recently and I love both of your
takes on this I feel like they're trying
to actively change a bit of the the rrap
they're getting they've gotten over the
years of being the Grim Reaper that's
evil and fires everybody and takes
control and I i' I've heard for the
first time in years them actively
bringing that up in conversations
unsolicited that they're trying to do
things differently to your earlier point
of we're different we're not like that I
mean are you both seeing that out there
yeah I can start so I went to Capitol
Camp last year and it's a it's a very
large um PE distribution of folks that
that go there and this was a this was
the thing that I was asking is just like
hey like why do you guys do this and and
I think what I had heard from folks is
we you it used to be how the business
primarily operated and that's why like
the the WAP sheet like came about but
nowadays like they've seen the second
order effects of when they leave
Founders in place and when they displace
Founders and we executive teams and it's
so much better to have the founder in
place because they have not only all the
relationships but all the context on the
business and so I think it did happen in
the past but I think it's changing
that's but what I've seen Andrew what
have you
seen yeah I I think there are some
influences about the the broader macro
environment so um yeah I think there's
there's broader awareness that your
reputation matters that you know if if
and when there is Choice you'll choose a
Capital Partner that's more likely to
work with you there's not always choice
and so when I talk about the macro
environment if we have Venture back
technology startups that are still
burning no matter how much they're
they're cutting at at some point they're
going to have to either close the doors
or get investment
somewhere um so I I think that it's wise
for PE firms to manage their reputation
I I also think that there will be a lot
of uh uh Scoops uh coming up over the
upcoming uh few years meaning there will
be some PE firms that that go in and and
scoop up some intellectual property from
some failing Venture backback PE uh some
some PE firms that scoop up some failing
Venture back tech companies
IP um that will likely lay off all the
people and uh merge together a couple of
businesses so I I I'd be shocked if I
didn't see some of that happen that's
not the sort of work that I do that the
uh firm that I do most of my work with
doesn't get involved in Tech at all
which is really funny for me I have a
foot fir firmly planted in Venture back
tech and a foot firmly planted in you
know air quote real
companies
um yeah so I I think there's awareness
of
relationship um but I think that
relationship um or that reputation will
get stressed over the next couple of
years as we see the Fallout from the
current macro
cycle yep let's transition a bit and
talk about the CEO and chief people
officer head of people
relationship and I'm really interested
in examples of where you've seen these
relationships not go well and what
you've learned about those situations
where the relationship hasn't gone well
um I can speak both firsthand I've been
in enough jobs where I've stub stubbed
my toe and you know had had some bruised
relationships um as well as from some
without naming names um I've mentored I
don't know a 100 plus HR leaders at this
point either one-on-one or through
people leader
accelerator um I I think a strong theme
is where there's
misalignment of
expectations let's let's peel that apart
a little bit so misalignment of
expectations might be and you know this
you know here's a personal anecdote um
one of my first top jobs I interviewed
with the CEO founder and I asked what he
wanted out of HR and this leader said I
want you to keep me out of trouble I
want you to keep us out of jail it's
like oh that's not what I wanted that's
the wrong answer that's not what I
wanted to hear I wanted to hear how HR
is a strategic uh uh function and will
help us meet our goals and how we can do
all these you know wonderful things to
add value to the to the organization and
the employee base
and
um and I took the job anyway it ended up
being it ended up leading to my first uh
public company chro job and that founder
ended up exiting the business with the
uh ownership change and I continued on
through several so I outlasted the
founder in that
case um but
we while we have a cordial and
continuing relationship there was always
some friction like he he was always
trying to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
done and he never really wanted to bring
anybody in close to give suggestions and
advice about how to do things um and I
wanted nothing more than to be that
conary than to be close than to than to
be helpful and useful and so we always
had a little bit of a little bit of
tension in terms of why is Andrew not
stay in his Lane like just just do just
do these traditional people Ops and
recruiting things why why is he got to
act like the COO and you know weigh in
on all this stuff like there's always a
little bit of tension there um so that
that's an example of where it doesn't
necessarily go that well and would he
hire me again I I don't I don't know um
probably not would I work for him again
probably not um but it was the right
move for me at that point in my career
like my first you know what turned into
my first public company uh HR gig and
that that really helped make my career
and allowed me to go independent and you
know do do all this good stuff uh maybe
to expand on the example um where where
does it go
wrong if the HR leader is trying to do
things that the business leader CEO
doesn't get doesn't connect with doesn't
value um that's where you just never you
never really have a true relationship
you're a service provider um you get
relegated you get put out on HR Island
and frankly a lot of HR people do that
to themselves we work on HR stuff rather
than the key business stuff like we
don't take the time to really understand
what is this organization trying to
accomplish I know Kelly you and I have
talked a little bit about this yeah for
sure for sure I mean Andrew how do you
what is the best way that we can assess
that of a CEO or a CEO founder in the
process how they see us like how they
want us to be involved yep you know um I
mentioned I'm a fanboy right so I listen
to every minute of your episodes and I
think Jeff Diana just killed it as as he
talked about uh spending time with CEO
Founders like if they're willing to
engage and willing to go deep and
willing to have that second third fourth
conversation about the business and you
know talk about how you would handle
certain situations or LJ as he talked
about get to that point of fatality yeah
as soon as possible I'd suggest
especially if you're senior in your
career and you have some
choices I'm fortunate enough at this
point but you know again I think Kelly
you said this well not everybody does
some people are still trying to make it
in their career um try to get to that
point of fatality during the interview
process like try to get to that
crossroads of like hey this is a real
decision Point are we going to work well
together or are we not and let's make a
good Mutual decision I I think that's
how you can assess it early on a and to
expand on the idea of choices are
different at different stages I was
willing to take that riskier likely
tension filled relationship to get to
that next level of my career to get the
public company Cho job and I slogged it
out and I wrestled with it and I was
worried I'd get fired many days and he
probably thought about firing me many
days um but it ended up working out and
the company ended up doing really well
and and I continued on and so I I think
there is something about being willing
to take on risk being willing to take on
nonperfect
situations life is about trade-offs
right like I mean that's that's a
perfect example of one I want to go back
to HR Island yeah uh I I love that
phrase and I think it's um it deeply
resonates with me and mistakes that I've
made in my career which is working on
things that I think are most important
for the business without having
alignment with the
CEO yep and I often feel like when
you're operating inside of a business
you know you just get to these
relationships to where it's like oh like
like yeah Nolan but I I don't know like
I don't know if we should do that uh and
then I'm doing everything I can to try
and convince the CEO and I just like
can't get over that hump of convincing
them and so I end up like wanting to do
it and I end up doing it and then it
ends up costing relationship Capital
because the CEO wanted me to focus on
something else how do you advise HR
leaders
who can see the like car crash coming
yeah and want to focus on something else
but the CEO is is pushing them in the
other
direction I I
usually start with and this might be
non-intuitive
asking the HR leader to take a second
and third look at their own motivations
and their own judgment here like if the
CEO is pushing you in a different
direction why is that like what is not
resonating it's not necessarily that you
need to sell harder or say it
differently like what what's going on
there and I'll I'll be direct it's
usually that the HR person is pushing a
air quote Best practice it's usually
that there's a Playbook that they're
trying to roll out or a best practice
that that they like to do or think would
be useful that may not be the most
important thing to that leader right now
and and connection hasn't been made um
we lean far too often I include myself
on this in it's the right thing to do or
I know this will work or here are some
very generalized statistics about the
correlation of Employee Engagement to
productivity well who cares if your
product road map is is off track or
you're not making your ARR uh growth
numbers like you don't need a lot of
these nice to haves nice to have
programs that we often come to the table
with if some Core Business metrics
aren't coming together and that's
usually where there's a mismatch yeah I
was talking to some the other day and
they're like well our engagement scores
are 90 something percent our H HR team
is crushing it like dancing skipping
around and like yeah revenue is in the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toilet so what what are you doing
doesn't matter doesn't matter nothing
matters does matter and these these
goals that I think we've all always well
not always but myself too 20 years ago
we we put these things as the end they
are the goal and they're not they are a
means to a goal obviously happy
employees help revenue and create happy
customers but they are not the end in
itself and I think that is something
that is changing yeah compare that to
another functions numbers like Le let's
say that you are in digital marketing
and you were trying to optimize for
conversion and you want to get as close
to 100% customer conion as possible well
you set up these like awkward filters
where if you get through the filters
you're you're going to convert is that
actually increasing revenue or not like
what what you're trying to do is
optimize for the true bottom line and
bottom line end result for the business
and I think we've gotten stuck as a
function too often on some of the some
of these secondary indicators that's
right like we we've set up these people
indicators separate and apart from The
Core Business metrics that we should be
trying to trying to drive and we we
would benefit ourselves and our
organizations and our relationships with
our CEO Founders much more if we started
with what is the business outcome that
we're trying to drive and that's not
engagement engagement is not what we're
trying to drive that's right we're
trying to optimize engagement not
maximize it yes and that's how it gets
to the island Nolan like do not make it
an island make it a pit stop on the way
to the end goal which is the business
metrics and I'll go back to episode one
with Patty I mean she said it back in
October like what what are your HR
metrics what are you how do you know
you're successful it's the same metrics
and the the company The Business Leaders
have yeah so do you think HR leaders
over index on engagement oh yeah oh heck
yeah of course we do
um you know Ju Just Like recruiters uh
no no offense intended Nolan you know
over index on filling jobs totally right
like what's time to
fill um butts and seats uh Employee
Engagement uh employee satisfaction
attrition these are secondary and
tertiary metrics what really matters is
are we hitting our Revenue goals are we
are we building our company are we
hitting our profitability goals if
you're a public company or a PE firm Are
we um you know tracking along to our
value creation plan if you're if you're
a PE backed firm um and and sometimes
engagement or hiring is part of that but
let's not get lost about the connections
yeah and maybe you know here's here's
maybe a spicy take the reason that we
get stuck on some of these secondary
metrics one is we we as a function don't
have as much business grounding as many
CFOs and Coos do like we come we come
from the world of project management or
recruiting or office management rather
than you know
mbas uh so we don't have the
foundational business grounding you as
as
commonly um
two there a lot of hrp you know I I
blame the hiring managers I blame the
CEOs there are lot of HR leaders that
are hired from recruiting manager
leaders or that are mid-level HR
practitioners that overnight become
heads of HR or VPS of HR and you haven't
had the benefit of multiple Cycles in
the top job um you know Kelly you've
done it multiple times I've done it
multiple times there's um there's
something different if you've been there
done that um in terms of understanding
how it fits together versus being versus
executing on the plan like designing the
plan versus executing on the plan if
you're executing on it your visibility
might be to those secondary metrics if
you're building the plan your visibility
is on the primary metrics like
Revenue
iates it it does another thing I've seen
though is um you know we run these
engagement surveys now some companies
are running them two or four times a
year and you put this number out and the
number is not getting better um and
often times it like the numbers like
getting worse and it looks like lower
engagement and and so what you want to
do the human nature is is like this
number is attached to me I want to make
that number go up um and so I I have
I've come to this this is my take on
this and people vinant disagree with me
I think engagement is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] metric
like I don't know why we do it as much
as we do I don't know why we set the
expectations that we do with engagement
that like hey like we're going to run
this survey and then the number comes
back bad and then we don't do anything
about it it's like a we miscalibrated
with employees we misc calibrate with
our boss who's the CEO like why do we do
this I I don't understand it at all I
will tell you here comes the Heretics
that like yeah we do it because everyone
else [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does it and we were trained
to do it and I will tell you 24 years
ago I was trained that these secondary
metrics that we're all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on are
the
metrics I was doing time to fill I was
grabbing these things very strongly we
were trained to do these things that
that is why and that is why you hear
Playbook best practice everyone's
throwing up on these terms now and now I
also don't want to throw the baby out
with the bath water and say well
playbooks are all terrible cuz that's
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like some things actually work
uh and so I don't want to swing the
pendulum too far but but that's what's
going on here in Nolan and now you're
probably going to hear all these people
we hate engagement and be we're the cool
guys I do think there is some value in
some barometer though like you know if
it's if it's bright red or bright green
like there's something going on there if
it comes out in the wash like whatever
but there's there's some value and some
barometer I think especially at the
bookends and maybe we I I hate the term
engagement maybe it's called something
else that we talked about this trial
work trials but well yeah you're right I
hate the I hate the term for sure but I
think the other piece that that um you
spur a thought for me is is around the
expectation setting like we're not going
to set the people road map based off the
engagement survey that there you go
there you go how are you deciding what
to do as an HR leader so I don't know if
I stole this for somebody or made up
this quote one of the one of the most
important roles of a leader is deciding
what you and your team will work
on that is the definition of strategy
what will we work on what are our goals
and then you know the tactics is is um
is following from that um and if you're
just getting yanked around by Frontline
employees who want to get paid
more you're going to have more programs
you're going to have more time off
you're going to have more and more stuff
that might not be directly connected to
driving business value maybe it is um
but often it's not and so like Who Who
Are You Listening To to decide what to
do and if you can't draw from your own
experience and if we have lots of people
that are in the job for the first time
and with the explosion of easy capital
and lots of lots of companies getting
funded lots of people were in the job
for the first time and they were just
doing their best and the CEOs usually
don't know what good HR looks like you
know CEOs usually don't know what good
companies look like especially if
they're early career Founders that are
fresh Stanford dropouts that got funded
right so they're they're trying to you
know craft their own Journey so and then
you hire an HR leader that doesn't
necessarily know what good looks like
either so that I mean that's one of the
reasons why I do people leader
accelerators try to help people get
better grounded in what does good look
like and that way you can educate your
CEO founder um rather than getting
yanked around by whatever dinner they
went to over the weekend and whatever
best practice like I remember my CEO
went to a dinner with Tony Shay from uh
from zapo and he wanted to implement
holoc on a Monday I hate Mondays because
the CEO would always come in with these
wildass ideas that I would have to burn
Capital to talk them out of oh my God
that deeply resonates by the way like I
have I have lived that exact life where
it's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what what's going to
happen on Monday like who did he go to
dinner with this weekend yeah yeah back
to the engagement question Kelly I love
that you bring the Nuance to the
discussion around engagement like
engagement can be useful but it
shouldn't be like the primary
indicator um think of it like a
speedometer or an oil um pressure on in
your car do do we even have oil I drive
a Tesla I don't know what dials are on
cars anymore
um is an 82 good in engagement yeah
maybe like in the early days engagement
tends to be really strong usually you go
through a J curve as you get funding and
your leadership CH team changes so as
you get bigger your your initial
Builders are no longer as content and so
you go through this period of discontent
and then uh satisfaction starts to ramp
back up I find it's useful to track your
own Employee Engagement over time and
see if there's a big drop off from one
year or one cycle to the next see if
there's a low spot in one function or
one group than another and then you can
go intervene and do something about it
but the companies that I see engagement
or emps be one of their big five company
goals I think that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
that's just irrelevant I mean I just see
so many companies and not just HR
leaders all Business Leaders that we
become so hyperbolic about these things
and it's it's just not like they're not
good they're not bad they're not left
they're not right it's it's what's going
on in the context of that business at
that moment with that team and how do
you put it all together and you said
something a few minutes ago Andrew and
I'm going to challenge it and you said
well we got this score what is that HR
leader going to do about it and the
first thing I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do about it is go
into the SE suite and talk about it in
the context of the greater puzzle of
what's happening in the organization
like what if our engagement score is is
yellow or red and we're crushing Revenue
goals and our attrition numbers are
extremely low like what's going on there
like it doesn't mean we go roll out like
pinball machines and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] CS like
what what that that's something odd
that's something different um and your
same example around comp like we start
with let's educate what we're doing
let's not create new stuff let's
actually talk about what we're doing
first and so we can jump to these
conclusions
um very quickly and take action that
that usually isn't the bullseye of
what's happening and it's usually this
massive drawn out bureaucratic
administrative exercise where every
group does their own analysis and
readout and everybody has their own
action plan totally and like what what's
actually useful it's it's something much
simpler and more streamlined usually and
they Shi the action plan four months
later it's time it's time for the next
survey but that's and the and the survey
is anonymous so you don't actually know
who said what you can't go do something
about it you I I mentioned my own little
you know SAS uh startup that's one of
the things I think is fundamental you
have to have attributable feedback yes
so like who who needs help if you can't
raise your own hand if you're not
willing to raise your own hand to say
you want to have a conversation or I
need help then you don't deserve help or
don't throw it in a survey if you're
worried about
attribution uh coming back to you in in
retribution like go have another
conversation at that point the
relationship's broken anyway and you
probably be better off voting with your
feet if you're unwilling to ask for help
at that point that's well said you guys
have just like banged on all of like my
my core issues here so you know audience
we would love to hear like other views
of this as to like why you run your
people team uh road map based off of the
engagement survey I can't understand it
for the life of me but like we are open
to other ideas we should call this
episode survey says like family Family
Feud survey says engagement surveys blow
um
okay so Andrew you had a hot take on
LinkedIn around a few I've had a few hot
takes on LinkedIn for sure [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I I
appreciate that if you couldn't tell um
one of those takes is that HR leaders
shouldn't make as much as their
peers uh why do you believe that all
right so you're you're calling me out on
my clickbait headline on he does that's
what he does it's it's brilliant he knew
it was coming you know I so a spicy
headline and all right I'll stand by it
most HR
leaders don't act like Executives don't
act like broad-based business Executives
for all the reasons that we just talked
about right you're focused on secondary
metrics you're not really as closely
connected to the business outcomes as
you could and should be and if you're
not acting like a broad-based business
executive you might have the title you
might sit in the executive team meeting
but you're probably not being treated or
paid like one and you shouldn't be
so it's up to us it's up to us to work
on the right stuff a and so you know I I
sometimes blame the hiring managers like
the CEOs don't know what good looks like
so they don't necessarily hire the HR
leader that they need or partner with
them in the way that would be most
beneficial but it's also on us to
educate ourselves to find our resources
and our mentors and I know Kelly mentors
people and you know listening to HR
Heretics is a great way to ramp up in
terms of what good looks like but figure
out what good looks like and get there
and and then you'll earn The credibility
and the pay and the title and the
influence that that comes with being a
broad-based business executive so that
that's a bunch of walk back Nolan on a
spicy headline that I I still believe in
um but it's for for I I think reasonable
reasons I you know just to further that
point executives are an N of one market
LJ actually said this in the coinbase
episode and I've been thinking a lot
about it and I think
the intent of driving pay parity amongst
Executives is is well intended um but I
don't think that that level of quote
unquote like fairness actually makes any
sense because you know you could think
of like a cro for example who's
literally in charge of driving the
revenue for the business having uh an On
Target earning that's much higher than
anyone else
at the exec level like it makes total
sense it's it's aligned um you can
imagine a CFO who is in very high demand
uh for that that type of business that
has more Equity than anyone else it's
just I think execs are an N of one
market and I think there are cases in
which like um the desire to have pay
parity clouds the business reality of
what it takes to work with the best
people for the job
agreed there might be a scenario where
your people or HR leader is the top PID
maybe you're maybe you're a B2B SAS
company that's selling to HR Executives
you probably want some super heavyweight
well-known esteemed leader that is
wearing multiple hats both you know
leading your people function advising a
CEO and you're you know has a big part
of your go to market and product um as
well even if they don't report in lots
of
influence um but it depends on the role
yeah the range is is extremely wide I
mean this range is 300K plus or minus
total cash comp a year that range not
the range way high yeah yeah it could
even be bigger um depending on the stage
of the company and and again it's by the
role like when you think about these in
like it's I think LJ just nailed it is
like each executive is n of one like
they have all these people have their
own markets and this is where I think
Netflix nailed it and they they take a
lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for not having pay parity
but the reality is is when you get to
like that upper upper echelon level like
your your Market is determined by your
own Market not the rest of the market uh
and I'll go back to the um uh the
Charlie Munger quote around executive
compensation one of the things Munger
said was like I'd rather throw a Viper
down my shirt than bring in a comp
consultant
and I think this is why is like you know
it's there's so much Nuance with each
individual person that um you know as it
relates to pay parody here I don't think
it actually exist at that level I I
don't know I would take issue with
Charlie's take there like having been a
comp consultant having worked with comp
Consultants let's talk about well hey Le
let's add like just a bit of nuance to
that um we've talked about the
relationship between an investor and a
founder and it's really disruptive to
displace a founder or you piss off a
founder and so it's helpful sometimes to
have a third party disinterested
professional to come in and help figure
out how somebody should be paid right so
even if they're not coming up with some
new answer um just removing the tension
or reducing the tension from that
Dynamic can be worth whatever you're
paying that uh that consultant and I I
think about that in in any range of the
scenarios from public company to you
startup as well as peack um that the the
relationship Dynamics and the power
dynamics really matter and sometime
sometimes it can be helpful to have a
third party come in and and smooth it
over I also think we've talked about
this you need a little bit of structure
a little bit of you know bumper rails on
the bowling lane I mean it can't just be
individual by individual all over the
place so but we can talk about that
later or we have talked about maybe
before yeah uh Kelly anything else from
you no this is wonderful my friend thank
you Andrew for coming today thank thanks
so much for having me hopefully this is
hopefully this is useful that's the
point in my career that I'm at I just
want to be but my my number one purpose
is to try to help other HR people
Elevate I I felt for a long time for
most of my career that that HR has
been I don't know undervalued and we can
do better um and and so people leader
accelerator and the book and podcast
like this um I I hope are continuing to
elevate the function as people figure
out what good good looks like love that
Andrew thank you again for the time HR
