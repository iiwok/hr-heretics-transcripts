# Your Next Hire Might Be a Deepfake with Danielle Mathis, VP Global Talent at Clari

## Transcript

What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have Daniel Matthysse from Clary. What's
up Danielle? It's good to see you. Good
to see you too.
Okay, so we met at the Sapphire event
and you told me the craziest story that
I think I've heard this year and I've
heard a lot of crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this year. So
there's a sound bite right now in tech
around these fake candidates, right?
Like these deep fake candidates. There's
a whole lot of theories about what's
going on there. But the other thing that
I think many of us have started to feel
in other aspects is like deep fake
companies. And this happened at Clary.
So Danielle, can you tell us the story
about what happened and how you guys are
solving this problem? Sure. So again,
cautionary tale about malicious actors,
right? It's it's not fun that we're all
kind of navigating this, but we're
navigating it together. And I definitely
didn't expect this on an idle Tuesday
morning going to the airport, heading on
an international flight for work, but
that's the such is life. And I started
to get these pings from a few folks
internally. They were middle management
and they said, "Danielle, I got this
note that someone thinks they're joining
my team tomorrow, but I'm not hiring."
And they said, "Okay, could you send
that over to me? Just send me everything
you've got." So, they were sending
screenshots and emails. And what had
happened was is so it started off with
two individuals. It grew is is what you
will learn. But two individuals had
said, "Hey, I think I'm starting
tomorrow with you. I haven't received my
computer yet and I just didn't know what
time I should be at the office.
And so I went into
nothing gets past me. So what's
happening here mode? And I realized that
they had definitely been conned in some
way. I was trying to figure out what the
con was, so to speak. And what I had
figured out was that there was somebody
out there playing the part of being a
Clary recruiter and recruiting them into
our organization
and they had been through a little bit
of a process which I came to find out
later end to end and that they had
actually received an offer from us
letterhead signature from somebody who
our department and they thought they
were very much starting with us the
subsequent day.
Wow. Okay. So,
so these pe So you said it you said it
then grew. So like walk me through you
get pinged from middle managers. You
start diving in and you're like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
someone has been acting on our behalf
that is not us
purporting to be us. Telling potential
candidates like running them through a
recruiting cycle presumably. Oh yeah.
extending an offer, telling them they're
going to join, and then they're reaching
out to you being like, "Hey, like what's
going on here?" Like things feel a
little bit disorganized. So then like
what are you doing there? What's going
on? Yeah, it was a good question. My
first reaction was okay, how big is
this? So I went and just checked my
LinkedIn, which then I found two more
people who had reached out and then I
went and actually had gotten a ping from
one of my recruiters. So in Slack, had
found out two more people. So at this
point we had like a total of six or
eight people over the course. This is
over probably a 48 hour course. In that
time my first reaction was I need to get
in touch with legal to just find out
like hey have you heard of this before?
I hadn't necessarily heard of it before.
I mean I had heard of it but I had never
experienced it I guess. So, I actually
wanted to reach out to the individuals
to find out like more and see if I could
find a throughine who was behind said
operation. And I did start to see a
pattern. I had got some contact
information, some screenshots. Everybody
was so great. My first thought was I
wanted to help these individuals because
they were obviously in a very vulnerable
place. They were earlier in career. So
to them, what would seem abnormal to me
about a recruiting process wouldn't
necessarily feel abnormal to them. Hey,
you're an incoming designer. You're new
in career. Let me see your portfolio.
Oh, your portfolio looks so great. I'm
going to send this over to the the
hiring manager. Yep, they said this
looks great and they'd love to have you
do X exercise. They do the exercise,
they get it back. So there there's an
interaction there. They hadn't
necessarily met face to face. those
kinds of pieces were obviously missing,
but they didn't pick up on it. So, I
just I felt really bad for these folks.
And I wanted to protect the brands, too.
And and I didn't want to just throw up
my hands and go, "Not my, you know, or
here legal, go deal." I wanted to really
like get in there. And so, I jumped on
the call with all of them. I talked to
each one of them. I wanted to get a
recanting of what happened just cuz I
figured that was going to help in any
scenario. And it did.
And I kind of said like, "Hold on, sit
tight." I mean, some of these people had
quit their jobs. Some of them were just
starting out and they thought this was
their first job.
So, it was just
it it was yucky all the way around for
them, for me, for Clary, for the world.
Like, you're kind of going like, "Oh,
man." You know? Yeah. This is the state
of affairs. Like, this is not what we
have to deal with. Okay. How many people
were impacted?
There were 12 in total. 12. 12 in total.
Yeah. Okay. Wow. There's actually a lot
to get into because so 12 people, you
talk to all of them. You start to find
this through line, right? Tell me about
how you handled these these people who
were impacted. Then tell me how you
think about like like why did they do
this? And then also like mitigation like
because it's clearly like there's a
problem here. People are representing
you. How are you thinking about this
stuff? Yeah. So the first thing I did
when I talked to them was got a
recanting. I told them all kind of hang
tight. And this actually came in two
different waves. So the first wave was
eight and then there was an additional
four subsequent. So I kind of had a
playbook at that point on what I was
going to go and run and do. And so it
made the the time a lot faster. But the
first time around after talking to them,
I immediately thought to myself, okay,
so so did we, you know, I was trying to
give them a little bit of a lesson in
that, hey, so if you're not interacting
with somebody who, for example, has an
atclary email that that that could
probably be fraudulent, right? and and
you're early in career so you don't
necessarily know but you're always going
to have by and large a face this is
before we were you know AI was where AI
is now but I said you're always going to
have a conversation with a person
generally at some point in the interview
process
and was kind of using that but I was
also tempering that with like hey
they're in a really you know terrible
mindset they just got told like hey
actually don't have a job tomorrow
and then I also started to think about,
hey, could we capitalize on this in some
way? Like, let let me look at their
backgrounds. Like, maybe we have a role
for them. There were actually two
engineers earlier in career and we
happen to have some early in career
roles open at that time. So, I said
immediately, hey, I'm going to send this
to my team. I'm going to get you on the
phone with somebody. Let's go ahead and
see how that goes. Right. And we
actually ended up hiring one of them.
That's wild. Wow. So the fraudsters are
actually pretty good recruiters it turns
out. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Sai, you know
it's his name. Yeah. Okay. So, so one
gets hired and then what do you do with
these 11 other people? Yeah, it was
tricky. What I did do was because I
obviously have a fabulous relationship
with a lot of agencies was I put them in
touch with some care some some agencies
that were helpful for earlier in career
and and some of them I just said hey
look if there's any way that my team can
help you with your resume or give you
some you know kind of career coaching
and those kinds of things being earlier
in career so that also I think helped
put them you know at ease. Okay. So,
what is the motive? Like why are people
doing this? Like like I I don't even
understand like what would you get from
deceiving somebody of this nature? Like
what is a fraudster trying to to what
information are they gathering? Like
what's the purpose? What do they get out
of this? So, it's really interesting. It
took me a little while to figure it out,
but the reality is they're trying to get
people's W2 information so they can go
and sell it or do whatever with it,
right? Definitely
malice. We know that.
So like on a W2,
you have, you know, name, social
security number,
but like not even bank account
information, right? like but I think
dark web like who knows what they're
doing with that. All I know is that it
was clear to me this person was
definitely trying to gather
sensitive information to be able to
profit in some way. I definitely know
they were not geographically here in the
United States. So that was tricky, too.
And when I got on the phone with legal,
I was like, "What do we do with this?"
Right. And he's like, "We contact the
FBI." Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Here we go.
So, I've done that once.
We had a crazy situation in which an
employee was sending photos of guns to
other employees.
And this was Memorial Day weekend. I'll
never forget like I like Friday Memorial
Day weekend. Like I sit down on my couch
like like finally like 3 days just going
to like chill like go get some sun and I
get this this picture which is like and
by the way the with the guns it said
blood everywhere which is like
definitely not like how you think about
an employee Slack message about to
arrive. So I called the FBI and for
people who haven't called the FBI my
learning was it's like a hotline. Yes.
Right. And so it's it literally said it
I like I don't remember exactly the
words, but it was something along the
lines of like for mass shootings press
one. For weapons of mass destruction,
press two. And I was like, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
is happening right now? Was that your
experience, too? Yeah. I was on with our
chief legal officer and I was like,
okay, is this is this how this always
goes? Because I just couldn't believe
it. It's like, did they call you back?
They did. They started with him. They
gathered the information.
I had provided anything that the case
officer needed. We did send a cease and
desist to the information that we had on
file.
It seemed to definitely like lessen what
had happened because and I don't know
that there was a response, but
after whatever investigation they did,
they found him and they took care of
that, which was great. And we didn't
receive anybody else in in that trunch
of Yeah. of malice. The other one was
text message based. Okay.
So it was four individuals earlier in
career again, right? Super vulnerable
population. They're used to a different
way of interacting.
So it didn't feel as
out of, you know, the norm to them. So,
it didn't feel out of the norm to them
to get a interaction like that, a text
message about a potential job and an
opportunity. Again, this is a Clary
recruiter, very much not a clary
recruiter. And so, they didn't get to
the point of actually receiving an
offer, which was great. Those four
people
reached out to us saying like, "Hey, I
haven't received the offer yet. I'm
being told I'm going to receive the
offer."
And similar story though, one reached
out to our LinkedIn account, one reached
out to my LinkedIn account, and two sent
notes to I believe people on my
recruiting team, two of my recruiters.
And so I went through the same thing.
And there was a through line and a
number and a phone number I found
through like digging and doing all of
the different things. So they handled it
in the same way.
So then I felt like I was in the
Twilight Zone like this is is this going
to continue to happen like you know and
I'm putting it in in different forums
I'm in right to go like hey guys are you
experiencing this too somewhere really I
so you were the first when we talked
about this at the Sapphire event you
were the first person I've ever heard
gone through this then I leave that
event probably three weeks later I'm an
LP in a very like very small LP in a VC
fund and they do capital calls like a
couple times a year so you just like,
you know, kind of wired them information
and somebody had bought a domain,
added one letter to the domain, used the
exact same email that the finance guy
sends, and I was like about to click it,
and then I had received an email from
the VC firm saying like, "Do not click
this link. Like, we are aware there's a
fishing attempt." And so it just seems
like now it is happening more frequently
with potentially like higher malicious
intent. And you know, in the era of AI,
it's I think it's going to get even
crazier. Hey everyone, we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talent at Signal Fire,
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metiv is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions, and talent leaders can
finally take control of the interview
process. Metiv covers all your
compliance needs, works with all your
existing tools, and takes less than 3
minutes to set up. Join talent leaders
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora, and check out
MeteView. Head over to
metave.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up running and AI enabled in minutes.
Okay. So, other people are experiencing
it. Did you call the FBI again? Yes. I
mean, I immediately was like, "So, let's
call the the the hotline number, right?"
Like, I don't Yeah,
I think it was a it was a whole
different sort of thing they were
dealing with. It wasn't the same
individual, so to speak. And then we
haven't received anything since. So, I'm
knocking on all the wood that we have to
go through that again. But I did the
same thing, right? I went back. I wanted
to make sure that those people were okay
and that they,
you know, look, do we have anything? Can
I put them in touch? I mean, the one
individual who was actually there were
two individuals in design. I didn't have
anything at the time and but I did put
them in touch with our our our chief
designer, right, to go ahead and just
get some learnings there. Like, what
could I at least help him out? Like
that's just I think about the parents,
right, who think their kids getting
their first job and joining this great
SAS company and and all of that. Like it
I I you know put on a lot of different
hats in that moment and I just couldn't
help but be like how can I help? So how
do you think about mitigation then
moving forward, right? like there isn't
really a whole lot you can do to defend
against this especially because this is
not like your database. You know, it's
like one thing if it's like people in
your ATS, right, or former employees,
right? We can email all those people and
say, "Hey, be on the lookout for this."
But these are malicious actors going to
total strangers to Clary, acting like
they are Clary and then deceiving them
in such a way to where it's like then
they're gathering whatever whatever
reason they want the W2. So what are you
doing to defend against it? It's a good
question. So immediately I went to our
security our CS our CISO, right? Like
what do we do?
And we obviously added a lot of, you
know, warning and verbiage to our job
descriptions, our careers page. We
actually have a whole fraudulent
page on the website for folks that feel
like if even if they had any questions
surrounding the validity of like they
needed to get in touch with us. So it
goes to myself, it goes to our head of
legal and our CISO. So that way we all
have visibility and can course correct
if needed. Thankfully, we haven't had to
use it, but it's there. Wow. And so,
since that, you said you've also
experienced other companies that are
having similar issues. And then today,
right before we jumped on the pod, you
said that you had also experienced one
of these defake candidates that appears
to be now everyone's experiencing that.
It's been funny. We nobody I think not
that we couldn't have predicted the AI
transformation. It's, you know, it's
been moving and then it's kind of here,
right? and what do you do with it? And
it's all happening so fast. And and so
we're sitting in these seats, these
these really pivotal time for all of us
in these seats to
collectively be navigating the AI
transformation and the deep fake thing.
It was probably about a year ago, one of
my recruiters called me and was like,
"Hey, Danielle, I just experienced
something super odd, but I I think I
think there was a phone farm call." And
I was like, "Let's go on. let's talk
about that. And so it was something that
I've had my eye on for quite some time.
And
and and then at first it was only really
hitting us here in the US and then now,
you know, I have teams in in Poland and
in India and the UK and they're all
reporting to me things that they're
seeing. And so I said, you know, let me
let me go ahead and I'd love to
experience it myself. And so there was a
candidate that applied stereotypical
like couldn't have been a more perfect
candidate on paper.
John Doe. And so I said, "Okay, well,
I'll take the call. Just throw it on my
calendar." And so I got on Zoom this
morning and, you know, very much
delayed,
would not answer questions that I was
asking in the way I wanted them asked or
answered. Also very
robotic- like. I mean, it was just a
very stereotypical transaction, but it
was good for me to sort of see it
firsthand as well. And now we're having
to put, you know, a lot more in place.
And we we've been doing that as we've
navigated this, you know, this new
chapter. What are you guys putting in
place? Because I I think about this a
lot, too. If I was still leading people
or recruiting teams, it kind of feels
like
we don't have a playbook here, right?
So, everyone's just kind of inventing it
as we go along. And you know, I think
these tactics are going to improve
dramatically over the course like I
think in the next few months, right?
Some of the stuff we're seeing right now
is going to be, you know, it's going to
look like 1947 TV compared to like what
we're going to see in the next couple of
months. And so, like, are you guys
regularly talking about this? Like, what
what things are you doing? Yep. So,
we're doing the hand test. If there's
anything if we get on Zoom, first of
all, all cameras on all the time.
There's no more good oldfashioned phone
call.
Wow.
 
what side of the business. And the
recruiters are like, actually, it's so
helpful because they're pretty, you
know, I have amazing an amazing talent
team and they're all vets and they, you
know, they have they have
been able to figure out very early on.
There's only there's only one or two
here that that get through now. at the
beginning, right? They were like, "Wow,
I I'm finding all these really great
candidates." But then I get on and I'm
realizing they aren't who they say they
are, right? Talk a year ago,
but now as a candidate comes through, if
they're too good to be true, we're cross
referencing LinkedIn, right? Oh, they
only have two people on their LinkedIn
or they don't have, you know, their
prof,
right? And then on Zoom, hand test,
we're really transparent about it. Hey,
look, deep fakes are out there. So, it's
like deep fakes are out there. Can I
like see your hand? it like this. Oh, in
front of your face. Got it. Yep. And if
they had like a funky background, it
would you would be able to tell. You'd
be able to see it. So, the hand test has
been really helpful for us. And, you
know, it's it's an unfortunate truth,
but that's where we're at. And it's it's
getting to the point, too, where I'm
seeing a lot of people say like, "We're
not even looking at inbound. We're only
looking externally because this is
becoming so pervasive." And
that's not my philosophy, but I
understand why people are taking that
approach. I Okay, so I was just going to
ask you about how you're thinking about
the fake candidate problem now with with
inbounds. So, you know, I think there's
a false narrative out there that the
applicant tracking systems have this
amazing AI and they can just like
surface the best candidates. And in
reality, my experience has always been
it's kind of like chronological order.
We have to sift through to find the
needle in the hay stack already. That's
pretty low ROI, but we do it because
these people are expressing interest
into us. Like that's awesome. We want
that. So, what are you doing? How are
you thinking about that? Because there
is some value in there if you can find
it. Well, here's the difference to me
and this is what I think people aren't
aren't aren't realizing. We're be we're
going from content creators to editors,
right? like in a lot of ways and part of
that process is I don't think it's
entirely equitable to have anybody be
floating anybody the top of anything
right you should be able to go ahead and
really be able to look at a background
and and know okay the time that this
person was at Cisco was a really
you know it was a hyperrowth time so
their background is very different than
somebody who was at Cisco from a time
where they were in an ivory tower role
right so to speak as a leader So my
recruiting team is going to be able to
look at that with that knowledge because
they are SMEES in subject matter experts
in their area of the business that they
would know that. So therefore they can
read a different story
and so for that reason alone yeah you go
through the inbound I will tell you
about 20% of our candidates 25 really
are inbound of your hires of our hires.
Yeah that's that's an amazing number.
Yeah, it there is a value there and I I
I just call me a contrarian, but like
I'll talk about that all day. Totally.
But like but I mean that's a lot of
work. Are you guys adding then friction
to reduce the amount of workload? So
like I was talking to a company about
this the other day. This is like a
series A company. You have not heard of
them. Like I would say nobody who
listens to the show has heard of them
and they're getting flooded with inbound
one. you know, one piece of it is
garbage, another piece of it is fake,
and then a very small sliver are
candidates they would like to talk to.
And the CEO was like, "How do I solve
this problem?" I was like, "Well, if it
were me, if I think about an inbound
candidate, right, they're expressing
interest in us." And so, in that world,
we have a right to potentially ask for
something before we jump on the phone
with them. So, like, you know, write a
 
you and why you want to work here,
right? something like very easy that's
not going to be too burdensome but that
like makes somebody clear an extra
hurdle that isn't just total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
So what are you guys doing there? It's a
good question. On the engineering side
we are doing a lot of that. That's
that's you know kind of a a checkbox for
us that's worked very very well. On our
GTM side one thing we've really done is
okay so for example we get a lot
obviously from LinkedIn. We have a ton
of questions they have to answer. Like
if you're not willing to sit there and
answer the questions and you think it's
just like oh do I apply to the you know
am I have I worked for in sales for five
years yeah and that's it and you're
going to pass. Nope. So we've done a lot
of that. The other thing that's been
really amazing is we use Coderpad for
our testing tool and I just am a huge
fan and call me a fan girl, but I will
say that they have a lot of new amazing
tools that have been helpful for us on
the AI front both to be able to navigate
what good looks like, right? So
we have we are right now actually
revamping our our whole
interview
panels and everything for our
engineering side to really make sure
that what we're doing is showing that we
too are you know we're we're actually
adopting this and using this not let's
scared of it and look at it as a tool
that tells us if you're cheating or not
right but we're doing some of those
things early on in the process so it
weeds everything out earlier. Yep. I
think it's the only solve. Like it's
it's crazy. And I do think I've I've
evolved my thinking on this. Seven,
eight months ago, I was like, "Oh,
whatever." Like, you know, the hand
test, like there's stuff like that.
Like, we'll get over it. You get on
Zooms. But just given the sophistication
and what's going on, I feel like we're
entering the era where we probably do
need more software tools to help
ultimately solve these problems, which
is so obnoxious and annoying that this
is where we are in the world today.
Nolan, I'm calling it job security. You
know, that's a good point. Yeah,
especially in the era of AI. I love it.
Daniel, where can people find you? You
know, you can find me on LinkedIn. I am
always datcl.com
if you're ever trying to get in touch.
Sick. Thanks so much for the time.
Appreciate you. I'm dude. HR Heretics is
