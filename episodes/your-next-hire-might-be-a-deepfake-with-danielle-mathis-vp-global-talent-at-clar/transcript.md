morning going to the airport, heading on
 
morning going to the airport, heading on
an international flight for work, but
 
an international flight for work, but
that's the such is life. And I started

internally. They were middle management
 
internally. They were middle management

going on here?" Like things feel a
little bit disorganized. So then like
 
little bit disorganized. So then like
what are you doing there? What's going
 
what are you doing there? What's going
on? Yeah, it was a good question. My
 
on? Yeah, it was a good question. My
first reaction was okay, how big is
 
first reaction was okay, how big is
this? So I went and just checked my
 
this? So I went and just checked my
LinkedIn, which then I found two more
 
LinkedIn, which then I found two more
people who had reached out and then I
 
people who had reached out and then I
went and actually had gotten a ping from
 
went and actually had gotten a ping from
one of my recruiters. So in Slack, had
 
one of my recruiters. So in Slack, had
found out two more people. So at this
 
found out two more people. So at this
point we had like a total of six or
 
point we had like a total of six or
eight people over the course. This is
 
eight people over the course. This is
over probably a 48 hour course. In that
 
over probably a 48 hour course. In that
time my first reaction was I need to get
 
time my first reaction was I need to get
in touch with legal to just find out
 
in touch with legal to just find out
like hey have you heard of this before?
 
like hey have you heard of this before?
I hadn't necessarily heard of it before.
 
I hadn't necessarily heard of it before.
I mean I had heard of it but I had never
 
I mean I had heard of it but I had never
experienced it I guess. So, I actually
 
experienced it I guess. So, I actually
wanted to reach out to the individuals
 
wanted to reach out to the individuals
to find out like more and see if I could
 
to find out like more and see if I could
find a throughine who was behind said
 
find a throughine who was behind said
operation. And I did start to see a
 
operation. And I did start to see a
pattern. I had got some contact
 
pattern. I had got some contact
information, some screenshots. Everybody
 
information, some screenshots. Everybody
was so great. My first thought was I
 
was so great. My first thought was I
wanted to help these individuals because
 
wanted to help these individuals because
they were obviously in a very vulnerable
 
they were obviously in a very vulnerable
place. They were earlier in career. So
 
place. They were earlier in career. So
to them, what would seem abnormal to me
 
to them, what would seem abnormal to me
about a recruiting process wouldn't
 
about a recruiting process wouldn't
necessarily feel abnormal to them. Hey,
 
necessarily feel abnormal to them. Hey,
you're an incoming designer. You're new
 
you're an incoming designer. You're new
in career. Let me see your portfolio.
 
in career. Let me see your portfolio.
Oh, your portfolio looks so great. I'm
 
Oh, your portfolio looks so great. I'm
going to send this over to the the
 
going to send this over to the the
hiring manager. Yep, they said this
 
hiring manager. Yep, they said this
looks great and they'd love to have you
 
looks great and they'd love to have you
do X exercise. They do the exercise,
 
do X exercise. They do the exercise,
they get it back. So there there's an
 
they get it back. So there there's an
interaction there. They hadn't
 
interaction there. They hadn't
necessarily met face to face. those
 
necessarily met face to face. those
kinds of pieces were obviously missing,
 
kinds of pieces were obviously missing,
but they didn't pick up on it. So, I
 
but they didn't pick up on it. So, I
just I felt really bad for these folks.
 
just I felt really bad for these folks.
And I wanted to protect the brands, too.
 
And I wanted to protect the brands, too.
And and I didn't want to just throw up
 
And and I didn't want to just throw up
my hands and go, "Not my, you know, or
 
my hands and go, "Not my, you know, or
here legal, go deal." I wanted to really
 
here legal, go deal." I wanted to really
like get in there. And so, I jumped on
 
like get in there. And so, I jumped on
the call with all of them. I talked to
 
the call with all of them. I talked to
each one of them. I wanted to get a
 
each one of them. I wanted to get a
recanting of what happened just cuz I
 
recanting of what happened just cuz I
figured that was going to help in any
 
figured that was going to help in any
scenario. And it did.
 
scenario. And it did.
And I kind of said like, "Hold on, sit
 
And I kind of said like, "Hold on, sit
tight." I mean, some of these people had
 
tight." I mean, some of these people had
quit their jobs. Some of them were just
 
quit their jobs. Some of them were just
starting out and they thought this was
 
starting out and they thought this was
their first job.
 
their first job.
So, it was just
 
So, it was just
it it was yucky all the way around for
 
it it was yucky all the way around for
them, for me, for Clary, for the world.
 
them, for me, for Clary, for the world.
Like, you're kind of going like, "Oh,
 
Like, you're kind of going like, "Oh,

man." You know? Yeah. This is the state
of affairs. Like, this is not what we
 
of affairs. Like, this is not what we
have to deal with. Okay. How many people
 
have to deal with. Okay. How many people
were impacted?
 
were impacted?
There were 12 in total. 12. 12 in total.
 
There were 12 in total. 12. 12 in total.
Yeah. Okay. Wow. There's actually a lot
 
Yeah. Okay. Wow. There's actually a lot
to get into because so 12 people, you
 
to get into because so 12 people, you
talk to all of them. You start to find
 
talk to all of them. You start to find
this through line, right? Tell me about
 
this through line, right? Tell me about
how you handled these these people who
 
how you handled these these people who
were impacted. Then tell me how you
 
were impacted. Then tell me how you
think about like like why did they do
 
think about like like why did they do
this? And then also like mitigation like
 
this? And then also like mitigation like
because it's clearly like there's a
 
because it's clearly like there's a
problem here. People are representing
 
problem here. People are representing
you. How are you thinking about this
 
you. How are you thinking about this
stuff? Yeah. So the first thing I did
 
stuff? Yeah. So the first thing I did
when I talked to them was got a
 
when I talked to them was got a
recanting. I told them all kind of hang
 
recanting. I told them all kind of hang
tight. And this actually came in two
 
tight. And this actually came in two
different waves. So the first wave was
 
different waves. So the first wave was
eight and then there was an additional
 
eight and then there was an additional
four subsequent. So I kind of had a
 
four subsequent. So I kind of had a
playbook at that point on what I was
 
playbook at that point on what I was
going to go and run and do. And so it
 
going to go and run and do. And so it
made the the time a lot faster. But the
 
made the the time a lot faster. But the
first time around after talking to them,
 
first time around after talking to them,
I immediately thought to myself, okay,
 
I immediately thought to myself, okay,
so so did we, you know, I was trying to
 
so so did we, you know, I was trying to
give them a little bit of a lesson in
 
give them a little bit of a lesson in
that, hey, so if you're not interacting
 
that, hey, so if you're not interacting
with somebody who, for example, has an
 
with somebody who, for example, has an
atclary email that that that could
 
atclary email that that that could
probably be fraudulent, right? and and
 
probably be fraudulent, right? and and
you're early in career so you don't
 
you're early in career so you don't
necessarily know but you're always going
 
necessarily know but you're always going
to have by and large a face this is
 
to have by and large a face this is
before we were you know AI was where AI
 
before we were you know AI was where AI
is now but I said you're always going to
 
is now but I said you're always going to
have a conversation with a person
 
have a conversation with a person
generally at some point in the interview
 
generally at some point in the interview
process
 
process
and was kind of using that but I was
 
and was kind of using that but I was
also tempering that with like hey
 
also tempering that with like hey
they're in a really you know terrible
 
they're in a really you know terrible
mindset they just got told like hey
 
mindset they just got told like hey
actually don't have a job tomorrow
 
actually don't have a job tomorrow
and then I also started to think about,
 
and then I also started to think about,
hey, could we capitalize on this in some
 
hey, could we capitalize on this in some
way? Like, let let me look at their
 
way? Like, let let me look at their
backgrounds. Like, maybe we have a role
 
backgrounds. Like, maybe we have a role
for them. There were actually two
 
for them. There were actually two
engineers earlier in career and we
 
engineers earlier in career and we
happen to have some early in career
 
happen to have some early in career
roles open at that time. So, I said
 
roles open at that time. So, I said

to my team. I'm going to get you on the
 
to my team. I'm going to get you on the

what's the purpose? What do they get out
of this? So, it's really interesting. It
 
of this? So, it's really interesting. It
took me a little while to figure it out,
 
took me a little while to figure it out,
but the reality is they're trying to get
 
but the reality is they're trying to get
people's W2 information so they can go
 
people's W2 information so they can go

people who haven't called the FBI my
 
people who haven't called the FBI my
learning was it's like a hotline. Yes.
 
learning was it's like a hotline. Yes.
Right. And so it's it literally said it
 
Right. And so it's it literally said it
I like I don't remember exactly the
 
I like I don't remember exactly the
words, but it was something along the
 
words, but it was something along the
lines of like for mass shootings press
 
lines of like for mass shootings press
one. For weapons of mass destruction,
 
one. For weapons of mass destruction,
press two. And I was like, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

okay, is this is this how this always
goes? Because I just couldn't believe
 
goes? Because I just couldn't believe
it. It's like, did they call you back?
 
it. It's like, did they call you back?
They did. They started with him. They
 
They did. They started with him. They
gathered the information.

I had provided anything that the case
officer needed. We did send a cease and
 
officer needed. We did send a cease and
desist to the information that we had on
 
desist to the information that we had on
file.
 
file.
It seemed to definitely like lessen what
 
It seemed to definitely like lessen what
had happened because and I don't know
 
had happened because and I don't know
that there was a response, but
 
that there was a response, but
after whatever investigation they did,
 
after whatever investigation they did,
they found him and they took care of
 
they found him and they took care of
that, which was great. And we didn't
 
that, which was great. And we didn't
receive anybody else in in that trunch
 
receive anybody else in in that trunch
of Yeah. of malice. The other one was
 
of Yeah. of malice. The other one was
text message based. Okay.
 
text message based. Okay.
So it was four individuals earlier in
 
So it was four individuals earlier in
career again, right? Super vulnerable
 
career again, right? Super vulnerable
population. They're used to a different
 
population. They're used to a different
way of interacting.
 
way of interacting.
So it didn't feel as
 
So it didn't feel as
out of, you know, the norm to them. So,
 
out of, you know, the norm to them. So,
it didn't feel out of the norm to them
 
it didn't feel out of the norm to them
to get a interaction like that, a text
 
to get a interaction like that, a text
message about a potential job and an
 
message about a potential job and an
opportunity. Again, this is a Clary
 
opportunity. Again, this is a Clary
recruiter, very much not a clary
 
recruiter, very much not a clary
recruiter. And so, they didn't get to
 
recruiter. And so, they didn't get to
the point of actually receiving an
 
the point of actually receiving an
offer, which was great. Those four
 
offer, which was great. Those four
people
 
people
reached out to us saying like, "Hey, I
 
reached out to us saying like, "Hey, I
haven't received the offer yet. I'm
 
haven't received the offer yet. I'm
being told I'm going to receive the
 
being told I'm going to receive the
offer."
 
offer."

number and a phone number I found
 
number and a phone number I found
through like digging and doing all of
 
through like digging and doing all of
the different things. So they handled it

something super odd, but I I think I
 
something super odd, but I I think I

And
 
And
and and then at first it was only really
 
and and then at first it was only really
hitting us here in the US and then now,
 
hitting us here in the US and then now,
you know, I have teams in in Poland and
 
you know, I have teams in in Poland and
in India and the UK and they're all
 
in India and the UK and they're all
reporting to me things that they're
 
reporting to me things that they're
seeing. And so I said, you know, let me
 
seeing. And so I said, you know, let me
let me go ahead and I'd love to
 
let me go ahead and I'd love to
experience it myself. And so there was a
 
experience it myself. And so there was a
candidate that applied stereotypical

I'll take the call. Just throw it on my
 
I'll take the call. Just throw it on my

delayed,
would not answer questions that I was
 
would not answer questions that I was
asking in the way I wanted them asked or
 
asking in the way I wanted them asked or
answered. Also very
 
answered. Also very
robotic- like. I mean, it was just a
 
robotic- like. I mean, it was just a
very stereotypical transaction, but it
 
very stereotypical transaction, but it
was good for me to sort of see it
 
was good for me to sort of see it
firsthand as well. And now we're having
 
firsthand as well. And now we're having
to put, you know, a lot more in place.
 
to put, you know, a lot more in place.
And we we've been doing that as we've
 
And we we've been doing that as we've
navigated this, you know, this new
 
navigated this, you know, this new
chapter. What are you guys putting in
 
chapter. What are you guys putting in
place? Because I I think about this a
 
place? Because I I think about this a
lot, too. If I was still leading people
 
lot, too. If I was still leading people
or recruiting teams, it kind of feels
 
or recruiting teams, it kind of feels
like
 
like
we don't have a playbook here, right?
 
we don't have a playbook here, right?
So, everyone's just kind of inventing it
 
So, everyone's just kind of inventing it
as we go along. And you know, I think
 
as we go along. And you know, I think
these tactics are going to improve
 
these tactics are going to improve
dramatically over the course like I
 
dramatically over the course like I
think in the next few months, right?
 
think in the next few months, right?
Some of the stuff we're seeing right now
 
Some of the stuff we're seeing right now
is going to be, you know, it's going to
 
is going to be, you know, it's going to
look like 1947 TV compared to like what
 
look like 1947 TV compared to like what
we're going to see in the next couple of
 
we're going to see in the next couple of
months. And so, like, are you guys
 
months. And so, like, are you guys
regularly talking about this? Like, what
 
regularly talking about this? Like, what
what things are you doing? Yep. So,
 
what things are you doing? Yep. So,
we're doing the hand test. If there's
 
we're doing the hand test. If there's
anything if we get on Zoom, first of

There's only there's only one or two
 
There's only there's only one or two
here that that get through now. at the
 
here that that get through now. at the
beginning, right? They were like, "Wow,
 
beginning, right? They were like, "Wow,
I I'm finding all these really great
 
I I'm finding all these really great
candidates." But then I get on and I'm
 
candidates." But then I get on and I'm
realizing they aren't who they say they
 
realizing they aren't who they say they
are, right? Talk a year ago,
 
are, right? Talk a year ago,
but now as a candidate comes through, if
 
but now as a candidate comes through, if
they're too good to be true, we're cross
 
they're too good to be true, we're cross
referencing LinkedIn, right? Oh, they
 
referencing LinkedIn, right? Oh, they
only have two people on their LinkedIn
 
only have two people on their LinkedIn
or they don't have, you know, their
 
or they don't have, you know, their
prof,
 
prof,
right? And then on Zoom, hand test,
 
right? And then on Zoom, hand test,
we're really transparent about it. Hey,
 
we're really transparent about it. Hey,
look, deep fakes are out there. So, it's
 
look, deep fakes are out there. So, it's
like deep fakes are out there. Can I
 
like deep fakes are out there. Can I
like see your hand? it like this. Oh, in
 
like see your hand? it like this. Oh, in
front of your face. Got it. Yep. And if
 
front of your face. Got it. Yep. And if
they had like a funky background, it
 
they had like a funky background, it
would you would be able to tell. You'd
 
would you would be able to tell. You'd
be able to see it. So, the hand test has
 
be able to see it. So, the hand test has
been really helpful for us. And, you
 
been really helpful for us. And, you
know, it's it's an unfortunate truth,
 
know, it's it's an unfortunate truth,
but that's where we're at. And it's it's
 
but that's where we're at. And it's it's
getting to the point, too, where I'm
 
getting to the point, too, where I'm
seeing a lot of people say like, "We're
 
seeing a lot of people say like, "We're
not even looking at inbound. We're only
 
not even looking at inbound. We're only
looking externally because this is
 
looking externally because this is
becoming so pervasive." And
 
becoming so pervasive." And
that's not my philosophy, but I
 
that's not my philosophy, but I
understand why people are taking that
 
understand why people are taking that
approach. I Okay, so I was just going to
 
approach. I Okay, so I was just going to
ask you about how you're thinking about
 
ask you about how you're thinking about
the fake candidate problem now with with
 
the fake candidate problem now with with
inbounds. So, you know, I think there's
 
inbounds. So, you know, I think there's
a false narrative out there that the
 
a false narrative out there that the
applicant tracking systems have this
 
applicant tracking systems have this
amazing AI and they can just like
 
amazing AI and they can just like
surface the best candidates. And in
 
surface the best candidates. And in
reality, my experience has always been
 
reality, my experience has always been
it's kind of like chronological order.
 
it's kind of like chronological order.
We have to sift through to find the
 
We have to sift through to find the
needle in the hay stack already. That's
 
needle in the hay stack already. That's
pretty low ROI, but we do it because
 
pretty low ROI, but we do it because
these people are expressing interest
 
these people are expressing interest
into us. Like that's awesome. We want
 
into us. Like that's awesome. We want
that. So, what are you doing? How are
 
that. So, what are you doing? How are
you thinking about that? Because there
 
you thinking about that? Because there
is some value in there if you can find
 
is some value in there if you can find
it. Well, here's the difference to me
 
it. Well, here's the difference to me
and this is what I think people aren't
 
and this is what I think people aren't
aren't aren't realizing. We're be we're
 
aren't aren't realizing. We're be we're
going from content creators to editors,
 
going from content creators to editors,
right? like in a lot of ways and part of
 
right? like in a lot of ways and part of
that process is I don't think it's
 
that process is I don't think it's
entirely equitable to have anybody be
 
entirely equitable to have anybody be
floating anybody the top of anything
 
floating anybody the top of anything
right you should be able to go ahead and
 
right you should be able to go ahead and
really be able to look at a background
 
really be able to look at a background
and and know okay the time that this
 
and and know okay the time that this
person was at Cisco was a really
 
person was at Cisco was a really
you know it was a hyperrowth time so
 
you know it was a hyperrowth time so
their background is very different than
 
their background is very different than
somebody who was at Cisco from a time
 
somebody who was at Cisco from a time
where they were in an ivory tower role
 
where they were in an ivory tower role
right so to speak as a leader So my
 
right so to speak as a leader So my
recruiting team is going to be able to
 
recruiting team is going to be able to
look at that with that knowledge because
 
look at that with that knowledge because
they are SMEES in subject matter experts
 
they are SMEES in subject matter experts
in their area of the business that they
 
in their area of the business that they
would know that. So therefore they can
 
would know that. So therefore they can
read a different story
 
read a different story
and so for that reason alone yeah you go
 
and so for that reason alone yeah you go
through the inbound I will tell you
 
through the inbound I will tell you
about 20% of our candidates 25 really
 
about 20% of our candidates 25 really
are inbound of your hires of our hires.
 
are inbound of your hires of our hires.
Yeah that's that's an amazing number.
 
Yeah that's that's an amazing number.
Yeah, it there is a value there and I I
 
Yeah, it there is a value there and I I
I just call me a contrarian, but like
 
I just call me a contrarian, but like
I'll talk about that all day. Totally.
 
I'll talk about that all day. Totally.
But like but I mean that's a lot of
 
But like but I mean that's a lot of
work. Are you guys adding then friction
 
work. Are you guys adding then friction
to reduce the amount of workload? So
 
to reduce the amount of workload? So
like I was talking to a company about
 
like I was talking to a company about
this the other day. This is like a
 
this the other day. This is like a
series A company. You have not heard of
 
series A company. You have not heard of
them. Like I would say nobody who
 
them. Like I would say nobody who
listens to the show has heard of them
 
listens to the show has heard of them
and they're getting flooded with inbound
 
and they're getting flooded with inbound
one. you know, one piece of it is
 
one. you know, one piece of it is
garbage, another piece of it is fake,
 
garbage, another piece of it is fake,
and then a very small sliver are
 
and then a very small sliver are
candidates they would like to talk to.
 
candidates they would like to talk to.
And the CEO was like, "How do I solve
 
And the CEO was like, "How do I solve
this problem?" I was like, "Well, if it
 
this problem?" I was like, "Well, if it
were me, if I think about an inbound
 
were me, if I think about an inbound
candidate, right, they're expressing
 
candidate, right, they're expressing
interest in us." And so, in that world,
 
interest in us." And so, in that world,
we have a right to potentially ask for
 
we have a right to potentially ask for
something before we jump on the phone
 
something before we jump on the phone
with them. So, like, you know, write a
 
with them. So, like, you know, write a
 
you and why you want to work here,
 
you and why you want to work here,
right? something like very easy that's
 
right? something like very easy that's
not going to be too burdensome but that
 
not going to be too burdensome but that
like makes somebody clear an extra
 
like makes somebody clear an extra
hurdle that isn't just total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
hurdle that isn't just total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
So what are you guys doing there? It's a
 
So what are you guys doing there? It's a
good question. On the engineering side
 
good question. On the engineering side
we are doing a lot of that. That's
 
we are doing a lot of that. That's
that's you know kind of a a checkbox for
 
that's you know kind of a a checkbox for
us that's worked very very well. On our
 
us that's worked very very well. On our
GTM side one thing we've really done is
 
GTM side one thing we've really done is
okay so for example we get a lot
 
okay so for example we get a lot
obviously from LinkedIn. We have a ton
 
obviously from LinkedIn. We have a ton
of questions they have to answer. Like
 
of questions they have to answer. Like
if you're not willing to sit there and
 
if you're not willing to sit there and
answer the questions and you think it's
 
answer the questions and you think it's
just like oh do I apply to the you know
 
just like oh do I apply to the you know
am I have I worked for in sales for five
 
am I have I worked for in sales for five
