what's up everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we have two old friends
joining our segments Colleen mccre David
Hanahan welcome back team uh our friend
Kelly dragovich is somewhere on a beach
drinking my taies or P coladas I'm I'm
unsure what her drink of choice is but
she's definitely on a beach somewhere um
so today we're going to continue the
discussion around scales and policy um
Colleen David I texted with each of you
about this topic Colleen you actually
dropped an article saying Merit needs a
Rebrand and I actually would love to
start there and talking about like what
is your take and why do you think Meritt
actually needs a Rebrand well I'll I'll
correct you a little bit and say
meritocracy in particular needs a
Rebrand I think it's that that word in
particular um and maybe it's just
because of Merit gets pulled out of of
that um some of it was certainly
inspired by the
Mei uh scale AI deciding to sort of put
a stake in the ground even creating a
whole website um around um kicking up
meritocracy again after you know it's
been uh I to some extent kind of put to
bed for a little while I felt like we
haven't actually heard that term sort of
spinning in the in the era I mean I that
was a big term back in my Microsoft days
 
know value for us and that was like 14
 
a new term at all but it's got so much
baggage um and you saw it Nolan like you
kind of like threw it out there when you
first saw it not thinking it was going
to be much of anything and then I I saw
your your post on LinkedIn and it was
like flood I mean you love a good flood
of you know lention so for you it was
great um and I just felt like it's not
you know philosophically I I don't think
it's a bad idea I mean in fact I think a
lot of us don't think the concept of
finding the person who's the most
qualified and rewarding the people who
are the most qualified for doing you
know having the highest impact I don't
know a lot people who would be opposed
to that but that word just sets people
off in in so many ways and that's where
I was like just needs a branding I mean
it's just a bad brand at this point so
maybe we should think of a better word
or a better term or a better way to go
about it um and and it could and and
then figure out a better way to do it
and I also think that you know in so in
the article that I wrote I was speaking
of this that it's not exactly
meritocracy as a philosophy we all kind
of wrap our arms around and we do agree
with the philosophy isn't bad it's the
execution that is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
hard um and it's really really hard to
get right in the sense that every
stakeholder can agree and align and
believe that it's that it's true and
that's where it seems to fall down in so
many ways or that people seem to have
and I think Kelly even spoke on this you
know at a one of your other podcasts
that like I think people have Scar
Tissue like where they they believed in
the system or they trusted that
something was going to go right or they
they believed that this was happening
and then they saw some example or they
felt like they got wronged or screwed or
and that didn't happen and then you know
so now they don't believe it anymore so
I've been trying to learn and and figure
out where people have an issue
specifically with the term meritocracy I
think there is even some people who have
an issue with the term Merit and what
I've been hearing from folks is that
it's it's hypocritical it's like we say
we do these things until the rubber
meets the road and then it feels like
rules for thee but not for me uh for the
very special people in the organization
who get to operate on their own with
impunity David is is that why
meritocracy has so many haters or what
is your take on why meritocracy comes
with the baggage that Colleen's talking
about I I think that I think that's a
lot of it um Kelly talked about the
GitHub rug and um uh why the rug uh was
was quietly brought out of the office um
and and I think when you start like hey
meritocracy is calling talking about is
an ideal or it's an ethos of like hey
isn't that a great isn't that a great
ethos but then you start breaking it
down you know like well referrals you
know we refer 30% you know 30% of our
hires are referral so someone literally
knows someone and that's how they got in
or they they they FastTrack through the
interview process does that fly in the
face of a meritocracy like you know we
we know that referrals are oftentimes
really great hires but did we cast a
wide net and this is really the best
person or hey we trust We Trust so and
so so let's hire that person obviously
there's plenty of instances as as
founding founding of uh founding stories
for companies where um we knew someone
you know we knew someone my parent uh
worked in this industry and knows a lot
of doctors or or what have you and um
you know that's that's kind of how we
got connected to investors that's how we
built our business by we knew people
versus the the founder who's in the
middle of nowhere who doesn't have those
connections and didn't get the same
level of investment so so I think
there's just so many instances where it
falls apart and so it's like yeah it's a
great great ideal but we can't say this
is us 100% like we're going to strive
for it um but we're not going to get 100
per. and I think when you write
something like Alexander did it kind of
sounds like it's unimpeachable like it's
just it's us 100% and that's why people
roll their
eyes well and let's and let's be real
I'm going to take a real live example
today do you think that bronnie James if
he wasn't LeBron James Sun would have
been drafted by the Lakers like based on
his stats coming out of USC like not
everybody's a sports person and I know
that not everybody likes using Sports
analogies but like that's that's today's
news and yep I I I got to tell you like
I would not have predicted that if I
just saw the stats of this athlete and
that school and that record I don't see
that happening for that person going to
the Lakers this year like 100% okay so
so totally agree with you I think what
I'm what I'm hearing and learning from
people is that the the issue with
meritocracy is that it's hypocritical
and selectively applied it's like for
the most part this is what we want
except for these like edge cases which
happens to be my family or my friends or
my people in some way shape or form and
I want you know the I want the back door
entry for those or I just or I just have
selective memory of these kinds of
things right like I I can very strongly
remember a CEO who thinks that he is as
the most meritocratic person around and
we were doing layoffs and when I present
the layoff list and I show him some of
the names and he's like we can't lay
that person off they're the most amazing
engineer ever and I was like they work
three years ago and now they just get
high half the day like they don't work
that hard anymore like this person
should be out you know like and so that
refresh of what have you done for me
lately you know like we we have a re
people struggle to recalibrate on a
regular basis and what's your system to
recalibrate and how how do we
reapply that idea of the what is Merit
and what is excellence and you know sort
of it's hard I mean it's just really
that's that's why I go back to the
systems and the process and the all of
these things to make sure that you're
consistently it's not just when you come
in the door and how you get in the door
it's the continued nature of how to
reapply those things and make sure that
they are appropriately being layered in
and that everybody sees it and can
appreciate it and understand how those
decisions are being made um
across the the system that you have I
think I think that's well said now I'm a
big believer in hey we should absolutely
call out the problems with the system
but we should also be thinking about
what are viable
Alternatives totally and and and this is
where like in our community and in
people leaders and HR folks I have been
searching for a viable alternative and
and I am not hearing from people what
what we should be striving for if not
meritocracy and so I guess like David
kicking this over to you what do you
think we should be striving for should
we be striving for meritocracy or should
we be striving for some other form of
excellence and
intelligence I think I'm gonna quote um
Joel and I think you both know the quote
that um but you know for the for the
listeners um Joel
upon hearing what Alexander wrote um
said that you know he writes for example
that hiring for Nei requires casting a
wi net for talent and then objectively
selecting the best without bias and any
Direction that's exactly what the most
effective Dei efforts are designed to do
so in terms of like you know are just
finding an alternative I don't I don't
know if you need to find an alternative
like you know holr I don't know like
what is a what is an alternative to to
meritocracy I think it is it's a fancier
it's just a fancier term for what we've
been for what you do for what you do in
terms of how corporations should run and
um I think it's it's it's kind of um
it's putting a bow on something that I
think many of us already believe like I
think proponents of Dei the most ENT
supporter of Dei said yes you want you
want to reward people for for their
Merit um I I asked Gemini are I asked
Gemini are meritocracy and
Dei at odds with each other and here's
how Gemini Gemini says think think of an
analogy imagine a race meritocracy
ensures everyone has the same quality
running shoes I.E skills and knowledge
Dei removes obstacles on the track I.E
unequal access to resources and provides
training for everyone I.E development
opportunities this allows everyone to
compete fairly based on their talent and
effort so um I don't think you need to
search for an alternative for Mar D
because I don't think they're that odds
with each
other I think that's I it's very fair by
the way um you're the only person I know
that uses Gemini like the rest of the
world is on chat gbt so j i we're going
to talk about this offline um we're
gonna bring you back into the rest of
the world like where is this like oh my
God we we got to get him a Lifeline um
colen do you agree with with David or do
do you think that there is potentially a
different alternative here that we
should be optimizing for I I don't think
it's I don't think David's wrong I mean
I think that that I think that that's a
great I think that that's a great path
you know I I think employees are going
to if you're thinking about this from a
company building
standpoint my perspective is that I
would I would create more I would overc
communicate and be more transparent
about what those processes are and how
we would get there and I think that is
my my default in in general is to get
there and I would not overpromise that
those things are true and I think that's
my my struggle with that kind of
statement is I just think and it's like
saying we're going to be the happiest
place you're ever going to work or this
is going to be the best job you're ever
going to have I think that those are
false statements I think you can never
promise those things I think I've been
burned by them because I've worked
places and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and did those
things so I'm probably overly cautious
and I just think it's wrong you know I
want to make those promises and I think
you're just setting yourself up for
disappointment and you're lying to
people so yeah if it were me I wouldn't
do that you know think I think you know
and Nolan I mentioned this to you
earlier this week but like I think
Netflix what they came out with their
revised culture doc this week I think
they did a really nice job of this they
they didn't make a ton of promises but
they put out some statements that I
thought were really strong statements of
what they aspire to be right and I I
kind of pulled it up here of like the
Dream Team we aim only to have high
performers at Netflix people who are
great at what they do and even better at
working together doesn't you know
doesn't promise that we are all the you
know like we're the best but we aim to
do that right which means that they're
gonna have to figure out a way to solve
for that that they have you know great
and always better we often say Netflix
sucks today compared to way where we can
be tomorrow I love that too you know we
need hum humility understand what could
be better like I I think it's I think
it's the humility like I I that that's
what I think that you love about that so
like um you know when you were when you
were sending me hate messages this week
around uh
meritocracy um you had mentioned this
and I agree like I actually think that
this is really well written and so for
the audience it's jobs. netflix.com
culture um this is probably I think
their fifth or sixth iteration that I've
seen of the culture deck from OG Patty
McCord to where it is today um which
says like a lot to me it says like hey
we are going to continue to update this
thing because it's always imperfect as
as are humans but there's one line in
this coling that I think really stood
out to me that I think is um you know
Netflix is a place that isn't really
thought of as like this warm cuddly
place no and I'm seeing a lot of people
now who I think are probably opposed to
the way that Netflix actually runs
performance saying like I really love
this document I think it's this one line
it says while we don't always live up to
these principles
most people who join Netflix are
pleasantly surprised by how great their
colleagues are and the way we Empower
people at every level and I think that
just that one line at the beginning
while we don't always live up to these
principles it
humanizes this this process that says
like we are going to get it wrong
everyone gets it wrong and I think what
bothers people is this notion that like
well this is the way it is and it's all
always this way because we've all been
in these rooms to when somebody has bent
the rules to their favor to where
somebody's open the back door and let
somebody in and that's where I think
everyone gets worked up over meritocracy
and that's where I think Netflix nailed
it David what do you think hey everyone

Heretics here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you

work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics
 
same yeah I I think the the
documentational rules part of this um
meritocracy and Dei I think that's where
they're maybe join at the hip as well
because um where like to col's point
where this becomes real is where you put
it into practice and if everything is
left for you know a biased
interpretation uh then we can't really
live up to the ideals of either and so
you have to start documenting how do
promotions work how does like what do we
mean by performance what does it mean to
exceed expectations and and so you know
putting that out there then then you
have the pressure to actually live up to
it and when we don't did we disclose did
we disclose we talk about hey we live up
to this ideal and we're going to make
that transparent um I I think that's
that's really where the stuff becomes
real on Netflix is uh the the the code
of or their their code their culture
code um they're pretty diverse company
in terms of half almost half the
companies female they they've you know
in terms of a hard charging company so
maybe they don't espouse meritocracy but
in terms of a results driven company it
seem see seemingly that and they're
actually also making quite a bit of
strides on diversity and and document
how we work you know defining how we
work is is really core to how they build
the company yeah know I I was going to
say the other thing about and you know
I'm sure there are a lot of other
companies that you know do this and and
think about
it the choice that you make as a leader
in terms of making these statements and
the ability to be open to giving context
as to how you got here and why I think
is a huge deal like I'm me I'm making
these decisions I'm making these
statements here's how we got here this
is this is the framing for why we're
thinking of doing these things is so
important and so helpful and then
reiterating it over and over as you have
new people come on and then your
willingness both as the I think the HR
person but also as a business leader
it's not just HR like that's the other
thing I always find I mean I give you
know scale credit for being the CEO
who's coming out with this versus like
that you know making an HR person do it
or those kind of things but if I think
back to where I've been more successful
on the HR seat at companies with these
kinds of things is when I given good
context as to like here's what was in
front of us these are the challenges we
were facing this is how we came up with
these Solutions this is how we got here
and then this is what we're hoping to
solve for and then being open to the
feedback and publicly open about that
like I also noan I heard another one of
the your podcasts this week where you
and I are very aligned on this like I
hate anonymous baloney so you know like
I in my last company was very much like
I had the ask Callen slack Channel and
so you know and you publicly had to put
your name on it but I was very open to
suggestions and feedback and then I
would be able to give context back as to
how we got there and we would always
after every sort of you know cycle we
went through when we would look at um
the various pay cycles and those kinds
of things like we'd go back and say like
this many people saw pay change and this
is what we're seeing in market and
you're very open and this is how we're
going to change moving forward like we
would tell people like we saw this
didn't work for people so people would
know that we were actually iterating
just like we iterated on our products
that everything wasn't stagnant that
this was a ever and I think that that
the combination of the context and then
the continual interation to make things
better that we would hear from people
that if things weren't working or if
there was a perception problem that we
were at least a tune to it versus like
in a black box somewhere completely
toned deaf like I think that that goes a
long way hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metav view is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process

accepting imperfections and and calling
them out and then trying to iterate and
make them better I think brings
everybody to the table in a way that
just makes us relatable like it just
makes it more way more human um and I I
love that approach and that's a mistake
I made in my career is like I tried to
have everything be perfect and it's it's
not even aspiration like it's impossible
um you know David I I want to quickly
talk about going back to your Gemini
comment
around Dei and meritocracy are like are
they at odds and I think in in the best
version of themselves they are not and I
think that's that's what your point is
and that's where I think it's like it's
it's really well said and I think that's
that should be the aspiration is like
that's where we should be shooting yeah
I will say though that you know I I'm
starting to get
uncomfortable when we are looking at
race and gender with with these numbers
that we've had had attached to them for
the last 10 to 15 years and putting out
these reports and the reason why is
because of when Dei is not at its best
and I have personally been involved in
conversations I have personally talked
to many exact recruiters that have said
like well we can only hire an insert a
mutable trait like gender or race in
this role and that's that's where I
think this post came from from Alex is
that sort of pressure like whether it
comes from like his employee base
whether that comes from his board
whether it comes from Outsiders in the
company being like well why isn't this
number higher and and that has been my
experience of where Dei hasn't gone
wrong and so I think about this as like
a a pendulum and right now with the
world and the macro environment being
the way that it is everyone's throwing
Dei out I don't think that that's the
future but I also don't think the future
is what we've been trying for the last
 
these sorts of responses from company
leaders as they remove Dei teams as they
come out with policies like Mei like
what scale is doing is because we're
looking at these immutable traits and so
you know I I'm going to go back to what
I said earlier which is I don't think we
should I don't think I should just be
able to say like hey this isn't working
do you think we can measure the success
of diversity um of Dei
specifically without looking at those
numbers because that's the thing that
I'm looking at that provides me a little
bit of uncomfort as I think about where
the future
goes yeah I mean representation and and
the sort of deflating feeling that a lot
of Dei professionals um have when they
release numbers and they look at
representation or the focus on
representation we haven't moved much is
real and I think it takes up a lot of
airtime when we talk about you know is
Dei is it working when we can't move
these these numbers particularly in
monolithic companies you know there is
there's obviously political aspects that
that fact that that sort of seep into
when I think about di I'm thinking about
it as a company leader there's societal
aspects of Dei as well that can like
live on a periphery or sort of come into
the company and I think maybe that's why
Brian said hey we got to take it outside
like is effectively the policy that he
put in place you know years back when I
was at Niantic and just tell a quick
story makers of Pokemon go we would our
our marketing messaging would put out
tweets to our audience in Latin America
to say hey the intent was to say hey
there's an event coming up this weekend
but they were using the wrong tense and
so it said the event was last weekend
and we're like why is no showing up to
our events we don't have any Spanish
speaking people in our marketing and
product team this is a problem it was
like the Genesis for we we need to get
serious about diversity because we were
seeing directly in our our business we
need to reach a wider audience we have
clear gaps and so that was the Genesis
of of our our Dei and we brought in a
terrific individual named Trinidad who
led these efforts now at the same time
what she was dealing with conversations
about Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Brett
Kavanaugh and Donald Trump at the time
and like this is what Dei is about this
is about fighting societal Injustice
like hold on we're makers of Pokémon go
we're trying to make a video game and I
remember having a conversation there
with someone who pulled me aside and
says I am militant about this stuff use
the word militant I'm like we're making
a video game what what I we're trying to
reach people in Latin America like and
so Trinidad was in the middle of that
she was dealing with these forces of
like no this is a societal thing we need
to confront white males and well hold on
we're trying to do this over over here
she kind of zigged this way when people
were expecting her to zigg this way and
what she did was she said I'm going to
try and help us reach black game
developers and so she did this terrific
thing that actually focused on the
business in a way that we didn't
anticipate that made it tangible when we
released our diversity report talked
about um reaching black game developers
reaching a new audience reaching a new
population that we we didn't previously
reach and also reaching a much more
diverse customer base and so we're
bringing it back to the customer you
know and so representation is important
our customers want to make sure the game
works they want to make sure the
messaging works they want to make sure
that like you're not speaking in in the
wrong tense and I'm showing up to an
event that is so bringing it back to the
customer has been where I've seen it
work really well um and celebrated and
actually brings people together as
opposed to like we're going to use this
to sort of confront each other and
divide the company yeah that that point
on focusing on the customer I love and
then the other point that I love is is
Unity versus divis
and and that's you know for For Better
or Worse like what I love about what
coinbase has done and what I love about
what scale has done they picked a path
and they've said like hey if you want to
be on this journey going in this
direction this is what we're doing and
so you can vote with your feet Colleen
you and I have had this discussion many
many times and and I I think it does
Drive Unity even though it's coming at
it from what feels like maybe an
orthogonal angle colen what's your take
on that
yeah I mean oh I have sort of two points
one is I always love when you have any
of these conversations about I don't
care if it's diversity
or who you hire or um you know sort of
college hires versus Senior hires or
whatever it's like what's going to drive
the business forward is really all that
matters at the end of the day like
that's what we're here for that's what
the paycheck is for that's that that's
all that matters we don't have jobs
otherwise if it's not about the business
and our c custom so that's what we
should be focusing on and so the people
who come in should be people who are
motivated by what we're doing and what
that place is about and so I think
anytime you can frame that conversation
for people and and refocus them on that
I think it's helpful so number one I
think you're going to get violent
agreement there number two is I do think
that there some of this conversation is
a bit of a backlash from people who were
frustrated and you know potentially over
the years felt like they didn't have a
voice or they were scared to voice
potentially not feeling included in some
of the de Andi conversations you know or
they were excluded
and um or they didn't like what was
happening and I think if you were
someone who was you know a manager who
was asked to change a rating for some of
your employees so that you know because
hey we need more or women to get a
higher rating and you need to take
somebody down and you were asked to do
that or I want you to go higher just
this ex person and they need to look
like that and I don't care what the rest
of the candidates which are all
practices that we have heard um those
are not practices that I personally when
I was ahead of people pushed on but I
have seen them at companies I have
worked at and been a part of and I know
that they have been frustrating um or
you have felt like you were excluded in
some of these conversations that now you
may feel like this hey well socially
it's acceptable to go out and say these
other things and I don't necessarily
know if that's the right answer either
so it doesn't feel very inclusive on the
other side um I do think numbers are
important frankly like I think it is a
measurement now whether or not that is
the measurement that matters or that is
a measurement that you spend a lot of
time on like there are going to be
measurements that you are required by
law to report whether or not you have to
move those numbers or you care to move
those numbers like that's up to you and
to your point Nolan like I think you can
I the more honest and transparent you
are about how important that is to your
business the better like to your not
exactly people can choose if it's not
important to your company it's not going
to be something that you are going to
Rally around that that's going to be a
big Focus for your company then don't
just don't tell people it is like just
don't lie to them so yeah you know like
and if it is then tell people it is so
then those people can choose and opt
into that culture I think that that's
great so Z or the other just pick a lane
and stick in the lane and then if you
change that lane give people the options
and treat them with respect and let them
make choices like coinbase did and some
other companies did when they when they
made those choices and then they can
decide how they want to operate I do
think the there are companies
where politics Will matter and it will
will make it you know like coinbase is
actually very interesting like politics
really do matter to their company right
now they have absolutely act that is
driving a lot of conversation in
Washington so they can't say that
there's no politics in the office it's
just politics that are related to crypto
and the rest of the politics they don't
want in their office right now right
like so um you know and I appreciate
that that's probably and that's my last
company too like there were
conversations that mattered we talked a
lot about voting because voting drove
the financial system and the decisions
that were made in the financial system
so we definitely talked about those
things and how do you drive voting
because that's important yeah um but I
think you have to be clear from the
beginning through the time that people
are with you as to what Lane you operate
in and give people the choice um as to
you know sort of who you are and what
they're opting in in or out of I I think
that's really well said Colleen we had a
um a listener ping earlier this week and
and she talked about the these Unwritten
rules and I've been thinking about that
comment all week and I think actually
this is the thing that drives people
crazy on both sides of this debate and
this is like will be my my call for
Unity on like if you're team Dei or if
you're team
meritocracy I think the thing that
drives everybody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy are the
unwritten roles is the things that like
were were we know we probably not right
um the things that we don't put on paper
but we're actually pushing behind the
scenes that's what everyone's so tired
of in in today's culture like we want
more
transparency and I think
transparency for me you know it's what
is the the the quote of uh sunlight is
the best
disinfectant and we're going through a
lot of that right now it feels overly on
the side of Dei but to to your point for
both of your points earlier meritocracy
has these words as well and so you know
when we when we actually put the
sunlight on on each of these topics we
find wordss and so if you are a company
leader today and you're thinking about
what is the best path for
us all I can tell you is be transparent
that's what I've learned is just be
transparent be transparent about what's
working be transparent about what's not
working be transparent about your
process be transparent about your
imperfections because the more trans
parency that you provide the less
hypocritical you are and that's where
everyone's hackles rise on both of these
issues is when you're a hypocrite and we
know it but we're not allowed to talk
about it because it's the secret thing
that happened in the back room that's
where you drive people insane so I just
want to say thank you both for another
one of these like difficult
conversations to crack into I know
they're a little bit uncomfortable at
times but just as as friends I sincerely
appreciate your authenticity and your
vulnerability to get into these topics
and Colleen and David this is why we
love having you on and I think our
listeners are going to love this
