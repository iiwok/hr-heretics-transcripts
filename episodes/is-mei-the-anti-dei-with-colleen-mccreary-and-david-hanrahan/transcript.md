haven't actually heard that term sort of
 
haven't actually heard that term sort of
spinning in the in the era I mean I that
 
spinning in the in the era I mean I that
was a big term back in my Microsoft days
 
was a big term back in my Microsoft days
 
know value for us and that was like 14
 
know value for us and that was like 14
 
a new term at all but it's got so much
 
a new term at all but it's got so much
baggage um and you saw it Nolan like you
 
baggage um and you saw it Nolan like you
kind of like threw it out there when you
 
kind of like threw it out there when you
first saw it not thinking it was going
 
first saw it not thinking it was going
to be much of anything and then I I saw
 
to be much of anything and then I I saw
your your post on LinkedIn and it was
 
your your post on LinkedIn and it was
like flood I mean you love a good flood
 
like flood I mean you love a good flood
of you know lention so for you it was
 
of you know lention so for you it was
great um and I just felt like it's not
 
great um and I just felt like it's not
you know philosophically I I don't think
 
you know philosophically I I don't think
it's a bad idea I mean in fact I think a
 
it's a bad idea I mean in fact I think a
lot of us don't think the concept of
 
lot of us don't think the concept of
finding the person who's the most
 
finding the person who's the most
qualified and rewarding the people who
 
qualified and rewarding the people who
are the most qualified for doing you
 
are the most qualified for doing you
know having the highest impact I don't
 
know having the highest impact I don't
know a lot people who would be opposed
 
know a lot people who would be opposed
to that but that word just sets people
 
to that but that word just sets people
off in in so many ways and that's where
 
off in in so many ways and that's where
I was like just needs a branding I mean
 
I was like just needs a branding I mean
it's just a bad brand at this point so
 
it's just a bad brand at this point so
maybe we should think of a better word
 
maybe we should think of a better word
or a better term or a better way to go
 
or a better term or a better way to go
about it um and and it could and and
 
about it um and and it could and and
then figure out a better way to do it
 
then figure out a better way to do it
and I also think that you know in so in
 
and I also think that you know in so in
the article that I wrote I was speaking
 
the article that I wrote I was speaking
of this that it's not exactly
 
of this that it's not exactly
meritocracy as a philosophy we all kind
 
meritocracy as a philosophy we all kind
of wrap our arms around and we do agree
 
of wrap our arms around and we do agree
with the philosophy isn't bad it's the
 
with the philosophy isn't bad it's the
execution that is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
execution that is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
hard um and it's really really hard to
 
hard um and it's really really hard to
get right in the sense that every
 
get right in the sense that every
stakeholder can agree and align and
 
stakeholder can agree and align and
believe that it's that it's true and
 
believe that it's that it's true and
that's where it seems to fall down in so
 
that's where it seems to fall down in so
many ways or that people seem to have
 
many ways or that people seem to have
and I think Kelly even spoke on this you
 
and I think Kelly even spoke on this you
know at a one of your other podcasts
 
know at a one of your other podcasts
that like I think people have Scar
 
that like I think people have Scar
Tissue like where they they believed in
 
Tissue like where they they believed in
the system or they trusted that
 
the system or they trusted that
something was going to go right or they
 
something was going to go right or they
they believed that this was happening
 
they believed that this was happening
and then they saw some example or they
 
and then they saw some example or they
felt like they got wronged or screwed or
 
felt like they got wronged or screwed or
and that didn't happen and then you know
 
and that didn't happen and then you know
so now they don't believe it anymore so
 
so now they don't believe it anymore so
I've been trying to learn and and figure
 
I've been trying to learn and and figure
out where people have an issue
 
out where people have an issue
specifically with the term meritocracy I
 
specifically with the term meritocracy I
think there is even some people who have
 
think there is even some people who have
an issue with the term Merit and what
 
an issue with the term Merit and what
I've been hearing from folks is that
 
I've been hearing from folks is that
it's it's hypocritical it's like we say
 
it's it's hypocritical it's like we say
we do these things until the rubber
 
we do these things until the rubber
meets the road and then it feels like
 
meets the road and then it feels like
rules for thee but not for me uh for the
 
rules for thee but not for me uh for the
very special people in the organization
 
very special people in the organization
who get to operate on their own with
 
who get to operate on their own with
impunity David is is that why
 
impunity David is is that why
meritocracy has so many haters or what
 
meritocracy has so many haters or what
is your take on why meritocracy comes
 
is your take on why meritocracy comes
with the baggage that Colleen's talking
 
with the baggage that Colleen's talking
about I I think that I think that's a
 
about I I think that I think that's a
lot of it um Kelly talked about the
 
lot of it um Kelly talked about the
GitHub rug and um uh why the rug uh was
 
GitHub rug and um uh why the rug uh was
was quietly brought out of the office um
 
was quietly brought out of the office um
and and I think when you start like hey
 
and and I think when you start like hey
meritocracy is calling talking about is
 
meritocracy is calling talking about is
an ideal or it's an ethos of like hey
 
an ideal or it's an ethos of like hey
isn't that a great isn't that a great
 
isn't that a great isn't that a great
ethos but then you start breaking it
 
ethos but then you start breaking it
down you know like well referrals you
 
down you know like well referrals you
know we refer 30% you know 30% of our
 
know we refer 30% you know 30% of our
hires are referral so someone literally
 
hires are referral so someone literally
knows someone and that's how they got in
 
knows someone and that's how they got in
or they they they FastTrack through the
 
or they they they FastTrack through the
interview process does that fly in the
 
interview process does that fly in the
face of a meritocracy like you know we
 
face of a meritocracy like you know we
we know that referrals are oftentimes
 
we know that referrals are oftentimes
really great hires but did we cast a
 
really great hires but did we cast a
wide net and this is really the best
 
wide net and this is really the best
person or hey we trust We Trust so and
 
person or hey we trust We Trust so and
so so let's hire that person obviously
 
so so let's hire that person obviously
there's plenty of instances as as
 
there's plenty of instances as as
founding founding of uh founding stories
 
founding founding of uh founding stories
for companies where um we knew someone
 
for companies where um we knew someone
you know we knew someone my parent uh
 
you know we knew someone my parent uh
worked in this industry and knows a lot
 
worked in this industry and knows a lot
of doctors or or what have you and um
 
of doctors or or what have you and um
you know that's that's kind of how we
 
you know that's that's kind of how we
got connected to investors that's how we
 
got connected to investors that's how we
built our business by we knew people
 
built our business by we knew people
versus the the founder who's in the
 
versus the the founder who's in the
middle of nowhere who doesn't have those
 
middle of nowhere who doesn't have those
connections and didn't get the same
 
connections and didn't get the same
level of investment so so I think
 
level of investment so so I think
there's just so many instances where it
 
there's just so many instances where it
falls apart and so it's like yeah it's a
 
falls apart and so it's like yeah it's a
great great ideal but we can't say this
 
great great ideal but we can't say this
is us 100% like we're going to strive
 
is us 100% like we're going to strive
for it um but we're not going to get 100
 
for it um but we're not going to get 100
per. and I think when you write
 
per. and I think when you write
something like Alexander did it kind of
 
something like Alexander did it kind of
sounds like it's unimpeachable like it's
 
sounds like it's unimpeachable like it's
just it's us 100% and that's why people
 
just it's us 100% and that's why people
roll their
 
roll their
eyes well and let's and let's be real
 
eyes well and let's and let's be real
I'm going to take a real live example
 
I'm going to take a real live example
today do you think that bronnie James if
 
today do you think that bronnie James if
he wasn't LeBron James Sun would have
 
he wasn't LeBron James Sun would have
been drafted by the Lakers like based on
 
been drafted by the Lakers like based on
his stats coming out of USC like not
 
his stats coming out of USC like not
everybody's a sports person and I know
 
everybody's a sports person and I know
that not everybody likes using Sports
 
that not everybody likes using Sports

analogies but like that's that's today's
news and yep I I I got to tell you like
 
news and yep I I I got to tell you like
I would not have predicted that if I
 
I would not have predicted that if I

that school and that record I don't see
 
that school and that record I don't see
that happening for that person going to
 
that happening for that person going to
the Lakers this year like 100% okay so
 
the Lakers this year like 100% okay so

so totally agree with you I think what
I'm what I'm hearing and learning from
 
I'm what I'm hearing and learning from
people is that the the issue with
 
people is that the the issue with
meritocracy is that it's hypocritical
 
meritocracy is that it's hypocritical
and selectively applied it's like for

selective memory of these kinds of
 
selective memory of these kinds of
things right like I I can very strongly
 
things right like I I can very strongly
remember a CEO who thinks that he is as
 
remember a CEO who thinks that he is as
the most meritocratic person around and
 
the most meritocratic person around and
we were doing layoffs and when I present
 
we were doing layoffs and when I present

high half the day like they don't work
that hard anymore like this person
 
that hard anymore like this person
should be out you know like and so that
 
should be out you know like and so that
refresh of what have you done for me
 
refresh of what have you done for me
lately you know like we we have a re
 
lately you know like we we have a re
people struggle to recalibrate on a
 
people struggle to recalibrate on a
regular basis and what's your system to
 
regular basis and what's your system to
recalibrate and how how do we
 
recalibrate and how how do we
reapply that idea of the what is Merit
 
reapply that idea of the what is Merit
and what is excellence and you know sort
 
and what is excellence and you know sort
of it's hard I mean it's just really
 
of it's hard I mean it's just really
that's that's why I go back to the
 
that's that's why I go back to the
systems and the process and the all of
 
systems and the process and the all of
these things to make sure that you're
 
these things to make sure that you're
consistently it's not just when you come
 
consistently it's not just when you come
in the door and how you get in the door
 
in the door and how you get in the door
it's the continued nature of how to
 
it's the continued nature of how to
reapply those things and make sure that
 
reapply those things and make sure that
they are appropriately being layered in
 
they are appropriately being layered in
and that everybody sees it and can
 
and that everybody sees it and can
appreciate it and understand how those
 
appreciate it and understand how those
decisions are being made um
 
decisions are being made um
across the the system that you have I
 
across the the system that you have I
think I think that's well said now I'm a
 
think I think that's well said now I'm a
big believer in hey we should absolutely
 
big believer in hey we should absolutely
call out the problems with the system
 
call out the problems with the system
but we should also be thinking about
 
but we should also be thinking about
what are viable
 
what are viable
Alternatives totally and and and this is
 
Alternatives totally and and and this is
where like in our community and in
 
where like in our community and in
people leaders and HR folks I have been
 
people leaders and HR folks I have been
searching for a viable alternative and
 
searching for a viable alternative and

company building
 
company building
standpoint my perspective is that I
 
standpoint my perspective is that I
would I would create more I would overc
 
would I would create more I would overc
communicate and be more transparent
 
communicate and be more transparent
about what those processes are and how
 
about what those processes are and how
we would get there and I think that is
 
we would get there and I think that is
my my default in in general is to get
 
my my default in in general is to get
there and I would not overpromise that
 
there and I would not overpromise that
those things are true and I think that's
 
those things are true and I think that's
my my struggle with that kind of
 
my my struggle with that kind of
statement is I just think and it's like
 
statement is I just think and it's like
saying we're going to be the happiest
 
saying we're going to be the happiest
place you're ever going to work or this
 
place you're ever going to work or this
is going to be the best job you're ever
 
is going to be the best job you're ever
going to have I think that those are
 
going to have I think that those are
false statements I think you can never
 
false statements I think you can never
promise those things I think I've been
 
promise those things I think I've been
burned by them because I've worked
 
burned by them because I've worked
places and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and did those
 
places and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and did those
things so I'm probably overly cautious
 
things so I'm probably overly cautious
and I just think it's wrong you know I
 
and I just think it's wrong you know I
want to make those promises and I think
 
want to make those promises and I think
