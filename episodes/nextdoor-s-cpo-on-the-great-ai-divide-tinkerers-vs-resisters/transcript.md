All right. What's happening everyone?
 
All right. What's happening everyone?
Welcome back to another fun-filled
 
Welcome back to another fun-filled
session of HR Heretics. It's Friday,
 
session of HR Heretics. It's Friday,
right boys? It's Friday.
 
right boys? It's Friday.
&gt;&gt; Um, I can't believe it. We have Brian
 
&gt;&gt; Um, I can't believe it. We have Brian
Power back on the show, everyone joining
 
Power back on the show, everyone joining
us today. Um, we had dinner a few weeks
 
us today. Um, we had dinner a few weeks
ago, Brian, and Brian and I sat next to
 
ago, Brian, and Brian and I sat next to
each other. Thank you, Nolan, for making
 
each other. Thank you, Nolan, for making
that happen. And we were talking about
 
that happen. And we were talking about
AI. We were talking about,
 
AI. We were talking about,
you know, all the fanfare and all the
 
you know, all the fanfare and all the
all the stuff out there around it, the
 
all the stuff out there around it, the
reality of how you actually do this
 
reality of how you actually do this
day-to-day. And a lot of people we've
 
day-to-day. And a lot of people we've
been talking to recently, Nolan, and
 
been talking to recently, Nolan, and
I've been personally talking to high
 
I've been personally talking to high
level, right? people, officers,
 
level, right? people, officers,
operators, a lot of them have been
 
operators, a lot of them have been
saying, "I actually don't do anything
 
saying, "I actually don't do anything
with AI during the day because I don't
 
with AI during the day because I don't
have time. I'm actually building stuff.
 
have time. I'm actually building stuff.
It's a distraction. It takes time away
 
It's a distraction. It takes time away
from that." And I've heard that a lot.
 
from that." And I've heard that a lot.
And Brian at dinner was like, "I'm the
 
And Brian at dinner was like, "I'm the
opposite. I literally just tinker most
 
opposite. I literally just tinker most
of the day. I carve out time for it. I
 
of the day. I carve out time for it. I
think that we own this strategy, not
 
think that we own this strategy, not
just for ourselves, for the company."
 
just for ourselves, for the company."
And I was like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that is a
 
And I was like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that is a
huge chasm between what I've been
 
huge chasm between what I've been
hearing and what you're saying." And I
 
hearing and what you're saying." And I
want to I want to understand what that
 
want to I want to understand what that
looks like and feels like with you
 
looks like and feels like with you
dayto-day. And then we're going to end
 
dayto-day. And then we're going to end
with our favorite corporate lingo, which
 
with our favorite corporate lingo, which
is a new fun-filled rapid fire round. I
 
is a new fun-filled rapid fire round. I
put in here, which is the worst company
 
put in here, which is the worst company
phrases you're hearing out in the wild.
 
phrases you're hearing out in the wild.
We all hear them. We all say them. I'm
 
We all hear them. We all say them. I'm
guilty. And we're going to make fun of
 
guilty. And we're going to make fun of
some of them. So, let's kick off. Brian,
 
some of them. So, let's kick off. Brian,
so tell us about what you're doing at
 
so tell us about what you're doing at
Next Door with AI, how you think about
 
Next Door with AI, how you think about
it, you know, in general, and we'll jump
 
it, you know, in general, and we'll jump
in here with some some uh conversation.
 
in here with some some uh conversation.
&gt;&gt; Sounds great. Well, first, thanks for
 
&gt;&gt; Sounds great. Well, first, thanks for
having me back. Repeat guest. I feel
 
having me back. Repeat guest. I feel
honored. I'm a huge fan of the
 
honored. I'm a huge fan of the
franchise. If there's merch, I want to
 
franchise. If there's merch, I want to
buy it. I mentioned to you all, I I
 
buy it. I mentioned to you all, I I
consume this on my commute in and you
 
consume this on my commute in and you
know, I basically demanded you let me
 
know, I basically demanded you let me
back in because I' I've been talking to
 
back in because I' I've been talking to
you in my car and you can't hear me. So,
 
you in my car and you can't hear me. So,
it's great we can all get get together
 
it's great we can all get get together
live on this.
 
live on this.
&gt;&gt; No, you're not the first person that's
 
&gt;&gt; No, you're not the first person that's
told us. Like, I yell at you in my car.
 
told us. Like, I yell at you in my car.
What What is that? What do you yell?
 
What What is that? What do you yell?
&gt;&gt; That's the right emotion. That's That's
 
&gt;&gt; That's the right emotion. That's That's
the right emotion we want.
 
the right emotion we want.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Is what Nolan say make you scream?
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Is what Nolan say make you scream?
Like, what what do you what do you
 
Like, what what do you what do you
&gt;&gt; So, both of you are offenders. I think
 
&gt;&gt; So, both of you are offenders. I think
the brand you've developed is excellent.
 
the brand you've developed is excellent.
You you you come with real opinions on
 
You you you come with real opinions on
things that are that are happening and
 
things that are that are happening and
and sometimes my yells are absolutely
 
and sometimes my yells are absolutely
this is so right. Why don't more people
 
this is so right. Why don't more people
say this? And sometimes I want to be
 
say this? And sometimes I want to be
like, you're crazy. There's no way.
 
like, you're crazy. There's no way.
&gt;&gt; You're the dumbest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people on
 
&gt;&gt; You're the dumbest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people on
planet Earth. Nolan Kelly.
 
planet Earth. Nolan Kelly.
&gt;&gt; I think that's why I love this podcast
 
&gt;&gt; I think that's why I love this podcast
and I I think, you know, I think other
 
and I I think, you know, I think other
people do too cuz so so the I think it's
 
people do too cuz so so the I think it's
great the universe of people focused
 
great the universe of people focused
podcast has grown so much since co and I
 
podcast has grown so much since co and I
think the communities sharing and
 
think the communities sharing and
learning is all is all good. But um I
 
learning is all is all good. But um I
like you're a little more unvarnished
 
like you're a little more unvarnished
and that's that's my jam. I really
 
and that's that's my jam. I really
appreciate it. So, keep it up.
 
appreciate it. So, keep it up.
&gt;&gt; I think the last
 
&gt;&gt; I think the last
&gt;&gt; I was say I think the last time that I
 
&gt;&gt; I was say I think the last time that I
was on, we talked a little bit about AI.
 
was on, we talked a little bit about AI.
This was months ago, you know, and I
 
This was months ago, you know, and I
think that lots is lots really happened
 
think that lots is lots really happened
&gt;&gt; with AI and AI in the workplace. And um
 
&gt;&gt; with AI and AI in the workplace. And um
so I think, you know, outside of Next
 
so I think, you know, outside of Next
Door, I'm certainly feeling like
 
Door, I'm certainly feeling like
resistance. There's a lot of people who
 
resistance. There's a lot of people who
are like this thing didn't out of the
 
are like this thing didn't out of the
box make us all superhuman, so false
 
box make us all superhuman, so false
advertising. Yeah.
 
advertising. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or to your point, Kelly, people like,
 
&gt;&gt; Or to your point, Kelly, people like,
"Okay, I gotta try this." And then it
 
"Okay, I gotta try this." And then it
doesn't
 
doesn't
&gt;&gt; there's all these things that go wrong.
 
&gt;&gt; there's all these things that go wrong.
It doesn't work. And then you're like,
 
It doesn't work. And then you're like,
"Okay, now I'm behind. Now I got to go
 
"Okay, now I'm behind. Now I got to go
do the stuff I was supposed to do today
 
do the stuff I was supposed to do today
and and I lost an hour, so I can't do
 
and and I lost an hour, so I can't do
that again." And that overhead of having
 
that again." And that overhead of having
to learn. I I think in general people
 
to learn. I I think in general people
are saying um you know, everyone's
 
are saying um you know, everyone's
talking about AI bubble. Every freaking
 
talking about AI bubble. Every freaking
company is now selling AI. Their product
 
company is now selling AI. Their product
is now AI. So it's just it's just it's
 
is now AI. So it's just it's just it's
bubbly. It's and it's hot. Um, but I I
 
bubbly. It's and it's hot. Um, but I I
think the resistance has come from
 
think the resistance has come from
people know how to do their jobs and
 
people know how to do their jobs and
they're trying to do it and trying to
 
they're trying to do it and trying to
have people do their job in a different
 
have people do their job in a different
way takes time and you might not figure
 
way takes time and you might not figure
it out as you get into it. So that's
 
it out as you get into it. So that's
just in general going to slow slow
 
just in general going to slow slow
things down and people are going to go
 
things down and people are going to go
back to doing what they're doing. And I
 
back to doing what they're doing. And I
do think the narrative like the some of
 
do think the narrative like the some of
the CEO takes are just so cringey, you
 
the CEO takes are just so cringey, you
know, and and I think that this is
 
know, and and I think that this is
there's a real fear in a lot of
 
there's a real fear in a lot of
workplaces that you're being asked to
 
workplaces that you're being asked to
figure out how to rem remove your job
 
figure out how to rem remove your job
and people are kind of like why would I
 
and people are kind of like why would I
why would I do that? You know, I
 
why would I do that? You know, I
certainly I don't I don't think we have
 
certainly I don't I don't think we have
that issue at Next Door because we're
 
that issue at Next Door because we're
very much trying to activate the energy
 
very much trying to activate the energy
to use it to grow each other, our
 
to use it to grow each other, our
opportunity. It's like how can someone
 
opportunity. It's like how can someone
do the work of more people versus how
 
do the work of more people versus how
can we do something with less people.
 
can we do something with less people.
That's that's been our vantage point
 
That's that's been our vantage point
with with AI. Um and inside of of Next
 
with with AI. Um and inside of of Next
Door um you know I've been I've been
 
Door um you know I've been I've been
here for seven years and I'm very lucky
 
here for seven years and I'm very lucky
that my team you know my direct reports
 
that my team you know my direct reports
we've all worked together for like at
 
we've all worked together for like at
least 5 years. So, we have the benefit
 
least 5 years. So, we have the benefit
of having been together through a lot um
 
of having been together through a lot um
to cover just call it kind of normal
 
to cover just call it kind of normal
people team stuff, but that also lets us
 
people team stuff, but that also lets us
work in new areas because we're not
 
work in new areas because we're not
trying to cover gaps or building going
 
trying to cover gaps or building going
through team building like we're we have
 
through team building like we're we have
a little bit of an advantage in that
 
a little bit of an advantage in that
regards. Um but that I've tried to take
 
regards. Um but that I've tried to take
advantage of that opportunity for all of
 
advantage of that opportunity for all of
us to really push us to try to figure
 
us to really push us to try to figure
this stuff out really going back now a
 
this stuff out really going back now a
year. So um internally next door I'm the
 
year. So um internally next door I'm the
the you know the leader of the cross
 
the you know the leader of the cross
functional effort to bring AI into the
 
functional effort to bring AI into the
workplace. We call it project neighbor
 
workplace. We call it project neighbor
neighbor spelled N AI B O R. We love
 
neighbor spelled N AI B O R. We love
neighbors at Next Door and we fused it
 
neighbors at Next Door and we fused it
with AI and I'm working really closely
 
with AI and I'm working really closely
with our IS and IT teams uh and our
 
with our IS and IT teams uh and our
engineering teams and we've really just
 
engineering teams and we've really just
tried to build the internal community
 
tried to build the internal community
around this and I think you know what
 
around this and I think you know what
you're getting at Kelly is the early
 
you're getting at Kelly is the early
curve. There was an article in Hacker
 
curve. There was an article in Hacker
News that talked about this is that
 
News that talked about this is that
engineers actually became less
 
engineers actually became less
productive when they first started using
 
productive when they first started using
AI but then when they learn how to use
 
AI but then when they learn how to use
it they can become more productive. But
 
it they can become more productive. But
you hit this initial wall until people
 
you hit this initial wall until people
stop. And I I thought that was a good
 
stop. And I I thought that was a good
example of what everybody really runs
 
example of what everybody really runs
into because I definitely lost a lot of
 
into because I definitely lost a lot of
time a few months ago,
 
time a few months ago,
but now I feel like uh how we do things
 
but now I feel like uh how we do things
as a team, how I set up my day, how I
 
as a team, how I set up my day, how I
try to use it, I can't imagine not
 
try to use it, I can't imagine not
having these tools available, you know?
 
having these tools available, you know?
&gt;&gt; So give us give us that rundown though,
 
&gt;&gt; So give us give us that rundown though,
Brian. Like what is it like daytoday?
 
Brian. Like what is it like daytoday?
Like how do you think about this? And
 
Like how do you think about this? And
then broadly how are you thinking about
 
then broadly how are you thinking about
you know
 
you know
instituting this AI process across an
 
instituting this AI process across an
entire company when there is resistance.
 
entire company when there is resistance.
&gt;&gt; So I'll use a specific example of what I
 
&gt;&gt; So I'll use a specific example of what I
did at the beginning of the year that I
 
did at the beginning of the year that I
think helped me help galvanize some of
 
think helped me help galvanize some of
the learning. So we one of the best
 
the learning. So we one of the best
practices you should do is just offer
 
practices you should do is just offer
training. You know people don't know how
 
training. You know people don't know how
to use it. So you should train them on
 
to use it. So you should train them on
AI and you could just download you can
 
AI and you could just download you can
just use stuff from OpenAI's website or
 
just use stuff from OpenAI's website or
LinkedIn learning like there's just
 
LinkedIn learning like there's just
stuff out there to get the basics going
 
stuff out there to get the basics going
and you should push that and say people
 
and you should push that and say people
you should take training. So um we don't
 
you should take training. So um we don't
have a a dedicated L &amp; D team at Next
 
have a a dedicated L &amp; D team at Next
Door and I wanted to kind of create the
 
Door and I wanted to kind of create the
training and so I normally historically
 
training and so I normally historically
would have partnered with a facilitator
 
would have partnered with a facilitator
or a program designer to create a
 
or a program designer to create a
training. I didn't have one. So I forced
 
training. I didn't have one. So I forced
myself to use chat GPT to develop the
 
myself to use chat GPT to develop the
training, right? And what I found was it
 
training, right? And what I found was it
actually that what had been historically
 
actually that what had been historically
like an iterative process with a program
 
like an iterative process with a program
designer was happening at such a higher
 
designer was happening at such a higher
velocity that I was able to kind of get
 
velocity that I was able to kind of get
to the content I wanted to train in a
 
to the content I wanted to train in a
much shorter amount of time than I would
 
much shorter amount of time than I would
have had with working sessions with like
 
have had with working sessions with like
an L &amp; D. And I've had some great L &amp; D
 
an L &amp; D. And I've had some great L &amp; D
practitioners, but just the the nature
 
practitioners, but just the the nature
of the immediacy of me kind of get to
 
of the immediacy of me kind of get to
okay, here's what's going to be on the
 
okay, here's what's going to be on the
slides and here's going to be a class
 
slides and here's going to be a class
was like really kind of that was like a
 
was like really kind of that was like a
first real insight for me to develop
 
first real insight for me to develop
this course. And then I realized like I
 
this course. And then I realized like I
can just teach this course. Like all I
 
can just teach this course. Like all I
got to do now is just show up. And so I
 
got to do now is just show up. And so I
think a lot of chief people officers
 
think a lot of chief people officers
would like to do more things like
 
would like to do more things like
facilitate or present or teach but like
 
facilitate or present or teach but like
the pre-work time allocation is what
 
the pre-work time allocation is what
prevents you from doing it. So I just
 
prevents you from doing it. So I just
decided, hey, I this teaching will help
 
decided, hey, I this teaching will help
me learn too. So I kind of led our AI
 
me learn too. So I kind of led our AI
fundamentals training that I I created
 
fundamentals training that I I created
by kind of borrowing from other
 
by kind of borrowing from other
companies and really made it our own.
 
companies and really made it our own.
And so one of the first insights that I
 
And so one of the first insights that I
think is really important that's part of
 
think is really important that's part of
this training is you have to start to
 
this training is you have to start to
think about a product like Claude or
 
think about a product like Claude or
Chat GBT as a teammate, not as a tool.
 
Chat GBT as a teammate, not as a tool.
And this kind of came to life with me
 
And this kind of came to life with me
when I was making a training with China
 
when I was making a training with China
GBT in the same way that I would have
 
GBT in the same way that I would have
made a training with a program manager
 
made a training with a program manager
in the past. I was like, "Oh, I kind of
 
in the past. I was like, "Oh, I kind of
get it." Where most software is like a
 
get it." Where most software is like a
tool, you know? You're just kind of like
 
tool, you know? You're just kind of like
it spits back data to you. But the more
 
it spits back data to you. But the more
I invested in creating the teammate and
 
I invested in creating the teammate and
treating it like a teammate, the more I
 
treating it like a teammate, the more I
got out of it. And so this led to
 
got out of it. And so this led to
something Kelly and I were talking about
 
something Kelly and I were talking about
at dinner. I've actually now changed my
 
at dinner. I've actually now changed my
calendar to where I have one-on- ones
 
calendar to where I have one-on- ones
that it's called one-on-one with a
 
that it's called one-on-one with a
certain GPT that I've made. So like that
 
certain GPT that I've made. So like that
AI teammate and then what that used to
 
AI teammate and then what that used to
be like I'll block time right like
 
be like I'll block time right like
creative time or work time like people
 
creative time or work time like people
use that type of thing but there was
 
use that type of thing but there was
this shift when I set it up like an
 
this shift when I set it up like an
actual one-on-one with a specific type
 
actual one-on-one with a specific type
of GBT that is meant for a certain type
 
of GBT that is meant for a certain type
of problem. It became this like
 
of problem. It became this like
one-on-one working session that was way
 
one-on-one working session that was way
more focused and would really start to
 
more focused and would really start to
produce outcomes.
 
produce outcomes.
&gt;&gt; That I'm gonna stop there that
 
&gt;&gt; That I'm gonna stop there that
&gt;&gt; that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool. So, like I don't
 
&gt;&gt; that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool. So, like I don't
know about you all listening, but when
 
know about you all listening, but when
Brian just said, "I set up one-on ones
 
Brian just said, "I set up one-on ones
with Chad GBT," I was thinking like
 
with Chad GBT," I was thinking like
you're you're setting up one-on- ones
 
you're you're setting up one-on- ones
with a human and you're going to talk
 
with a human and you're going to talk
about chat GBT. Like, no, you literally
 
about chat GBT. Like, no, you literally
are booking time with these agents just
 
are booking time with these agents just
to tinker with them.
 
to tinker with them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, like I have 45 minutes later
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, like I have 45 minutes later
today. And so, what it's like when you
 
today. And so, what it's like when you
have one-on- ones with your directs, you
 
have one-on- ones with your directs, you
each have a list of the stuff you're
 
each have a list of the stuff you're
going to go over when you get to that
 
going to go over when you get to that
one-on-one. And so I'm kind of
 
one-on-one. And so I'm kind of
dedicating this space to a certain type
 
dedicating this space to a certain type
of thing I want to work on later the
 
of thing I want to work on later the
same way I would with someone on my
 
same way I would with someone on my
team. And but that is very different
 
team. And but that is very different
from like experimenting with AI during
 
from like experimenting with AI during
like a work time. We're working.
 
like a work time. We're working.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is where the rubber hits the
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is where the rubber hits the
road on a lot of this stuff right now in
 
road on a lot of this stuff right now in
my opinion where it's like that's great
 
my opinion where it's like that's great
you're what exactly are you going to do
 
you're what exactly are you going to do
later? First of all, kudos to you Friday
 
later? First of all, kudos to you Friday
afternoon with Chad GBT. Like that is
 
afternoon with Chad GBT. Like that is
that is commitment. Hey everyone, we'll
 
that is commitment. Hey everyone, we'll
be right back in a moment after a word
 
be right back in a moment after a word
from our sponsors. On this show, we tell
 
from our sponsors. On this show, we tell
the truth about HR. And one of my
 
the truth about HR. And one of my
favorite conversations we've had was
 
favorite conversations we've had was
with Melanie Nanho. She put it so
 
with Melanie Nanho. She put it so
simply. HR isn't about optimizing for
 
simply. HR isn't about optimizing for
compliance. It's optimizing for people,
 
compliance. It's optimizing for people,
for culture, trust, and workplaces where
 
for culture, trust, and workplaces where
folks actually want to stay. That's why
 
folks actually want to stay. That's why
I'm such a fan of what Melanie and her
 
I'm such a fan of what Melanie and her
team at Athena are building. She was
 
team at Athena are building. She was
brutally honest about it. So Athena,
 
brutally honest about it. So Athena,
we're a compliance company which uh
 
we're a compliance company which uh
let's just put it out there that sounds
 
let's just put it out there that sounds
pretty boring if you think about it
 
pretty boring if you think about it
right okay harassment prevention
 
right okay harassment prevention
training not very exciting right we are
 
training not very exciting right we are
very lucky in that we are in the HR tech
 
very lucky in that we are in the HR tech
space that's required right harassment
 
space that's required right harassment
prevention training is not really
 
prevention training is not really
optional you need it the question is who
 
optional you need it the question is who
are you going to use for it
 
are you going to use for it
&gt;&gt; exactly you're doing this training
 
&gt;&gt; exactly you're doing this training
whether you want to or not but here's
 
whether you want to or not but here's
what she told us about the impact
 
what she told us about the impact

So very specifically, we next door we
 
So very specifically, we next door we
have a leadership offsite, the executive
 
have a leadership offsite, the executive
team in two weeks and I'm putting
 
team in two weeks and I'm putting
together the agenda and I was just in
 
together the agenda and I was just in
New York this week talking to a bunch of
 
New York this week talking to a bunch of
the people that will be at the offsite.
 
the people that will be at the offsite.
So I've got kind of their input on how
 
So I've got kind of their input on how
we're going to run some of the sessions
 
we're going to run some of the sessions
and now I'm going to pump it into CHBT
 
and now I'm going to pump it into CHBT
and like turbocharge the agenda that
 
and like turbocharge the agenda that
will be like we're going to send out the
 
will be like we're going to send out the
pre-work a week before the offsite. So,
 
pre-work a week before the offsite. So,
normally that would be much longer, but
 
normally that would be much longer, but
now because my GPT has history with me
 
now because my GPT has history with me
as a chief people officer and other
 
as a chief people officer and other
products I've worked on at Next Door,
 
products I've worked on at Next Door,
like I can say, "Hey, this is this is
 
like I can say, "Hey, this is this is
what we're going to be discussing." Like
 
what we're going to be discussing." Like
I I want help me figure out how what
 
I I want help me figure out how what
should people what should the template
 
should people what should the template
look like that I want the people leading
 
look like that I want the people leading
the discussions in advance to fill in.
 
the discussions in advance to fill in.
That will be like minutes versus just
 
That will be like minutes versus just
cut and paste what we did last time, you
 
cut and paste what we did last time, you
know? And you can really quickly now the
 
know? And you can really quickly now the
familiar the familiar nature of it now
 
familiar the familiar nature of it now
means I can I know what it will do well
 
means I can I know what it will do well
and not do well. So we're going to have
 
and not do well. So we're going to have
not like oh he obviously used chat GPT
 
not like oh he obviously used chat GPT
to generate the agenda, right? Like I'm
 
to generate the agenda, right? Like I'm
just going to use it as like my co-pilot
 
just going to use it as like my co-pilot
to create a great agenda for our
 
to create a great agenda for our
offsite. And that's one of the things
 
offsite. And that's one of the things
I'm do.
 
I'm do.
&gt;&gt; The thing there what you're saying
 
&gt;&gt; The thing there what you're saying
though which is really interesting is
 
though which is really interesting is
that you're you're meeting with people
 
that you're you're meeting with people
to inform what you're going to use as
 
to inform what you're going to use as
your inputs. Are you recording those
 
your inputs. Are you recording those
conversations, Brian?
 
conversations, Brian?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
 
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, then I'd say the default is to
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, then I'd say the default is to
try to just to transcribe the notes also
 
try to just to transcribe the notes also
as a way to just
 
as a way to just
&gt;&gt; I'm terrible at taking notes now, right?
 
&gt;&gt; I'm terrible at taking notes now, right?
Like,
 
Like,
&gt;&gt; and like it's so much lost. It's so much
 
&gt;&gt; and like it's so much lost. It's so much
lost. So, just having the default be
 
lost. So, just having the default be
like, we should probably not record
 
like, we should probably not record
maybe one or two things, but we really
 
maybe one or two things, but we really
should record as much as we can because
 
should record as much as we can because
it's going to make better.
 
it's going to make better.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, but then I'm assuming what
 
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, but then I'm assuming what
you're doing is then you're taking the
 
you're doing is then you're taking the
transcript
 
transcript
&gt;&gt; of all of those conversations. Yeah,
 
&gt;&gt; of all of those conversations. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; you're pumping in those transcripts
 
&gt;&gt; you're pumping in those transcripts
&gt;&gt; and then you're saying I have a I have
 
&gt;&gt; and then you're saying I have a I have
an exact offsite in two weeks. What I
 
an exact offsite in two weeks. What I
want help with is setting the agenda and
 
want help with is setting the agenda and
then for each agenda item like the
 
then for each agenda item like the
things we really need to discuss that
 
things we really need to discuss that
need to be on there and then what do you
 
need to be on there and then what do you
think should be what what do you think
 
think should be what what do you think
would be good for pre-work and so you're
 
would be good for pre-work and so you're
using it as a thought partner, right? In
 
using it as a thought partner, right? In
the same way that like if you or I were
 
the same way that like if you or I were
to sit down and I was on your team,
 
to sit down and I was on your team,
you'd come to me and be like, Nolan,
 
you'd come to me and be like, Nolan,
what do you think? Like what would be a
 
what do you think? Like what would be a
a good given like these are the agenda
 
a good given like these are the agenda
topics, what would be a good like uh you
 
topics, what would be a good like uh you
know thing we want people to fill out
 
know thing we want people to fill out
beforehand. Is that what you're doing?
 
beforehand. Is that what you're doing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so there's a there's another
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so there's a there's another
multi-dimensional nature that I think
 
multi-dimensional nature that I think
people don't use enough, which is so I
 
people don't use enough, which is so I
can do that. Then I can say, okay, here
 
can do that. Then I can say, okay, here
is the profile of the seven other
 
is the profile of the seven other
executives that are going to be in the
 
executives that are going to be in the
meeting. This is the CRO. he's been in
 
meeting. This is the CRO. he's been in
that role for a year and a half and this
 
that role for a year and a half and this
is what he did before. This is the
 
is what he did before. This is the
person, this is our GC, you know, this
 
person, this is our GC, you know, this
is our engineering and I can say and
 
is our engineering and I can say and
this is the type of thing they care
 
this is the type of thing they care
about. Now, what are they going to think
 
about. Now, what are they going to think
of this agenda? Give me what you think
 
of this agenda? Give me what you think
their feedback will be before I even
 
their feedback will be before I even
send it to them. And so like for example
 
send it to them. And so like for example
a chief people officer like I did this I
 
a chief people officer like I did this I
did this on another webinar like say
 
did this on another webinar like say
you're going to present in a budget
 
you're going to present in a budget
meeting you want to get funding for
 
meeting you want to get funding for
training you can be like what is the CFO
 
training you can be like what is the CFO
going to ask before you go to the
 
going to ask before you go to the
meeting with the CFO and it will adopt
 
meeting with the CFO and it will adopt
the persona of a CFO and criticize what
 
the persona of a CFO and criticize what
you put together. That's different from
 
you put together. That's different from
just asking Czech GPT. You're saying
 
just asking Czech GPT. You're saying
like how can I anticipate the functional
 
like how can I anticipate the functional
experts reaction to what I'm doing
 
experts reaction to what I'm doing
before you even go in? Like if you So
 
before you even go in? Like if you So
people that are doing that now showing
 
people that are doing that now showing
all the meetings like they're not just
 
all the meetings like they're not just
anticipating what this person is going
 
anticipating what this person is going
to think. They're getting like probably
 
to think. They're getting like probably
what any baseline person in that role
 
what any baseline person in that role
would think ahead of time. And a lot of
 
would think ahead of time. And a lot of
the meetings that we have in the today's
 
the meetings that we have in the today's
world before AI is you go to get what
 
world before AI is you go to get what
the marketing person thinks or what the
 
the marketing person thinks or what the
finance person thinks. Like you have to
 
finance person thinks. Like you have to
do this around the room socializing that
 
do this around the room socializing that
AI can really take you 80 yards
 
AI can really take you 80 yards
downfield before you even have a
 
downfield before you even have a
meeting. So the again the velocity can
 
meeting. So the again the velocity can
just really really step up.
 
just really really step up.
&gt;&gt; Do you talk about that? Go ahead, Kelly.
 
&gt;&gt; Do you talk about that? Go ahead, Kelly.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I just before we leave that, I I
 
&gt;&gt; Oh, I just before we leave that, I I
think the breakthrough that's been for
 
think the breakthrough that's been for
me, and I'll be honest, it hasn't been
 
me, and I'll be honest, it hasn't been
like it's been pretty recent, like
 
like it's been pretty recent, like
months. I'd say the breakthrough on this
 
months. I'd say the breakthrough on this
is that, and maybe others have have felt
 
is that, and maybe others have have felt
this too, is
 
this too, is
&gt;&gt; I think it could be very easy to to
 
&gt;&gt; I think it could be very easy to to
assume this is chat GPT is just going to
 
assume this is chat GPT is just going to
to uh to give you faster kind of drafts,
 
to uh to give you faster kind of drafts,
oneoff, if that makes sense. like I'm
 
oneoff, if that makes sense. like I'm
going to sit down and get my offset
 
going to sit down and get my offset
agenda.
 
agenda.
The breakthrough for me is like this
 
The breakthrough for me is like this
thing is an ongoing
 
thing is an ongoing
partner that that literally thinks like
 
partner that that literally thinks like
you and can spit stuff out with nuance
 
you and can spit stuff out with nuance
around your situation and it keeps
 
around your situation and it keeps
learning that. So like you don't just
 
learning that. So like you don't just
get a robotic thing out that's tapped.
 
get a robotic thing out that's tapped.
You get
 
You get
&gt;&gt; you get it with an angle, you know, and
 
&gt;&gt; you get it with an angle, you know, and
a lens on it that is specific to you and
 
a lens on it that is specific to you and
your team and your personality. And that
 
your team and your personality. And that
to me is like if people aren't aren't
 
to me is like if people aren't aren't
using this now, you're you're missing
 
using this now, you're you're missing
out because it's not some generic thing.
 
out because it's not some generic thing.
It literally is like living and
 
It literally is like living and
breathing and dynamic as you continue to
 
breathing and dynamic as you continue to
grow.
 
grow.
&gt;&gt; But that that requires work. That
 
&gt;&gt; But that that requires work. That
requires work though, right Brian from
 
requires work though, right Brian from
your side in order to provide it the
 
your side in order to provide it the
context. So how do you provide it that
 
context. So how do you provide it that
context? Are you just like
 
context? Are you just like
&gt;&gt; new new chat every time or do you have
 
&gt;&gt; new new chat every time or do you have
like a custom GPT with all of this
 
like a custom GPT with all of this
history saved?
 
history saved?
&gt;&gt; Uh I have custom GPTs for things that I
 
&gt;&gt; Uh I have custom GPTs for things that I
do all the time
 
do all the time
&gt;&gt; but I also use just quick it's how I
 
&gt;&gt; but I also use just quick it's how I
kind of experiment with different ones.
 
kind of experiment with different ones.
Um, like if I just have a random It's
 
Um, like if I just have a random It's
almost like sometimes when you just
 
almost like sometimes when you just
Google something, you just see an
 
Google something, you just see an
answer. Like that's okay for for
 
answer. Like that's okay for for
sometimes. But I It's interesting.
 
sometimes. But I It's interesting.
That's actually one thing we talked
 
That's actually one thing we talked
about in training too. I think we have
 
about in training too. I think we have
to unlearn Google, you know, like Google
 
to unlearn Google, you know, like Google
and I worked with Google for a long
 
and I worked with Google for a long
time. It's it was built on speed. Like
 
time. It's it was built on speed. Like
you give it a word and it gives you an
 
you give it a word and it gives you an
answer in milliseconds. It would tell
 
answer in milliseconds. It would tell
you that's took like less than one
 
you that's took like less than one
billionth of a millisecond to get you
 
billionth of a millisecond to get you
response. In Chacht these there's the
 
response. In Chacht these there's the
same interface. It's this blank page
 
same interface. It's this blank page
with a text box. So, we're used to just
 
with a text box. So, we're used to just
hitting send fast. And Nolan, to your
 
hitting send fast. And Nolan, to your
point, you actually want to take a long
 
point, you actually want to take a long
time to to set up your teammate. Again,
 
time to to set up your teammate. Again,
that's where the teammate versus tool
 
that's where the teammate versus tool
distinction for me was really powerful
 
distinction for me was really powerful
because I wanted to make sure I had the
 
because I wanted to make sure I had the
right partner then work where when you
 
right partner then work where when you
just open up the browser, you're like,
 
just open up the browser, you're like,
let's go. I got I got stuff to do. Like,
 
let's go. I got I got stuff to do. Like,
just give me the freaking answer. And
 
just give me the freaking answer. And
so, that's when you get the generic GPT
 
so, that's when you get the generic GPT
responses, like you're doing a Google
 
responses, like you're doing a Google
search with it. And I think this is
 
search with it. And I think this is
where a lot of people just run out of
 
where a lot of people just run out of
room. They they just are just doing the
 
room. They they just are just doing the
quick version. And I can also tell right
 
quick version. And I can also tell right
away when someone's super proud they're
 
away when someone's super proud they're
learning chat GBT and no one I know you
 
learning chat GBT and no one I know you
you can tell someone's like
 
you can tell someone's like
&gt;&gt; this is obviously cut and pasted from
 
&gt;&gt; this is obviously cut and pasted from
whatever you put in.
 
whatever you put in.
&gt;&gt; AI slop, right? There's a term for it.
 
&gt;&gt; AI slop, right? There's a term for it.
It's AI slop. Yeah. But
 
It's AI slop. Yeah. But
&gt;&gt; AI slop is not promise.
 
&gt;&gt; AI slop is not promise.
&gt;&gt; No. But what you're doing though to use
 
&gt;&gt; No. But what you're doing though to use
to pull the the new teammate analogy
 
to pull the the new teammate analogy
further is you're onboarding it.
 
further is you're onboarding it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's what you're doing. And and what's
 
&gt;&gt; That's what you're doing. And and what's
really interesting for for HR people,
 
really interesting for for HR people,
like I'm actually like I don't give a
 
like I'm actually like I don't give a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about onboarding. Like I'd like I'm
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about onboarding. Like I'd like I'm
just like throw people in the deep end
 
just like throw people in the deep end
of the pool is typically how I've done
 
of the pool is typically how I've done
it in the past. But a lot of a lot of
 
it in the past. But a lot of a lot of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I take from HR folks is like, "No,
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I take from HR folks is like, "No,
no, no, you got to have an amazing
 
no, no, you got to have an amazing
onboarding process." And this actually
 
onboarding process." And this actually
should speak their language super well,
 
should speak their language super well,
which is you need to onboard your new AI
 
which is you need to onboard your new AI
teammate. And you need to invest the
 
teammate. And you need to invest the
time to do that in the same way that you
 
time to do that in the same way that you
pedantically talk to those managers and
 
pedantically talk to those managers and
say, "Well, how can you expect them to
 
say, "Well, how can you expect them to
be successful if you're not spending
 
be successful if you're not spending
time on the onboarding process?"
 
time on the onboarding process?"
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's again, I said
 
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's again, I said
twice, right? The teammate mental model
 
twice, right? The teammate mental model
helps so much because you think about
 
helps so much because you think about
how you interact with it differently
 
how you interact with it differently
than something that's in a browser. And
 
than something that's in a browser. And
then you then you start to see the see
 
then you then you start to see the see
the return. You know, like Kelly, back
 
the return. You know, like Kelly, back
to your specifics question. Every unless
 
to your specifics question. Every unless
you came up through compensation, I
 
you came up through compensation, I
don't know how chief people officers
 
don't know how chief people officers
don't have their own high-powered custom
 
don't have their own high-powered custom
GPT around compensation. It's such a
 
GPT around compensation. It's such a
technical domain that you need to
 
technical domain that you need to
understand, especially as a public
 
understand, especially as a public
company and like how many freaking comp
 
company and like how many freaking comp
questions you ask your comp person that
 
questions you ask your comp person that
are like fundamental questions. What's
 
are like fundamental questions. What's
the difference between, you know,
 
the difference between, you know,
performance-based RSUs and RSUs? Like,
 
performance-based RSUs and RSUs? Like,
how does this work? What do I need to
 
how does this work? What do I need to
know about this? this sounds really
 
know about this? this sounds really
technical like you can just hardwire
 
technical like you can just hardwire
that and then stop bothering your team
 
that and then stop bothering your team
with these questions. They will they
 
with these questions. They will they
will feed you the technical.
 
will feed you the technical.
&gt;&gt; So like the fork in the road that I'm
 
&gt;&gt; So like the fork in the road that I'm
hearing very clearly and we've said the
 
hearing very clearly and we've said the
fork in the road is the work you have to
 
fork in the road is the work you have to
put into it. It's a go slow to go fast
 
put into it. It's a go slow to go fast
&gt;&gt; situation and go faster.
 
&gt;&gt; situation and go faster.
You know, joke I've heard is like, geez,
 
You know, joke I've heard is like, geez,
I took more time writing these freaking
 
I took more time writing these freaking
prompts in here to get this email than
 
prompts in here to get this email than
it would have taken me to write the
 
it would have taken me to write the
email. But the forest through the trees
 
email. But the forest through the trees
point is that you're onboarding this
 
point is that you're onboarding this
thing to go faster later.
 
thing to go faster later.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a

&gt;&gt; I must admit, I used to believe that AI

The other thing is like as a say you
 
The other thing is like as a say you
start a new role as a chief people
 
start a new role as a chief people
officer and the people that work for you
 
officer and the people that work for you
like they need help understanding how
 
like they need help understanding how
you like this work and how you want to
 
you like this work and how you want to
see things and everyone will you'll take
 
see things and everyone will you'll take
the time to do that. That's kind of the
 
the time to do that. That's kind of the
same mindset with with AI. You don't
 
same mindset with with AI. You don't
expect a brand new person who starts on
 
expect a brand new person who starts on
day one to understand how to work with
 
day one to understand how to work with
you. So I think applying that lens will
 
you. So I think applying that lens will
will really help. The other thing is you
 
will really help. The other thing is you
can literally use the tool to create the
 
can literally use the tool to create the
GPT.
 
GPT.
Like I didn't my my comp GPT is like
 
Like I didn't my my comp GPT is like
three pages long. Like I didn't write
 
three pages long. Like I didn't write
the three pages. I started like anyone
 
the three pages. I started like anyone
else would be like hey can you be like a
 
else would be like hey can you be like a
comp partner to me? You know and then
 
comp partner to me? You know and then
I'm like actually can you write out what
 
I'm like actually can you write out what
an amazing prompt for a compensation
 
an amazing prompt for a compensation
expert would be? I'm a public company. I
 
expert would be? I'm a public company. I
have this many employees in this many
 
have this many employees in this many
countries. Like what are all the things
 
countries. Like what are all the things
that should be in there? And then it
 
that should be in there? And then it
will tell you how to code itself. Again,
 
will tell you how to code itself. Again,
that happens so fast. So in the old
 
that happens so fast. So in the old
world, you're thinking, I got to spend
 
world, you're thinking, I got to spend
an hour thinking about how to come up
 
an hour thinking about how to come up
with the right instructions. It will
 
with the right instructions. It will
literally create the instructions and
 
literally create the instructions and
you can refine them.
 
you can refine them.
&gt;&gt; Now you that's been my learning. That's
 
&gt;&gt; Now you that's been my learning. That's
been my learning in the last like I'd
 
been my learning in the last like I'd
say like 30 days is exactly that, which
 
say like 30 days is exactly that, which
is just like instead of me spending all
 
is just like instead of me spending all
this time on prompt engineering, just
 
this time on prompt engineering, just
ask it to do it for you, right? And it's
 
ask it to do it for you, right? And it's
so so much easier uh that way. It's
 
so so much easier uh that way. It's
crazy that that's like the that's the
 
crazy that that's like the that's the
huge shortcut that I've experienced
 
huge shortcut that I've experienced
recently. So Brian, go back to this
 
recently. So Brian, go back to this
exact offsite. So all right, you you
 
exact offsite. So all right, you you
have your custom GPT. You fed it all of
 
have your custom GPT. You fed it all of
the context from uh these live
 
the context from uh these live
conversations which you're having in
 
conversations which you're having in
which you're taking the transcripts and
 
which you're taking the transcripts and
dropping them in. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that.
 
dropping them in. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that.
Then you're also taking like the uh the
 
Then you're also taking like the uh the
players in the in the meeting. So all
 
players in the in the meeting. So all
the execs, their backgrounds, any
 
the execs, their backgrounds, any
specific contexts on them. Love that.
 
specific contexts on them. Love that.
Then you get this like output. So walk
 
Then you get this like output. So walk
me through the because you're you're
 
me through the because you're you're
testing gamma and you're doing all sorts
 
testing gamma and you're doing all sorts
of stuff on you and I have talked about
 
of stuff on you and I have talked about
this.
 
this.
&gt;&gt; Well, talk to me about the output phase
 
&gt;&gt; Well, talk to me about the output phase
and then what are you doing?
 
and then what are you doing?
&gt;&gt; So the well one I haven't done it yet.
 
&gt;&gt; So the well one I haven't done it yet.
I'm going to do it at two. But what what
 
I'm going to do it at two. But what what
I'm probably going to do is it'll give
 
I'm probably going to do is it'll give
me cut and pasteable content. Okay,
 
me cut and pasteable content. Okay,
here's an agenda with times and and I'll
 
here's an agenda with times and and I'll
I'll kind of tweak it. I really love
 
I'll kind of tweak it. I really love
Gamma as a product, too, because I've I
 
Gamma as a product, too, because I've I
am terrible at making slides and I have
 
am terrible at making slides and I have
lost so much of my career to just trying
 
lost so much of my career to just trying
to make slides look presentable and I
 
to make slides look presentable and I
hate it and I I hate that it's an
 
hate it and I I hate that it's an
expectation that they have to look good.
 
expectation that they have to look good.
I understand why, but like it's just
 
I understand why, but like it's just
it's been brutal for me. And Gamma for
 
it's been brutal for me. And Gamma for
me, Gamma.app
 
me, Gamma.app
is like you can literally just dump in
 
is like you can literally just dump in
text and it gives you slides. And the
 
text and it gives you slides. And the
slides are great. And I'm sure the font
 
slides are great. And I'm sure the font
should be a little different, but it is
 
should be a little different, but it is
it is ready to rock. I can walk into a
 
it is ready to rock. I can walk into a
room within minutes of dropping it in
 
room within minutes of dropping it in
there. So that's how you know I don't
 
there. So that's how you know I don't
know we'll be using slides for the
 
know we'll be using slides for the
offsite. I'll probably send out like a
 
offsite. I'll probably send out like a
Google doc. But if I were if I thought
 
Google doc. But if I were if I thought
we needed slides, I would say here are
 
we needed slides, I would say here are
the slides for the present for the for
 
the slides for the present for the for
the meeting. So this is like a 30 or 45
 
the meeting. So this is like a 30 or 45
minute work session. I'm going to walk
 
minute work session. I'm going to walk
in with a bunch of threads and I'm going
 
in with a bunch of threads and I'm going
to walk out of this one-on-one with
 
to walk out of this one-on-one with
executive team. Here's what you need for
 
executive team. Here's what you need for
the offsite in two weeks. Done. And
 
the offsite in two weeks. Done. And
here's the slides we needed for the
 
here's the slides we needed for the
meeting. Can someone add this piece of
 
meeting. Can someone add this piece of
data that's not in there? It's all
 
data that's not in there? It's all
&gt;&gt; it's all ready to go. And again, again,
 
&gt;&gt; it's all ready to go. And again, again,
like a year ago, this would be, okay,
 
like a year ago, this would be, okay,
can someone help me with these freaking
 
can someone help me with these freaking
slides? I know it's Friday at 2, but I
 
slides? I know it's Friday at 2, but I
need slides for my peers now. Can you
 
need slides for my peers now. Can you
please
 
please
&gt;&gt; spend two hours of your time making them
 
&gt;&gt; spend two hours of your time making them
look good because it'll only take you
 
look good because it'll only take you
two hours. It'll take me eight,
 
two hours. It'll take me eight,
&gt;&gt; you know, and then I got to wait. It's
 
&gt;&gt; you know, and then I got to wait. It's
Friday to get it back to me. So, I'll
 
Friday to get it back to me. So, I'll
just send it Monday. Like that that that
 
just send it Monday. Like that that that
is where like the velocity really really
 
is where like the velocity really really
drops. Um because so much of work is
 
drops. Um because so much of work is
like okay let's end the meeting and then
 
like okay let's end the meeting and then
everyone just needs a week you know
 
everyone just needs a week you know
whatever the action item was you just
 
whatever the action item was you just
get a week
 
get a week
&gt;&gt; and half of this stuff you could
 
&gt;&gt; and half of this stuff you could
actually probably finish it in the
 
actually probably finish it in the
meeting with with you need in the
 
meeting with with you need in the
meeting it's like just don't go anywhere
 
meeting it's like just don't go anywhere
for 10 minutes just do this do this
 
for 10 minutes just do this do this
right now
 
right now
&gt;&gt; the expectations because I love gamma
 
&gt;&gt; the expectations because I love gamma
too and I'm kind of probably like early
 
too and I'm kind of probably like early
like I haven't spent enough time but
 
like I haven't spent enough time but
once you spend so much time in there and
 
once you spend so much time in there and
learning it it just becomes like
 
learning it it just becomes like
like it's it's like a it's like making
 
like it's it's like a it's like making
music it just works you know but you
 
music it just works you know but you
have to become capable around doing that
 
have to become capable around doing that
you can't just expect to download gamma
 
you can't just expect to download gamma
and like where's my presentation
 
and like where's my presentation
&gt;&gt; that's right
 
&gt;&gt; that's right
&gt;&gt; and I talked style you know recently
 
&gt;&gt; and I talked style you know recently
metav view and a lot of this stuff is
 
metav view and a lot of this stuff is
around human nature um
 
around human nature um
&gt;&gt; um like most things expectations etc so
 
&gt;&gt; um like most things expectations etc so
I guess my question on that Brian maybe
 
I guess my question on that Brian maybe
both of you right now this all seems
 
both of you right now this all seems
optional like generally right like
 
optional like generally right like
You're an early adopter. You're choosing
 
You're an early adopter. You're choosing
to do this. Like most people probably
 
to do this. Like most people probably
aren't
 
aren't
&gt;&gt; doing this at the level you're doing it.
 
&gt;&gt; doing this at the level you're doing it.
It it it is objectively optional right
 
It it it is objectively optional right
now. What happens two years from now
 
now. What happens two years from now
&gt;&gt; if you're not doing this? Is it still
 
&gt;&gt; if you're not doing this? Is it still
optional? Like you know what I mean?
 
optional? Like you know what I mean?
&gt;&gt; Again, I think I mentioned this the
 
&gt;&gt; Again, I think I mentioned this the
first time I came on this. I was a dotr,
 
first time I came on this. I was a dotr,
you know, I I recruited before the
 
you know, I I recruited before the
internet, you know, and so there were
 
internet, you know, and so there were
people who didn't who were recruiters in
 
people who didn't who were recruiters in
the late 90s that were like, I don't
 
the late 90s that were like, I don't
I've never had to use the internet now.
 
I've never had to use the internet now.
I've been doing this 20 years. Like why
 
I've been doing this 20 years. Like why
why would I need to start? And so like
 
why would I need to start? And so like
that's true. They kept their business
 
that's true. They kept their business
for a few years, late late 90s, early
 
for a few years, late late 90s, early
 
Can you imagine a recruiting firm today
 
Can you imagine a recruiting firm today
that doesn't use the internet
 
that doesn't use the internet
or by extension like where people don't
 
or by extension like where people don't
know how to use the internet? It's just
 
know how to use the internet? It's just
completely cannot exist 20 20 years
 
completely cannot exist 20 20 years
later, right? 25 years later. So I just
 
later, right? 25 years later. So I just
think it's similar. It's like in and you
 
think it's similar. It's like in and you
you draw that extension like I remember
 
you draw that extension like I remember
in the early part of my career people
 
in the early part of my career people
who couldn't type. Can you imagine not
 
who couldn't type. Can you imagine not
being able to type today? Like how would
 
being able to type today? Like how would
you do your job if you couldn't really
 
you do your job if you couldn't really
type? Like you were a slow typer. those
 
type? Like you were a slow typer. those
you you just wouldn't get into the
 
you you just wouldn't get into the
working the professional working world
 
working the professional working world
today if you can't use a keyboard like
 
today if you can't use a keyboard like
super efficiently. Now I think that
 
super efficiently. Now I think that
might go away. I think like talk to text
 
might go away. I think like talk to text
is coming and stuff like that. But but
 
is coming and stuff like that. But but
it's the same. I think it's it's it's
 
it's the same. I think it's it's it's
like relative comparison because it's
 
like relative comparison because it's
not knowing how to use any of these
 
not knowing how to use any of these
tools in any way five years from now is
 
tools in any way five years from now is
going to be such a limitation because it
 
going to be such a limitation because it
will become so embedded in so many ways
 
will become so embedded in so many ways
things get done. It's the It's the
 
things get done. It's the It's the
tension that all knowledge workers have,
 
tension that all knowledge workers have,
which is I have a task that I need to
 
which is I have a task that I need to
get done right now, but I also have this
 
get done right now, but I also have this
brand new technology that I need to
 
brand new technology that I need to
learn. And what people are doing is
 
learn. And what people are doing is
they're just going right to like, well,
 
they're just going right to like, well,
I have this task. I know how to do it.
 
I have this task. I know how to do it.
I'm going to do it the old way because
 
I'm going to do it the old way because
like I'm comfortable. That's really like
 
like I'm comfortable. That's really like
what's going on here is like people are
 
what's going on here is like people are
comfortable with their existing
 
comfortable with their existing
workflows.
 
workflows.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And this is this is where I've
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And this is this is where I've
been trying to like ring this bell like
 
been trying to like ring this bell like
really loud. Like this is like this is
 
really loud. Like this is like this is
like the dinosaurs like watching the
 
like the dinosaurs like watching the
asteroid coming and them being like
 
asteroid coming and them being like
cognizant of that thing and not trying
 
cognizant of that thing and not trying
to like build some sort of defense
 
to like build some sort of defense
system as it's coming towards them.
 
system as it's coming towards them.
That's what's happening right now. And
 
That's what's happening right now. And
so I keep saying like I think there's a
 
so I keep saying like I think there's a
mass extinction event happening. Um
 
mass extinction event happening. Um
because it's it's people who don't take
 
because it's it's people who don't take
the time to learn and follow their
 
the time to learn and follow their
curiosity. You have to be curious about
 
curiosity. You have to be curious about
this there. It's not it's it's I
 
this there. It's not it's it's I
disagree that it's optional. I I I think
 
disagree that it's optional. I I I think
it feels optional right now,
 
it feels optional right now,
&gt;&gt; but it's obviously not.
 
&gt;&gt; but it's obviously not.
&gt;&gt; Like clearly it is it is not optional.
 
&gt;&gt; Like clearly it is it is not optional.
It's coming. It's coming in the biggest
 
It's coming. It's coming in the biggest
way possible. And like you know, Brian
 
way possible. And like you know, Brian
just said he doesn't have an L &amp; D team.
 
just said he doesn't have an L &amp; D team.
Like he also just mentioned comp. Those
 
Like he also just mentioned comp. Those
are the two things I've been thinking
 
are the two things I've been thinking
about over the last 10 days, Brian. Like
 
about over the last 10 days, Brian. Like
those specific examples of it within the
 
those specific examples of it within the
people ops department, I think are at
 
people ops department, I think are at
the highest risk of AI coming for and
 
the highest risk of AI coming for and
it's not like taking jobs, but it's like
 
it's not like taking jobs, but it's like
not having as many humans,
 
not having as many humans,
&gt;&gt; right? It's just it's just not having as
 
&gt;&gt; right? It's just it's just not having as
many. I don't need as many if I'm using
 
many. I don't need as many if I'm using
the tools appropriately. Well, I think
 
the tools appropriately. Well, I think
again and this is a really important
 
again and this is a really important
distinction for us next door. I think a
 
distinction for us next door. I think a
person who's learning in public is the
 
person who's learning in public is the
CEO of Box. A Eron Levy is really really
 
CEO of Box. A Eron Levy is really really
good to follow
 
good to follow
&gt;&gt; and he his thing is like which I agree
 
&gt;&gt; and he his thing is like which I agree
with the magic isn't just automating the
 
with the magic isn't just automating the
workflow with AI. It's doing it's
 
workflow with AI. It's doing it's
creating workflows that couldn't have
 
creating workflows that couldn't have
existed before. So, when it comes to
 
existed before. So, when it comes to
comp, like I think everybody wishes a
 
comp, like I think everybody wishes a
comp person could sit with every single
 
comp person could sit with every single
manager for every single comp discussion
 
manager for every single comp discussion
decision that they have. We all wish we
 
decision that they have. We all wish we
could do that. You can't, you know, if
 
could do that. You can't, you know, if
you're in a comp cycle, you've got like
 
you're in a comp cycle, you've got like
two weeks to have 200 conversations, you
 
two weeks to have 200 conversations, you
know, or 500 conver like you you can't
 
know, or 500 conver like you you can't
do it. you can actually do this now
 
do it. you can actually do this now
where you could create like an AI comp
 
where you could create like an AI comp
partner and every single person could
 
partner and every single person could
have their own custom comp person in
 
have their own custom comp person in
every single conversation. So that's
 
every single conversation. So that's
contemplating like that's not
 
contemplating like that's not
conceivable to do with a the
 
conceivable to do with a the
bottlenecking of there's only so many
 
bottlenecking of there's only so many
comp people, you know, the same thing um
 
comp people, you know, the same thing um
the same thing as with onboarding,
 
the same thing as with onboarding,
right? Like we have to package
 
right? Like we have to package
onboarding as a program that all the new
 
onboarding as a program that all the new
hires go through it together as one
 
hires go through it together as one
thing because like there's only one
 
thing because like there's only one
onboarding team and so you have to
 
onboarding team and so you have to
generalize the content where you can now
 
generalize the content where you can now
like we're starting to experiment like
 
like we're starting to experiment like
how can you create each person's
 
how can you create each person's
custom-designed onboarding buddy that
 
custom-designed onboarding buddy that
gives them their job specific
 
gives them their job specific
information over their first 90 days.
 
information over their first 90 days.
Like you can't do that with people. You
 
Like you can't do that with people. You
would not hire someone to just do that
 
would not hire someone to just do that
job at that level of bespokeness. But
 
job at that level of bespokeness. But
now the onboarding team can think that
 
now the onboarding team can think that
way, you know. So I think that's where
 
way, you know. So I think that's where
that's why to's point it's important to
 
that's why to's point it's important to
be learning because it starts to create
 
be learning because it starts to create
those types of experiences for people
 
those types of experiences for people
teams that you just couldn't you're like
 
teams that you just couldn't you're like
we don't have the headcount just can't
 
we don't have the headcount just can't
even think about it and there should be
 
even think about it and there should be
urgency there. There should be real
 
urgency there. There should be real
urgency around this like you know and
 
urgency around this like you know and
this is the stuff to where it's like I
 
this is the stuff to where it's like I
everyone has uh competing priorities
 
everyone has uh competing priorities
like I got two kids you know like I got
 
like I got two kids you know like I got
two kids they're like right in prime
 
two kids they're like right in prime
time like you know six and five like I
 
time like you know six and five like I
want to be there I want to be around but
 
want to be there I want to be around but
like if I don't carve out a couple hours
 
like if I don't carve out a couple hours
per week and really spend time like
 
per week and really spend time like
learning this and like trying to apply
 
learning this and like trying to apply
it to my workflows then I know what's
 
it to my workflows then I know what's
coming for me which is my extinction
 
coming for me which is my extinction
moment and that's what I'm trying to
 
moment and that's what I'm trying to
avoid.
 
avoid.
Yeah. And I just I think it's also good
 
Yeah. And I just I think it's also good
to to understand that not everyone ticks
 
to to understand that not everyone ticks
that way. It's hard, you guys. Like I
 
that way. It's hard, you guys. Like I
&gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] found myself yesterday creating
 
&gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] found myself yesterday creating
slides and I was like, "Stop.
 
slides and I was like, "Stop.
&gt;&gt; Go to Gamma.
 
&gt;&gt; Go to Gamma.
&gt;&gt; Take an extra [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 24 minutes."
 
&gt;&gt; Take an extra [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 24 minutes."
&gt;&gt; Um, give it a whirl with, you know,
 
&gt;&gt; Um, give it a whirl with, you know,
giving myself permission to get out of
 
giving myself permission to get out of
it, right? That's that's the biggest
 
it, right? That's that's the biggest
thing for at least me and the others is
 
thing for at least me and the others is
you have to do it. You have to feel like
 
you have to do it. You have to feel like

hour a week and like show me how to
build these. I'm serious. Like um it's
 
build these. I'm serious. Like um it's
it is it's important. So
 
it is it's important. So
&gt;&gt; it's what the thing so you know I've
 
&gt;&gt; it's what the thing so you know I've
been working a while and that this has
 
been working a while and that this has
disrupted my since I became like an
 
disrupted my since I became like an
executive seuite. This has disrupted how
 
executive seuite. This has disrupted how
I spend my time on a weekly basis more
 
I spend my time on a weekly basis more
dramatically than like I guess work from
 
dramatically than like I guess work from

home. I guess going to work from home
was like a major disruption too. So, but
 
was like a major disruption too. So, but
like my my time like many execs, my time
 
like my my time like many execs, my time
would be like 13 to 15 meetings a day
 
would be like 13 to 15 meetings a day
just freaking maxed all all day and that
 
just freaking maxed all all day and that
that's how I got maximum leverage. But
 
that's how I got maximum leverage. But
now these spaces where I'm using this
 
now these spaces where I'm using this
tool is creating equal leverage. You
 
tool is creating equal leverage. You
know, I have to kill meetings so I can
 
know, I have to kill meetings so I can
get this time now, which I wouldn't have
 
get this time now, which I wouldn't have
felt like that a year ago. It would have
 
felt like that a year ago. It would have
been like, oh, I got to figure this out.
 
been like, oh, I got to figure this out.
But now I know I need it to get the
 
But now I know I need it to get the
stuff done I need to get done. Um, it's
 
stuff done I need to get done. Um, it's
it's kind of found its way. I really
 
it's kind of found its way. I really
shap and I think we're
 
shap and I think we're
&gt;&gt; totally I mean I think we're probably
 
&gt;&gt; totally I mean I think we're probably
close to wrapping up but my if I have
 
close to wrapping up but my if I have
one takeaway out out of this and I
 
one takeaway out out of this and I
actually it was a takeaway I didn't I

the quality that of your output and
making AI part of the workflow for the
 
making AI part of the workflow for the
