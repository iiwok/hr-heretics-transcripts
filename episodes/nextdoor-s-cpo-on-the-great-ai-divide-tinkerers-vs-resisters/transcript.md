# Nextdoor’s CPO on “The Great AI Divide”: Tinkerers vs Resisters

## Transcript

 
[Applause]
[Music]
 
All right. What's happening everyone?
Welcome back to another fun-filled
session of HR Heretics. It's Friday,
right boys? It's Friday.
&gt;&gt; Um, I can't believe it. We have Brian
Power back on the show, everyone joining
us today. Um, we had dinner a few weeks
ago, Brian, and Brian and I sat next to
each other. Thank you, Nolan, for making
that happen. And we were talking about
AI. We were talking about,
you know, all the fanfare and all the
all the stuff out there around it, the
reality of how you actually do this
day-to-day. And a lot of people we've
been talking to recently, Nolan, and
I've been personally talking to high
level, right? people, officers,
operators, a lot of them have been
saying, "I actually don't do anything
with AI during the day because I don't
have time. I'm actually building stuff.
It's a distraction. It takes time away
from that." And I've heard that a lot.
And Brian at dinner was like, "I'm the
opposite. I literally just tinker most
of the day. I carve out time for it. I
think that we own this strategy, not
just for ourselves, for the company."
And I was like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that is a
huge chasm between what I've been
hearing and what you're saying." And I
want to I want to understand what that
looks like and feels like with you
dayto-day. And then we're going to end
with our favorite corporate lingo, which
is a new fun-filled rapid fire round. I
put in here, which is the worst company
phrases you're hearing out in the wild.
We all hear them. We all say them. I'm
guilty. And we're going to make fun of
some of them. So, let's kick off. Brian,
so tell us about what you're doing at
Next Door with AI, how you think about
it, you know, in general, and we'll jump
in here with some some uh conversation.
&gt;&gt; Sounds great. Well, first, thanks for
having me back. Repeat guest. I feel
honored. I'm a huge fan of the
franchise. If there's merch, I want to
buy it. I mentioned to you all, I I
consume this on my commute in and you
know, I basically demanded you let me
back in because I' I've been talking to
you in my car and you can't hear me. So,
it's great we can all get get together
live on this.
&gt;&gt; No, you're not the first person that's
told us. Like, I yell at you in my car.
What What is that? What do you yell?
&gt;&gt; That's the right emotion. That's That's
the right emotion we want.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Is what Nolan say make you scream?
Like, what what do you what do you
&gt;&gt; So, both of you are offenders. I think
the brand you've developed is excellent.
You you you come with real opinions on
things that are that are happening and
and sometimes my yells are absolutely
this is so right. Why don't more people
say this? And sometimes I want to be
like, you're crazy. There's no way.
&gt;&gt; You're the dumbest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people on
planet Earth. Nolan Kelly.
&gt;&gt; I think that's why I love this podcast
and I I think, you know, I think other
people do too cuz so so the I think it's
great the universe of people focused
podcast has grown so much since co and I
think the communities sharing and
learning is all is all good. But um I
like you're a little more unvarnished
and that's that's my jam. I really
appreciate it. So, keep it up.
&gt;&gt; I think the last
&gt;&gt; I was say I think the last time that I
was on, we talked a little bit about AI.
This was months ago, you know, and I
think that lots is lots really happened
&gt;&gt; with AI and AI in the workplace. And um
so I think, you know, outside of Next
Door, I'm certainly feeling like
resistance. There's a lot of people who
are like this thing didn't out of the
box make us all superhuman, so false
advertising. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or to your point, Kelly, people like,
"Okay, I gotta try this." And then it
doesn't
&gt;&gt; there's all these things that go wrong.
It doesn't work. And then you're like,
"Okay, now I'm behind. Now I got to go
do the stuff I was supposed to do today
and and I lost an hour, so I can't do
that again." And that overhead of having
to learn. I I think in general people
are saying um you know, everyone's
talking about AI bubble. Every freaking
company is now selling AI. Their product
is now AI. So it's just it's just it's
bubbly. It's and it's hot. Um, but I I
think the resistance has come from
people know how to do their jobs and
they're trying to do it and trying to
have people do their job in a different
way takes time and you might not figure
it out as you get into it. So that's
just in general going to slow slow
things down and people are going to go
back to doing what they're doing. And I
do think the narrative like the some of
the CEO takes are just so cringey, you
know, and and I think that this is
there's a real fear in a lot of
workplaces that you're being asked to
figure out how to rem remove your job
and people are kind of like why would I
why would I do that? You know, I
certainly I don't I don't think we have
that issue at Next Door because we're
very much trying to activate the energy
to use it to grow each other, our
opportunity. It's like how can someone
do the work of more people versus how
can we do something with less people.
That's that's been our vantage point
with with AI. Um and inside of of Next
Door um you know I've been I've been
here for seven years and I'm very lucky
that my team you know my direct reports
we've all worked together for like at
least 5 years. So, we have the benefit
of having been together through a lot um
to cover just call it kind of normal
people team stuff, but that also lets us
work in new areas because we're not
trying to cover gaps or building going
through team building like we're we have
a little bit of an advantage in that
regards. Um but that I've tried to take
advantage of that opportunity for all of
us to really push us to try to figure
this stuff out really going back now a
year. So um internally next door I'm the
the you know the leader of the cross
functional effort to bring AI into the
workplace. We call it project neighbor
neighbor spelled N AI B O R. We love
neighbors at Next Door and we fused it
with AI and I'm working really closely
with our IS and IT teams uh and our
engineering teams and we've really just
tried to build the internal community
around this and I think you know what
you're getting at Kelly is the early
curve. There was an article in Hacker
News that talked about this is that
engineers actually became less
productive when they first started using
AI but then when they learn how to use
it they can become more productive. But
you hit this initial wall until people
stop. And I I thought that was a good
example of what everybody really runs
into because I definitely lost a lot of
time a few months ago,
but now I feel like uh how we do things
as a team, how I set up my day, how I
try to use it, I can't imagine not
having these tools available, you know?
&gt;&gt; So give us give us that rundown though,
Brian. Like what is it like daytoday?
Like how do you think about this? And
then broadly how are you thinking about
you know
instituting this AI process across an
entire company when there is resistance.
&gt;&gt; So I'll use a specific example of what I
did at the beginning of the year that I
think helped me help galvanize some of
the learning. So we one of the best
practices you should do is just offer
training. You know people don't know how
to use it. So you should train them on
AI and you could just download you can
just use stuff from OpenAI's website or
LinkedIn learning like there's just
stuff out there to get the basics going
and you should push that and say people
you should take training. So um we don't
have a a dedicated L &amp; D team at Next
Door and I wanted to kind of create the
training and so I normally historically
would have partnered with a facilitator
or a program designer to create a
training. I didn't have one. So I forced
myself to use chat GPT to develop the
training, right? And what I found was it
actually that what had been historically
like an iterative process with a program
designer was happening at such a higher
velocity that I was able to kind of get
to the content I wanted to train in a
much shorter amount of time than I would
have had with working sessions with like
an L &amp; D. And I've had some great L &amp; D
practitioners, but just the the nature
of the immediacy of me kind of get to
okay, here's what's going to be on the
slides and here's going to be a class
was like really kind of that was like a
first real insight for me to develop
this course. And then I realized like I
can just teach this course. Like all I
got to do now is just show up. And so I
think a lot of chief people officers
would like to do more things like
facilitate or present or teach but like
the pre-work time allocation is what
prevents you from doing it. So I just
decided, hey, I this teaching will help
me learn too. So I kind of led our AI
fundamentals training that I I created
by kind of borrowing from other
companies and really made it our own.
And so one of the first insights that I
think is really important that's part of
this training is you have to start to
think about a product like Claude or
Chat GBT as a teammate, not as a tool.
And this kind of came to life with me
when I was making a training with China
GBT in the same way that I would have
made a training with a program manager
in the past. I was like, "Oh, I kind of
get it." Where most software is like a
tool, you know? You're just kind of like
it spits back data to you. But the more
I invested in creating the teammate and
treating it like a teammate, the more I
got out of it. And so this led to
something Kelly and I were talking about
at dinner. I've actually now changed my
calendar to where I have one-on- ones
that it's called one-on-one with a
certain GPT that I've made. So like that
AI teammate and then what that used to
be like I'll block time right like
creative time or work time like people
use that type of thing but there was
this shift when I set it up like an
actual one-on-one with a specific type
of GBT that is meant for a certain type
of problem. It became this like
one-on-one working session that was way
more focused and would really start to
produce outcomes.
&gt;&gt; That I'm gonna stop there that
&gt;&gt; that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool. So, like I don't
know about you all listening, but when
Brian just said, "I set up one-on ones
with Chad GBT," I was thinking like
you're you're setting up one-on- ones
with a human and you're going to talk
about chat GBT. Like, no, you literally
are booking time with these agents just
to tinker with them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, like I have 45 minutes later
today. And so, what it's like when you
have one-on- ones with your directs, you
each have a list of the stuff you're
going to go over when you get to that
one-on-one. And so I'm kind of
dedicating this space to a certain type
of thing I want to work on later the
same way I would with someone on my
team. And but that is very different
from like experimenting with AI during
like a work time. We're working.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is where the rubber hits the
road on a lot of this stuff right now in
my opinion where it's like that's great
you're what exactly are you going to do
later? First of all, kudos to you Friday
afternoon with Chad GBT. Like that is
that is commitment. Hey everyone, we'll
be right back in a moment after a word
from our sponsors. On this show, we tell
the truth about HR. And one of my
favorite conversations we've had was
with Melanie Nanho. She put it so
simply. HR isn't about optimizing for
compliance. It's optimizing for people,
for culture, trust, and workplaces where
folks actually want to stay. That's why
I'm such a fan of what Melanie and her
team at Athena are building. She was
brutally honest about it. So Athena,
we're a compliance company which uh
let's just put it out there that sounds
pretty boring if you think about it
right okay harassment prevention
training not very exciting right we are
very lucky in that we are in the HR tech
space that's required right harassment
prevention training is not really
optional you need it the question is who
are you going to use for it
&gt;&gt; exactly you're doing this training
whether you want to or not but here's
what she told us about the impact
&gt;&gt; the amount of impact that I've been able
to have from the HR perspective has been
just huge huge. It's phenomenal. We're
doing all these amazing things that
quite frankly too many companies don't
do because they don't understand the
power of their HR team.
&gt;&gt; Instead of boring check the box training
that everyone hates, Athena delivers
content that's modern and impactful.
We're talking 200 plus courses in 100
plus languages with a 93% learner
positivity rating to back it up. They
take on all the tough topics, harassment
prevention, workplace violence
prevention, code of conduct, and make
them actually engaging. And for HR, it's
effortless. Training runs on autopilot
with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
done right, like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

So very specifically, we next door we
have a leadership offsite, the executive
team in two weeks and I'm putting
together the agenda and I was just in
New York this week talking to a bunch of
the people that will be at the offsite.
So I've got kind of their input on how
we're going to run some of the sessions
and now I'm going to pump it into CHBT
and like turbocharge the agenda that
will be like we're going to send out the
pre-work a week before the offsite. So,
normally that would be much longer, but
now because my GPT has history with me
as a chief people officer and other
products I've worked on at Next Door,
like I can say, "Hey, this is this is
what we're going to be discussing." Like
I I want help me figure out how what
should people what should the template
look like that I want the people leading
the discussions in advance to fill in.
That will be like minutes versus just
cut and paste what we did last time, you
know? And you can really quickly now the
familiar the familiar nature of it now
means I can I know what it will do well
and not do well. So we're going to have
not like oh he obviously used chat GPT
to generate the agenda, right? Like I'm
just going to use it as like my co-pilot
to create a great agenda for our
offsite. And that's one of the things
I'm do.
&gt;&gt; The thing there what you're saying
though which is really interesting is
that you're you're meeting with people
to inform what you're going to use as
your inputs. Are you recording those
conversations, Brian?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, then I'd say the default is to
try to just to transcribe the notes also
as a way to just
&gt;&gt; I'm terrible at taking notes now, right?
Like,
&gt;&gt; and like it's so much lost. It's so much
lost. So, just having the default be
like, we should probably not record
maybe one or two things, but we really
should record as much as we can because
it's going to make better.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, but then I'm assuming what
you're doing is then you're taking the
transcript
&gt;&gt; of all of those conversations. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; you're pumping in those transcripts
&gt;&gt; and then you're saying I have a I have
an exact offsite in two weeks. What I
want help with is setting the agenda and
then for each agenda item like the
things we really need to discuss that
need to be on there and then what do you
think should be what what do you think
would be good for pre-work and so you're
using it as a thought partner, right? In
the same way that like if you or I were
to sit down and I was on your team,
you'd come to me and be like, Nolan,
what do you think? Like what would be a
a good given like these are the agenda
topics, what would be a good like uh you
know thing we want people to fill out
beforehand. Is that what you're doing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so there's a there's another
multi-dimensional nature that I think
people don't use enough, which is so I
can do that. Then I can say, okay, here
is the profile of the seven other
executives that are going to be in the
meeting. This is the CRO. he's been in
that role for a year and a half and this
is what he did before. This is the
person, this is our GC, you know, this
is our engineering and I can say and
this is the type of thing they care
about. Now, what are they going to think
of this agenda? Give me what you think
their feedback will be before I even
send it to them. And so like for example
a chief people officer like I did this I
did this on another webinar like say
you're going to present in a budget
meeting you want to get funding for
training you can be like what is the CFO
going to ask before you go to the
meeting with the CFO and it will adopt
the persona of a CFO and criticize what
you put together. That's different from
just asking Czech GPT. You're saying
like how can I anticipate the functional
experts reaction to what I'm doing
before you even go in? Like if you So
people that are doing that now showing
all the meetings like they're not just
anticipating what this person is going
to think. They're getting like probably
what any baseline person in that role
would think ahead of time. And a lot of
the meetings that we have in the today's
world before AI is you go to get what
the marketing person thinks or what the
finance person thinks. Like you have to
do this around the room socializing that
AI can really take you 80 yards
downfield before you even have a
meeting. So the again the velocity can
just really really step up.
&gt;&gt; Do you talk about that? Go ahead, Kelly.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I just before we leave that, I I
think the breakthrough that's been for
me, and I'll be honest, it hasn't been
like it's been pretty recent, like
months. I'd say the breakthrough on this
is that, and maybe others have have felt
this too, is
&gt;&gt; I think it could be very easy to to
assume this is chat GPT is just going to
to uh to give you faster kind of drafts,
oneoff, if that makes sense. like I'm
going to sit down and get my offset
agenda.
The breakthrough for me is like this
thing is an ongoing
partner that that literally thinks like
you and can spit stuff out with nuance
around your situation and it keeps
learning that. So like you don't just
get a robotic thing out that's tapped.
You get
&gt;&gt; you get it with an angle, you know, and
a lens on it that is specific to you and
your team and your personality. And that
to me is like if people aren't aren't
using this now, you're you're missing
out because it's not some generic thing.
It literally is like living and
breathing and dynamic as you continue to
grow.
&gt;&gt; But that that requires work. That
requires work though, right Brian from
your side in order to provide it the
context. So how do you provide it that
context? Are you just like
&gt;&gt; new new chat every time or do you have
like a custom GPT with all of this
history saved?
&gt;&gt; Uh I have custom GPTs for things that I
do all the time
&gt;&gt; but I also use just quick it's how I
kind of experiment with different ones.
Um, like if I just have a random It's
almost like sometimes when you just
Google something, you just see an
answer. Like that's okay for for
sometimes. But I It's interesting.
That's actually one thing we talked
about in training too. I think we have
to unlearn Google, you know, like Google
and I worked with Google for a long
time. It's it was built on speed. Like
you give it a word and it gives you an
answer in milliseconds. It would tell
you that's took like less than one
billionth of a millisecond to get you
response. In Chacht these there's the
same interface. It's this blank page
with a text box. So, we're used to just
hitting send fast. And Nolan, to your
point, you actually want to take a long
time to to set up your teammate. Again,
that's where the teammate versus tool
distinction for me was really powerful
because I wanted to make sure I had the
right partner then work where when you
just open up the browser, you're like,
let's go. I got I got stuff to do. Like,
just give me the freaking answer. And
so, that's when you get the generic GPT
responses, like you're doing a Google
search with it. And I think this is
where a lot of people just run out of
room. They they just are just doing the
quick version. And I can also tell right
away when someone's super proud they're
learning chat GBT and no one I know you
you can tell someone's like
&gt;&gt; this is obviously cut and pasted from
whatever you put in.
&gt;&gt; AI slop, right? There's a term for it.
It's AI slop. Yeah. But
&gt;&gt; AI slop is not promise.
&gt;&gt; No. But what you're doing though to use
to pull the the new teammate analogy
further is you're onboarding it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's what you're doing. And and what's
really interesting for for HR people,
like I'm actually like I don't give a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about onboarding. Like I'd like I'm
just like throw people in the deep end
of the pool is typically how I've done
it in the past. But a lot of a lot of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I take from HR folks is like, "No,
no, no, you got to have an amazing
onboarding process." And this actually
should speak their language super well,
which is you need to onboard your new AI
teammate. And you need to invest the
time to do that in the same way that you
pedantically talk to those managers and
say, "Well, how can you expect them to
be successful if you're not spending
time on the onboarding process?"
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's again, I said
twice, right? The teammate mental model
helps so much because you think about
how you interact with it differently
than something that's in a browser. And
then you then you start to see the see
the return. You know, like Kelly, back
to your specifics question. Every unless
you came up through compensation, I
don't know how chief people officers
don't have their own high-powered custom
GPT around compensation. It's such a
technical domain that you need to
understand, especially as a public
company and like how many freaking comp
questions you ask your comp person that
are like fundamental questions. What's
the difference between, you know,
performance-based RSUs and RSUs? Like,
how does this work? What do I need to
know about this? this sounds really
technical like you can just hardwire
that and then stop bothering your team
with these questions. They will they
will feed you the technical.
&gt;&gt; So like the fork in the road that I'm
hearing very clearly and we've said the
fork in the road is the work you have to
put into it. It's a go slow to go fast
&gt;&gt; situation and go faster.
You know, joke I've heard is like, geez,
I took more time writing these freaking
prompts in here to get this email than
it would have taken me to write the
email. But the forest through the trees
point is that you're onboarding this
thing to go faster later.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
&gt;&gt; I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talented signal fire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metave is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. MeteView changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metaview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metave. Head over to metav.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
The other thing is like as a say you
start a new role as a chief people
officer and the people that work for you
like they need help understanding how
you like this work and how you want to
see things and everyone will you'll take
the time to do that. That's kind of the
same mindset with with AI. You don't
expect a brand new person who starts on
day one to understand how to work with
you. So I think applying that lens will
will really help. The other thing is you
can literally use the tool to create the
GPT.
Like I didn't my my comp GPT is like
three pages long. Like I didn't write
the three pages. I started like anyone
else would be like hey can you be like a
comp partner to me? You know and then
I'm like actually can you write out what
an amazing prompt for a compensation
expert would be? I'm a public company. I
have this many employees in this many
countries. Like what are all the things
that should be in there? And then it
will tell you how to code itself. Again,
that happens so fast. So in the old
world, you're thinking, I got to spend
an hour thinking about how to come up
with the right instructions. It will
literally create the instructions and
you can refine them.
&gt;&gt; Now you that's been my learning. That's
been my learning in the last like I'd
say like 30 days is exactly that, which
is just like instead of me spending all
this time on prompt engineering, just
ask it to do it for you, right? And it's
so so much easier uh that way. It's
crazy that that's like the that's the
huge shortcut that I've experienced
recently. So Brian, go back to this
exact offsite. So all right, you you
have your custom GPT. You fed it all of
the context from uh these live
conversations which you're having in
which you're taking the transcripts and
dropping them in. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that.
Then you're also taking like the uh the
players in the in the meeting. So all
the execs, their backgrounds, any
specific contexts on them. Love that.
Then you get this like output. So walk
me through the because you're you're
testing gamma and you're doing all sorts
of stuff on you and I have talked about
this.
&gt;&gt; Well, talk to me about the output phase
and then what are you doing?
&gt;&gt; So the well one I haven't done it yet.
I'm going to do it at two. But what what
I'm probably going to do is it'll give
me cut and pasteable content. Okay,
here's an agenda with times and and I'll
I'll kind of tweak it. I really love
Gamma as a product, too, because I've I
am terrible at making slides and I have
lost so much of my career to just trying
to make slides look presentable and I
hate it and I I hate that it's an
expectation that they have to look good.
I understand why, but like it's just
it's been brutal for me. And Gamma for
me, Gamma.app
is like you can literally just dump in
text and it gives you slides. And the
slides are great. And I'm sure the font
should be a little different, but it is
it is ready to rock. I can walk into a
room within minutes of dropping it in
there. So that's how you know I don't
know we'll be using slides for the
offsite. I'll probably send out like a
Google doc. But if I were if I thought
we needed slides, I would say here are
the slides for the present for the for
the meeting. So this is like a 30 or 45
minute work session. I'm going to walk
in with a bunch of threads and I'm going
to walk out of this one-on-one with
executive team. Here's what you need for
the offsite in two weeks. Done. And
here's the slides we needed for the
meeting. Can someone add this piece of
data that's not in there? It's all
&gt;&gt; it's all ready to go. And again, again,
like a year ago, this would be, okay,
can someone help me with these freaking
slides? I know it's Friday at 2, but I
need slides for my peers now. Can you
please
&gt;&gt; spend two hours of your time making them
look good because it'll only take you
two hours. It'll take me eight,
&gt;&gt; you know, and then I got to wait. It's
Friday to get it back to me. So, I'll
just send it Monday. Like that that that
is where like the velocity really really
drops. Um because so much of work is
like okay let's end the meeting and then
everyone just needs a week you know
whatever the action item was you just
get a week
&gt;&gt; and half of this stuff you could
actually probably finish it in the
meeting with with you need in the
meeting it's like just don't go anywhere
for 10 minutes just do this do this
right now
&gt;&gt; the expectations because I love gamma
too and I'm kind of probably like early
like I haven't spent enough time but
once you spend so much time in there and
learning it it just becomes like
like it's it's like a it's like making
music it just works you know but you
have to become capable around doing that
you can't just expect to download gamma
and like where's my presentation
&gt;&gt; that's right
&gt;&gt; and I talked style you know recently
metav view and a lot of this stuff is
around human nature um
&gt;&gt; um like most things expectations etc so
I guess my question on that Brian maybe
both of you right now this all seems
optional like generally right like
You're an early adopter. You're choosing
to do this. Like most people probably
aren't
&gt;&gt; doing this at the level you're doing it.
It it it is objectively optional right
now. What happens two years from now
&gt;&gt; if you're not doing this? Is it still
optional? Like you know what I mean?
&gt;&gt; Again, I think I mentioned this the
first time I came on this. I was a dotr,
you know, I I recruited before the
internet, you know, and so there were
people who didn't who were recruiters in
the late 90s that were like, I don't
I've never had to use the internet now.
I've been doing this 20 years. Like why
why would I need to start? And so like
that's true. They kept their business
for a few years, late late 90s, early
 
Can you imagine a recruiting firm today
that doesn't use the internet
or by extension like where people don't
know how to use the internet? It's just
completely cannot exist 20 20 years
later, right? 25 years later. So I just
think it's similar. It's like in and you
you draw that extension like I remember
in the early part of my career people
who couldn't type. Can you imagine not
being able to type today? Like how would
you do your job if you couldn't really
type? Like you were a slow typer. those
you you just wouldn't get into the
working the professional working world
today if you can't use a keyboard like
super efficiently. Now I think that
might go away. I think like talk to text
is coming and stuff like that. But but
it's the same. I think it's it's it's
like relative comparison because it's
not knowing how to use any of these
tools in any way five years from now is
going to be such a limitation because it
will become so embedded in so many ways
things get done. It's the It's the
tension that all knowledge workers have,
which is I have a task that I need to
get done right now, but I also have this
brand new technology that I need to
learn. And what people are doing is
they're just going right to like, well,
I have this task. I know how to do it.
I'm going to do it the old way because
like I'm comfortable. That's really like
what's going on here is like people are
comfortable with their existing
workflows.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And this is this is where I've
been trying to like ring this bell like
really loud. Like this is like this is
like the dinosaurs like watching the
asteroid coming and them being like
cognizant of that thing and not trying
to like build some sort of defense
system as it's coming towards them.
That's what's happening right now. And
so I keep saying like I think there's a
mass extinction event happening. Um
because it's it's people who don't take
the time to learn and follow their
curiosity. You have to be curious about
this there. It's not it's it's I
disagree that it's optional. I I I think
it feels optional right now,
&gt;&gt; but it's obviously not.
&gt;&gt; Like clearly it is it is not optional.
It's coming. It's coming in the biggest
way possible. And like you know, Brian
just said he doesn't have an L &amp; D team.
Like he also just mentioned comp. Those
are the two things I've been thinking
about over the last 10 days, Brian. Like
those specific examples of it within the
people ops department, I think are at
the highest risk of AI coming for and
it's not like taking jobs, but it's like
not having as many humans,
&gt;&gt; right? It's just it's just not having as
many. I don't need as many if I'm using
the tools appropriately. Well, I think
again and this is a really important
distinction for us next door. I think a
person who's learning in public is the
CEO of Box. A Eron Levy is really really
good to follow
&gt;&gt; and he his thing is like which I agree
with the magic isn't just automating the
workflow with AI. It's doing it's
creating workflows that couldn't have
existed before. So, when it comes to
comp, like I think everybody wishes a
comp person could sit with every single
manager for every single comp discussion
decision that they have. We all wish we
could do that. You can't, you know, if
you're in a comp cycle, you've got like
two weeks to have 200 conversations, you
know, or 500 conver like you you can't
do it. you can actually do this now
where you could create like an AI comp
partner and every single person could
have their own custom comp person in
every single conversation. So that's
contemplating like that's not
conceivable to do with a the
bottlenecking of there's only so many
comp people, you know, the same thing um
the same thing as with onboarding,
right? Like we have to package
onboarding as a program that all the new
hires go through it together as one
thing because like there's only one
onboarding team and so you have to
generalize the content where you can now
like we're starting to experiment like
how can you create each person's
custom-designed onboarding buddy that
gives them their job specific
information over their first 90 days.
Like you can't do that with people. You
would not hire someone to just do that
job at that level of bespokeness. But
now the onboarding team can think that
way, you know. So I think that's where
that's why to's point it's important to
be learning because it starts to create
those types of experiences for people
teams that you just couldn't you're like
we don't have the headcount just can't
even think about it and there should be
urgency there. There should be real
urgency around this like you know and
this is the stuff to where it's like I
everyone has uh competing priorities
like I got two kids you know like I got
two kids they're like right in prime
time like you know six and five like I
want to be there I want to be around but
like if I don't carve out a couple hours
per week and really spend time like
learning this and like trying to apply
it to my workflows then I know what's
coming for me which is my extinction
moment and that's what I'm trying to
avoid.
Yeah. And I just I think it's also good
to to understand that not everyone ticks
that way. It's hard, you guys. Like I
&gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] found myself yesterday creating
slides and I was like, "Stop.
&gt;&gt; Go to Gamma.
&gt;&gt; Take an extra [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 24 minutes."
&gt;&gt; Um, give it a whirl with, you know,
giving myself permission to get out of
it, right? That's that's the biggest
thing for at least me and the others is
you have to do it. You have to feel like
just go tinker. Give yourself permission
to not do it if you're
&gt;&gt; and as a people officer giving
permission like one of the best points
of feedback we I got internally was
people really appreciated these group
work sessions where they could just kind
of tinker in a dedicated tinker time.
They were allowed to be there. were
supposed to be there and like I wanted
to move on to the next lesson or
whatever. Like no, I just got to let
people kind of like get lost in it for
&gt;&gt; soable
thing for people. Yeah. You know,
&gt;&gt; creating the space for low stakes like
you don't have to get anything out of it
necessarily and that it becomes but
&gt;&gt; it's like a hackathon.
&gt;&gt; It's kind of great. We did a hackathon.
Like those things are really really
crucial because they to your point Kelly
like not everybody can find the night
and weekend time so to speak or that's
just they can but that's not how they
learn. They're not going to get it done
on their own. So all these different
ways people go down that path.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I hope that more of us have
more conversations like this because
right now it does seem a little you know
what I mean? Like I hope we can all come
together and like Brian you could
probably open a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] consulting firm
on this stuff, right? you know, just
grab someone and be like, "Hey, do you
got 10? Like, you got 10 minutes? Share
your screen." Like, "Show me how you set
up this custom comp."
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; That's the kind of stuff that's going to
get people comfortable because right now
it's a lot of impostor or fear. Like,
you just got to kind of take the leap,
you know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There's so much vaporware. There
is. I'm really sensitive to what you're
saying, Kelly. There's so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
out there right now, you know? And
&gt;&gt; there's so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm about
to pay you on the side and like do one
hour a week and like show me how to
build these. I'm serious. Like um it's
it is it's important. So
&gt;&gt; it's what the thing so you know I've
been working a while and that this has
disrupted my since I became like an
executive seuite. This has disrupted how
I spend my time on a weekly basis more
dramatically than like I guess work from
home. I guess going to work from home
was like a major disruption too. So, but
like my my time like many execs, my time
would be like 13 to 15 meetings a day
just freaking maxed all all day and that
that's how I got maximum leverage. But
now these spaces where I'm using this
tool is creating equal leverage. You
know, I have to kill meetings so I can
get this time now, which I wouldn't have
felt like that a year ago. It would have
been like, oh, I got to figure this out.
But now I know I need it to get the
stuff done I need to get done. Um, it's
it's kind of found its way. I really
shap and I think we're
&gt;&gt; totally I mean I think we're probably
close to wrapping up but my if I have
one takeaway out out of this and I
actually it was a takeaway I didn't I
don't spend my time like this right now
I'm about to change it is
wrap this into how you operate like wrap
something in to your operating
mechanisms for the week whether it's by
yourself
&gt;&gt; with one person on your team you want to
get like really smart really quick and
then teach the
with a team meeting like just wrap it
like create space for it in how you run
the business. I'm going to start
changing that. So
&gt;&gt; yeah, the the last thing I'll leave
people with is um I've been reading Cal
Newport's new book, Slow Productivity.
And like the I think a lot of the
lessons there are really applicable to
right now, which is like you have to do
fewer things like you you cannot like
this is not about taking on more. I
think that's actually like a misnomer
about this era, right? It's like we can
do more. I actually think you need to do
less and you need to be so obsessed with
the quality that of your output and
making AI part of the workflow for the
fewer things that you're doing with
super high quality and then I think
people will feel a lot better as opposed
to just like oh well this just means I
can take on more. I don't agree with
that. I don't think that's true today.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um thank you both.
&gt;&gt; Are we doing the lingo? Yeah, you're
doing your lingo thing.
&gt;&gt; This is a pretty heavy conversation. So,
you know,
&gt;&gt; you set it up, though. You got to do it.
You got to lead us into this, Kelly.
&gt;&gt; No, I know this was a heavy chat. So, we
got to leave with some levity, you know,
with some fun. So, we're going to we're
going to do a rapid fire round and it's
going to be around just the corporate
speak. Like, what is your most the the
shittiest corporate lingo that maybe you
hear, you've heard, maybe you use. We're
all guilty. And not only do I want you
to say the phrase, I want you to use it
in a sentence. I want the audience to
like feel how this this this this
happens out in the jungle with this
corporate lingo. And while you're
thinking about that, Brian, you
mentioned HR Heretic swag. That would be
I mean, Nolan, I think, printed a couple
t-shirts once, but
&gt;&gt; I don't think you need me. You got a
nice fuzzy bear on your sweatshirt. It
looks like Paddington right now.
&gt;&gt; You need bumper stickers from people who
are riding into work.
Okay. So, I'll go first since I sprung
this on these these these dudes right
before we started. But the phrase that I
I just can't stand and I've used it
before myself is circling the wagons.
And how I've always heard this is, yeah,
you know what? You know what, Jane,
that's a great idea. Let's let's
regroup. Let me let me circle the wagons
internally and we'll we'll we'll we'll
we'll circle back next week.
circle the wagons internally. That's
&gt;&gt; why do you hate it?
&gt;&gt; It's just it it it presents to me first
of all politics which I hate just this
unnecessary
running around kind of um hurting cats
together circling wagons bureaucracy
getting stuff through just like it
screams [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to me. And so I
whenever I hear it now I'm like what
does that mean? Who are you going to?
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking it's like Louiswis and
Clark era history. Like you're you're
supposed to put the wagons in a circle.
&gt;&gt; What wagons are you circling and who
circle? What does that mean? So that's
tough.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like I'm all about analogies, but
that one like actually doesn't make
sense at all.
&gt;&gt; It's pretty old.
&gt;&gt; Circle the wagons. Okay, let's move on.
&gt;&gt; Brian,
&gt;&gt; um
um my my my current trigger phrase is uh
take it offline.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And this would mean like, you
know, Kelly and I are wasting everyone's
time talking too long or more likely one
of us doesn't know the answer in front
of everybody and so we're we're folding
and we're saying, "Hey, let's just take
it offline. Let's let's get out of the
view of the people in the meeting and
get our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together and come back."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I found I hate like it it's even
worse, you know? So, take it offline,
which I mean we're online right now.
Take it offline means I guess go talk
about it somewhere else. But
&gt;&gt; and everyone Almost every I heard almost
every meeting like let's take this
offline right now and
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And every everyone's like what are
they going to do offline? What does that
mean? What happened?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like what's going I'm always
curious like what's going on there? Like
I kind of want to know, you know, what
what are you guys going to go do?
&gt;&gt; Uh love it.
&gt;&gt; I'm over it.
mine. This is like a serious tr It's
It's funny you mentioned this today,
Kelly, because I knew mine right away
when you said it and I hadn't actually
um I haven't thought about it like when
people say I just get super annoyed and
then think they're dumber when they say
it. Uh which is I want to double click
into this.
&gt;&gt; It's It's literally from 2015. Like if
you said it from 2015 to 2017 like you
were part of the VC lingo at the time
like salute to you. It is 2025 now. If
you are still saying that you are using
empty words and every time you say it I
am boiling inside and wondering when I
can get off this phone call because I
think you're dumb. That's
&gt;&gt; Oh my god. I think I might have said
that like last month to
not even joking dude.
&gt;&gt; I'm with you on that's uh that's got to
go.
&gt;&gt; Oh my god. Okay, so thank you for
humoring me. I love this kind of stuff.
Uh, everyone, if if you thought this was
entertaining, like, please tell us and
throw in your favorite corporate phrase
because it's just it's fun to make fun
of ourselves sometimes, isn't it?
Especially you, Nolan.
&gt;&gt; And Kell, while we're on it, Brian,
we're going to now require you to be a
regular guest um because of your passive
aggre passive aggressive comments of
yelling at us in the car. So, we will
now bring you on regularly so you can
actually just kind of meet the beast in
the arena
&gt;&gt; and whenever we say whenever we say dumb
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we would love to get your opinion
on it. Please.
&gt;&gt; The more the more abuse, the better. So,
if if you want to be on, just abuse us
and we'll, you know, hang out.
&gt;&gt; You guys are great. Please keep doing
what you're doing.
&gt;&gt; All right. Later. Thanks everyone.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.
