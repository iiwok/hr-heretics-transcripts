For today's essential heretics 101
feature, we explore compensation
testing, remote culture scaling,
leadership transparency, and AI adoption
challenges through the analytical lens
of Christine Senta, Hashi Corp's chief
people officer. All right, everybody.
Welcome back to another session of HR
Heretics. It's great to have you. We're
so happy to be here with Christine Senta
who's the chief people officer at Hashi
Corp. I'm a big fan of Hashi Corp. Have
been for a while. Can't wait to get into
this. Prior to Hashi Corp for the past
about five years, she was at Pivotal
Software and senior leadership roles.
And then before that almost had a
 
up by Dell. Is that right, Christine?
Yeah. So, thank you so much for joining
us. I know you're super slammed cuz you
and Dave are building like crazy over at
Hashi Corp. Before we started recording,
Christine tried to apologize to us
because sometimes she apparently swears,
which if you're an avid listener, you're
laughing right now because it's kind of
like our second language. So, let's get
into it. Nolan, where we want to start?
&gt;&gt; I'd actually love to start with you.
You're in the seat now after a career
that was almost exclusively in
compensation and I think you've been in
the seat now for about seven eight
months. How's that transition been for
you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually it's been relatively
natural to be honest. I I was able to
start my career in a rotational program.
So, I did a lot of different roles
within HR and I did find my niche in
comp back in the later EMC days and
truly loved the analytical components
and being able to drive business
decisions based on data and and and I
definitely like the the compensation
element of the the rewards, but the the
the job I had back at Pivotal Software
and the Hashi Corp job was definitely
broader than just comp, right? So over
time I I really was able to kind of
build all the other components, right?
So it's broader into total rewards. It
got into people operations. It got into
mobility. Quite frankly, they made me do
the HR for HR job. We all love that one.
So I never really got rid of the
business partner part. So it was it was
an okay it it was a pretty it was a
pretty seamless transition.
&gt;&gt; We've been talking a lot about comp on
the show and I think there's a lot going
on. There's a lot of data right now from
Carta that shows that the comp has
actually like remained very flat over
the last couple of years in as it
relates to a cash standpoint. In equity,
we've actually seen for ventureback tech
companies it go down significantly,
especially for new hire grants. What are
you guys seeing in in compensation right
now? And how are you guys thinking about
it given the macroeconomic environment?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that seeing pretty pretty
similar similar things. I think from a
comp perspective, you know, things have
stayed pretty relatively flat. I mean,
granted, we were still kind of in our,
you know, in our growth phase for for a
while. So, you're always kind of trying
to play catch-up in that in that
element. So, we we were able to continue
to bump folks up and not have to do
anything like where nothing, you know,
flat or no no increases or anything like
that. So, that was good, you know, dip
in kind of what the equity offerings
were were going to be. And and it was
interesting because we were coming out
of that that period where and I have
done a lot of the equity modeling over
the years in a variety of different jobs
and I'm like I'm not trusting that data.
I think there's a lag market data lag
because it was it was rough. It was a
rough for a lot of companies with their
equity burn really rough for a couple
years. I you brought up a a good point
around around the equity and and the the
lag that that's the point that you
brought up that that so many of us have
lived because we live and die by market
data and comp data and this how how have
you done that have you been like a loud
voice so you try to like tap your
colleagues at other companies we have
these conversations all the time just
like you know we're having these convers
I love like this forums this is the
stuff that we we need to be doing as HR
professionals talking about this stuff
all the time. I love this podcast. I was
definitely talking to like our our comp
consultants for sure. The other thing
that we did which I thought was good was
we had our ranges and then we started to
do it almost like in a a trial function
when I was like you know what here's our
range but you can't go over midpoint
anymore.
Let's spend the next two months midpoint
midpoint and below. Tell me how it goes.
&gt;&gt; I love it.
&gt;&gt; We tested it for a couple months mid
midpoint to low. We were we were fine.
And so I kind of laid out this process
so that we could test it for a period.
Um we just tested it and see how it went
and it worked. Um
&gt;&gt; the recruiters are such an important
point and one of my companies I mean
Nolan do you have opinion on this? Yeah,
it's recruiting tends to have a really
good pulse on what's going on in the
market. But Christine, to your point, we
also tend to just be like, well, like,
you know, we can just solve all the
problems with comps
&gt;&gt; just from a negotiation perspective,
they will leverage like any they will
leverage what they have. So, if you can
close this candidate faster if you just
stay at midpoint, stay at midpoint. If
you have to go above it, make a
compelling case and tell me why. So, it
also made it hard. I just made it a
little harder. Just made it a little bit
harder.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A little extra red tape changes
everything.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I want to get your take on some
of these these new grants that we're
seeing. What is your take on, you know,
how how companies are are now moving
away from the standard four-year vest
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think like a lot of the HR
practices or policies, you know, we're
really starting to get to that phase
where it's really trying to figure out
what is going to work given the current
state phase that your company is in, how
mature it is, how big it is, how many
countries, public, private. It has to be
a really purposeful
long-term
decision play to make sure you really
are thinking through what does this mean
for me next year and not just solving
for for today. and and if and if it's
something you can solve for in the long
term or you're prepared for that, fine.
But if you haven't thought about it,
it's just going to create another issue
for you in the following year.
&gt;&gt; You guys went public in 2021 and you had
joined, I think, in 2020. What has been
like the biggest change between the
private version of Hashi and the public
version of Hashi?
&gt;&gt; I I think the biggest shift was post
that period was really getting the
operational rigor in place related to a
lot of processes. we were still kind of
going through that post going public and
it's because we had grown at such a
scale and we were still we were still
growing right it was just get them in
the door get them in the door get them
in the door so I think we were there was
more of a catch-up mode from like a
process perspective and that was
probably the the biggest difference I
saw
&gt;&gt; yeah were you able to maintain the the
shape of your talent and the right
talent
&gt;&gt; we absolutely saw that post going public
you definitely have that contingent
that's like nope nope I'm the startup
team you know that kind of stuff so Dave
likes to talk about it as as our O he
talks about it in the phase shifts that
definitely was a shift related to
where we were and the growth that we
were doing right and you can definitely
see the difference in like whether
that's your sales team or whatever and
that level of what you want to do from a
company phase perspective. Hey everyone,

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads Talented Signal Fire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metave is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver. Because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metaview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metaview. Head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metave's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
You had mentioned being fully remote.
How do you guys think about this remote
versus in office debate that we're
unbelievably having again?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's we have a very unique history
on this. Initially, the company was
built as a remote remote based, right?
So, it was very much built in a culture
of it was okay to work from home and
people were remote and so very writing
based culture, very Slack happy culture,
very Zoom happy culture. when COVID hit,
right, and
companies were trying to figure out how
do we go remote? Like, what do we do? We
were all kind of like, well, just do
this like this isn't hard. This isn't
hard. This is how we do it. This works.
Then when you start to hit that critical
mass, right, and you're in, you know, 20
countries around the world and all this
kind of stuff, like it becomes
more, you really have to be super
deliberate and intentional to maintain a
remote work environment. We need to
build community. We need to make sure
there are intentional connection points
for people. There is clearly a gap in
how folks are feeling connected and we
we have to crack this like folks need to
feel engaged. They need and they need to
feel like a sense of belonging and
connected. So that has been a a bit of a
a stark realization.
&gt;&gt; How is that showing up? Like how is the
the lack of connectedness showing up?
&gt;&gt; You'll see a a decision point, you know,
that's made that's brought to the
executive team or whatever. then you
discover like a really critical team
that's part of implementing that and
making that happen. Like there's a a
misalignment in kind of some of those
decisions being made and it's just
because there hasn't been that
opportunity to talk about it or
collaborate. If there was better
crossunctional collaboration across some
teams, those things would have come up.
If you're, you know, really truly
remote, you have to force that. You have
to be really intentional like, oh, I
joined the company. This is my job. I'm
VP of whatever. To be successful in my
job, I need to know who these people
are. And I've got to go out and find
them. I got to find them online. I got
to find them in workday. I got to type
them in. I got to find them on Slack.
Make sure that I meet them because I'm
not going to see them at a meeting or a
lead. I'm not going to, right? You have
to like really be super intentional.
&gt;&gt; Any sticking points between you and
Dave? Anything that's particularly
spicy as far as philosophy or approach
or
Yeah, I think so Dave is um so so much
respect for him. Learned so so much from
this man. He is kind of known internally
here as like a combination of like the
professor and an accountant. He thinks a
lot in you know frameworks and systems
and results and inputs and outputs and
that kind of thing. So, we're talking
about, you know, building community and
connection and relationship and wanting
to, you know, come up with cost as like
relatable and personable, like that kind
of stuff. I've been like, I'm like, you
know, something as simple as X would go
a long way. You know, I know you don't
want to consider another holiday, but
this one we really need to add. I
promise adding this holiday is not going
to make a difference in your
productivity numbers. So, I think it's
been kind of some of that stuff. When I
started here, I pushed for like, you
know what, I'm doing a wage gap study
and when I get the results, I'm telling
people it was not perfect. It was not.
And we talked about it and I said, it's
not perfect. And so, and we just
released our our last one, and we're
we're we're there. We're so close. So,
great. So, we talked about it, but that
was definitely one of those like, what
are we going to do?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's always amazed me how how
empathetic employees can actually be
towards us
&gt;&gt; if you communicate. I think that's like
what both of you are getting at which is
and Christine, you had said it before,
which is when you don't communicate,
people fill in gaps with the worst
version of the story.
&gt;&gt; That's right. And there's been times
where it's like we don't know the
answer. I'm still getting out in front
and saying, I know this is a hot topic.
I don't know. And I still don't know. So
true. All right, I want let's talk about
AI. So AI is like coming. How are you
guys thinking about the AI strategy for
the people team?
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, I'm This is kind of one of
those areas where I've been thinking
about it and talking about it for a few
years and we're just so behind where I
would want to be to be, you know, fully
transparent because I'm super excited
about this and we just have been doing
so much catchup for other operational
things that we just haven't been able to
lean in on it as some of the other other
big companies have. So, for example, it
would be great if we could get to a
point where we could leverage AI for
employee inquiries. Then you start to
like peel back the onion and you're
like, okay, so in order to do that, in
order for that to even make sense, that
means all of our information for what
employees common questions are need to
be really easily searchable in one way,
in one form, in one thing. The amount of
work to prepare for the AI was just
exorbitant. And then that became, you
know, really difficult for like the day
the day-to-day. I do think like that is
a huge area where that would would be
exciting if you if you actually have the
time like from the ground up to really
think about here's all my people team
content. How do I put it in a way that I
really could leverage a tool or a
system?
&gt;&gt; I'm I'm actually like really interested
in this because I agree with you. I'm
seeing it a lot in recruiting.
Recruiting feels like the frontier for
most people teams, but how are you guys
deploying it? What are the problems
you're solving? Yeah, that we're still
early early onset just coming just
coming. But it it really is a matter of
like how do you source through how do
you source through candidates, right?
How do you source through and do you
know top level searches for oneliners or
skills and such and then how do you
assess like certain elements of how
folks code? How do you assess like
certain elements of that as part of the
initial front? So I think there could be
a future
and it's likely where we're going to be
honest or that can there might be that
initial phase of funnel that might be
purely AI based right but it can't be a
you know and I think that that would
work but you can't you can't set it and
forget it right it has to be like a
methodology of what are you doing and
how are you sourcing and making sure
that there's an audit capability to make
sure that I feel like you would have to
in some sort I just wouldn't want to set
it and just say good to go. I do think
though that there might be a future
where it works when
candidates are at that point where they
know that's exactly how it's going to
read and they've all adapted their
resume to the way it would need to go.
&gt;&gt; What an interesting take. Totally.
&gt;&gt; I mean they're going to do it too. I
mean they're already using it to create
their resume. So what what's the diff,
you know, what's important to this
company? Let me look up their
principles. Let me look up their
strategy. Let me look up the stuff
that's important. AI, please create a
resume that has these words.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're totally right though about
the candidate like that. I had not
thought about it that way, but you're
 
candidates expecting it to be part of
the experience, especially at the top of
the funnel because that's like the most
reasonable place to deploy it just to to
um make you feel potentially a little
bit better about the stuff that you can
miss with AI.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. I agree.
&gt;&gt; That's super interesting.
&gt;&gt; And I think for me, one of my big
takeaways, Christine, you said is that I
don't think a lot of teams have crossed
this bridge yet because we're all
talking about, wouldn't it be great if
and when we can do this and this with
AI, the work to get there,
that's a whole another [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
ball game. I think that was the first
first fbomb any of us had said, by the
way, on this episode. But
&gt;&gt; yeah, Kelly got Kelly got real. It's But
it, you know, it's it is one of those
situations though to where like I I
think right now, Christine, you're in
the same situation as everyone else,
which is like nobody's really deployed
it in a meaningful way, but we we are
now starting to like tangibly feel and
believe in like the next frontier of it.
And this is like a perfect example. I
think the knowledge base is like another
one of those perfect examples. like we
can all see and feel that your your
point around the knowledge base was
interesting though because I I think you
know we get caught up in like oh my god
what is the end state and how are people
going to use this when we forget about
like how much work is it going to take
to deploy this thing and is that is that
cost benefit worth it and I think right
now you're you're actually figuring out
exactly what my friends are figuring out
like h we'll just kind of wait until
this next version of it gets better and
it's easier for us to deploy
&gt;&gt; and I don't think that a lot of folks
are aware of the work to make this
perfect utopia like easy. It's a whole
&gt;&gt; So I find it interesting too like when
I'm talking to some of like folks on my
team or like we're having like career
conversations of like what do I want to
do next? What do I and like for
particularly folks like in the people
operations arena like what do you want
to do? I'm like you know what I want to
make sure you're not afraid of this.
Lean in. Learn it's coming. And I think
this is going to be like a huge niche
for people from a skills perspective on
how do you leverage AI and leverage it
well. And like there's so many I mean
like this is I think this could be a
really cool
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Some companies are already
anointing roles or andor people to focus
on figuring this out which makes total
sense.
&gt;&gt; It does. Absolutely. Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Christine, this has been a blast. We're
so grateful for you taking the time. You
guys are absolutely killing it right now
at Hashi and we wish you nothing but
success moving in the future.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. This was super fun
and just an honor to be able to to chat
with you. So, thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Christine.
&gt;&gt; You're one of the heretics now.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
