yeah awesome well excited to be back on
 
yeah awesome well excited to be back on
here with you uh Nolan and Kelly so I
 
here with you uh Nolan and Kelly so I
think there's a few perspectives uh to
 
think there's a few perspectives uh to
look at this I think one just purely
 
look at this I think one just purely
from a practical perspective of is this
 
from a practical perspective of is this
going to be net good for the company and
 
going to be net good for the company and
it's often you know that's correlated
 
it's often you know that's correlated
with is this the right decision is this
 
with is this the right decision is this
morally correct I think all those things
 
morally correct I think all those things
are correlated but I do think and it's
 
are correlated but I do think and it's
going to be impossible to prove this
 
going to be impossible to prove this
this will probably actually be n good
 
this will probably actually be n good
for the company just judging based off
 
for the company just judging based off
of um how the last few years at the last
 
of um how the last few years at the last
couple years in particular gone how Tech
 
couple years in particular gone how Tech
has sort of been uh reacting I think and
 
has sort of been uh reacting I think and
to um some of the uh big shifts in
 
to um some of the uh big shifts in
diversity and some of the perspectives
 
diversity and some of the perspectives
that have been uh big focuses for the
 
that have been uh big focuses for the
for companies the last few years I think
 
for companies the last few years I think
there's sort of been a counter reaction
 
there's sort of been a counter reaction
to that my initial sense is that just
 
to that my initial sense is that just
you know judging from the LinkedIn
 
you know judging from the LinkedIn
comments um and and the comments from
 
comments um and and the comments from
folks that I've talked to who have who
 
folks that I've talked to who have who
have spoke about this is that this is
 
have spoke about this is that this is
going to be more of an attracting for
 
going to be more of an attracting for
for it's not going to actively reject or
 
for it's not going to actively reject or
repel uh most people uh I believe um but
 
repel uh most people uh I believe um but
I guess that'll mean to be seen um I do
 
I guess that'll mean to be seen um I do
think there are some ways in which this
 
think there are some ways in which this
was executed that I'm not the biggest
 
was executed that I'm not the biggest
fan of but generally I do think this is
 
fan of but generally I do think this is
probably actually be good for scale and
 
probably actually be good for scale and
whether it is good for scale just from a
 
whether it is good for scale just from a
retention and hiring perspective will be
 
retention and hiring perspective will be
a big signaling for uh many of the
 
a big signaling for uh many of the
companies as they adjust their hiring
 
companies as they adjust their hiring
practices what do you not like about
 
practices what do you not like about
it so I think thing I don't like is how
 
it so I think thing I don't like is how
it was positioned as Mei is counter Dei
 
it was positioned as Mei is counter Dei
and I think he explicitly said as as you
 
and I think he explicitly said as as you
just quoted that mayor is not counter
 
just quoted that mayor is not counter
diversity at the same time it was very
 
diversity at the same time it was very
explicitly chosen the acronym Mei is is
 
explicitly chosen the acronym Mei is is
signaling that it sort of implies that
 
signaling that it sort of implies that
the m is in contrast to a d and on the
 
the m is in contrast to a d and on the
flip side I do understand why he chose
 
flip side I do understand why he chose
that because unfortunately in some in in
 
that because unfortunately in some in in
many cases aics of diversity have uh
 
many cases aics of diversity have uh
been opposed to Merit as a term and I
 
been opposed to Merit as a term and I
think we each have anecdotes but I think
 
think we each have anecdotes but I think
the vast majority of people including
 
the vast majority of people including
myself who are quote unquote pro-
 
myself who are quote unquote pro-
diversity as if you can simply
 
diversity as if you can simply
categorize people as Pro or
 
categorize people as Pro or
anti-diversity um would argue that that
 
anti-diversity um would argue that that
is not counter to Merit but it can be
 
is not counter to Merit but it can be

perfect all the time I I had this quote
on on LinkedIn um
 
on on LinkedIn um
about uh from Winston Churchill and he
 
about uh from Winston Churchill and he
said it's it's been said that democracy
 
said it's it's been said that democracy
is the worst form of government except
 
is the worst form of government except
all the others that have been tried and
 
all the others that have been tried and
I I think that that's very true here
 
I I think that that's very true here
like I think Merit is probably the worst
 
like I think Merit is probably the worst
form but like nothing else is better
 
form but like nothing else is better
than it and so we have to just accept
 
than it and so we have to just accept
that it's not going to be perfect so
 
that it's not going to be perfect so
that's my first
 
that's my first
take in addition um you know when I
 
take in addition um you know when I
