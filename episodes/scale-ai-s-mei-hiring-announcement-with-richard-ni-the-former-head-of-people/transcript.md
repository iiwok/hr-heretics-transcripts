# Scale AI's "MEI" Hiring Announcement with Richard Ni, the former Head of People

## Transcript

 
hey everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we're doing a special
episode on the recent news from scale
[Applause]

[Music]
AI so let me set the scene and I'll
introduce our special guest so scale AI
just raised a billion dollar at a$1 13
billion valuation 13 some change um they
are one of the biggest players obviously
in the AI space now their CEO had a post
last week um and and he's coming up with
a new term called
Mei which stands for merit excellence
and intelligence I'll I'll read a couple
of passages from this and then I'll turn
it over to Richard and and Kelly so a
couple of things that Alex who's the CEO
said he said number one scale is scale
is a meritocracy and we must always
remain One hiring on Merit will be a
permanent policy at scale I think of our
guiding principle as Mei Merit
excellence and intelligence that means
we hire only the best person for the job
we seek out and demand excellence and we
unapologetically prefer people who are
very smart we CH everyone as an
individual we do not unfairly stereotype
tokenize or otherwise treat anyone as a
member of a demographic group rather
than as an individual we believe that
people should be judged by the content
of their character and as colleagues be
additionally judged by their talent
skills and work ethic there is a
mistaken belief that meritocracy somehow
conflicts with diversity I strongly
disagree no group has a monopoly on
Excellence so today we have a special
guest which is Richard KN Richard KN was
the head of people at scale from the
very earliest days all the way tell
about last year so Richard thanks so
much for joining us I want to kick it
over to you to get your take on Alex's
post and how you're thinking about it
yeah awesome well excited to be back on
here with you uh Nolan and Kelly so I
think there's a few perspectives uh to
look at this I think one just purely
from a practical perspective of is this
going to be net good for the company and
it's often you know that's correlated
with is this the right decision is this
morally correct I think all those things
are correlated but I do think and it's
going to be impossible to prove this
this will probably actually be n good
for the company just judging based off
of um how the last few years at the last
couple years in particular gone how Tech
has sort of been uh reacting I think and
to um some of the uh big shifts in
diversity and some of the perspectives
that have been uh big focuses for the
for companies the last few years I think
there's sort of been a counter reaction
to that my initial sense is that just
you know judging from the LinkedIn
comments um and and the comments from
folks that I've talked to who have who
have spoke about this is that this is
going to be more of an attracting for
for it's not going to actively reject or
repel uh most people uh I believe um but
I guess that'll mean to be seen um I do
think there are some ways in which this
was executed that I'm not the biggest
fan of but generally I do think this is
probably actually be good for scale and
whether it is good for scale just from a
retention and hiring perspective will be
a big signaling for uh many of the
companies as they adjust their hiring
practices what do you not like about
it so I think thing I don't like is how
it was positioned as Mei is counter Dei
and I think he explicitly said as as you
just quoted that mayor is not counter
diversity at the same time it was very
explicitly chosen the acronym Mei is is
signaling that it sort of implies that
the m is in contrast to a d and on the
flip side I do understand why he chose
that because unfortunately in some in in
many cases aics of diversity have uh
been opposed to Merit as a term and I
think we each have anecdotes but I think
the vast majority of people including
myself who are quote unquote pro-
diversity as if you can simply
categorize people as Pro or
anti-diversity um would argue that that
is not counter to Merit but it can be
perceived that way got it Kelly what's
your
take this is this is a big one uh I
remember gez it was 10 years ago now
that I started a GitHub this story and
if you all remember GitHub in addition
to the huge you know bar and $10 million
office they they created the Oval Office
and there was a huge carpet right a rug
in the middle of it and it said right
meritocracy on the Seal of this carpet
and I remember one day it was gone it
was removed and I bring that up because
this is not the first time this this has
happened right that meritocracy Dei have
conflicted and we've talked a lot about
patterns on this show and things you
know come come around full circle and I
think we're here again
um and obviously scale is talking about
you know Mei very very very clearly I
just I I just get fired I get a bit
annoyed at this to be honest
like you know Silicon Valley
theoretically has some of the smartest
people in the world and we can't
freaking realize that both things like
are true I or we want to be true I just
I don't understand that I don't
understand how a reasonable person can't
say we want the best people for the job
and sometimes there are great people
that could be great and the best person
for a job but they haven't had the same
luck
background privilege Equitable
situations to get there and we have to
work a little harder to bring those
people in and then assess them against a
whole group of people that could be the
best for the job so I just I I think
that once again media and we see it all
the freaking time we have the election
coming up people just get real swept up
real emotional which I understand why
really fired up and I myself am guilty
of this sometimes and we tend to throw
the baby out with the bath water and we
don't look at what is true or what is
not in all situations and I will end by
saying I will talk to anyone who
disagrees I think any smart reasonable
objective person can sit down and pick
the good things about Dei the good
things about Merit and put them together
why is this why is this an either or
you've accused me on former episodes
Nolan of talking about meritocracy you
said once what you're describing is a
meritocracy let's have that and make
sure we have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] diverse people and
then we're doing the right things for
people who are aren't as privileged as
people like us potentially on this call
so I I'm sorry I think I'm getting
Goosebumps now but I just I've seen it
for 25 years and we still haven't
figured it out because we're silly
humans that's what I think I love it all
right so let me what's really
interesting about this is when I first
saw it I I was like not interesting like
I I don't think it's interesting like I
think what Alex basically did was um a
little bit of like following coinbase's
footsteps which you know took place four
years ago and so when I first saw it I
saw it immediately on Twitter and my
take was like okay like not that
interesting like Mei Dei like that's
cute I see what you did there but like
this isn't news for me and then what
happened is I'd say maybe eight of my
friends who work in HR were like hey
have you seen this that you guys should
talk about it and that surprised me
because I was like wait hold on like
what's what's interesting about this
then I started to talk to people and
engage with people who were bothered by
it and so I I just want to steal man the
side of the folks that say they have a
problem with meritocracy and here's what
I'm hearing I think the first thing is
is that meritocracy is selectively
applied and so it's it's hey well we
have you know we say we're a meritocracy
but you know the the CEO's kid is now an
intern or like you know the investor who
led our last round you know got somebody
in the back door and we keep them around
even though they're a middling
performer and I I think that's the piece
that like really bothers people is that
meritocracy is
imperfect and it's talked about as if
it's this Panacea to solve all problems
with performance and low performers and
and things of that that
nature I think that's the the Steelman
case of the other side which I do
understand hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metav view is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
Kora and check out medavie head over to
metav view. a/ Heretics to talk to one
of metav VI's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled in
minutes Kelly this morning Colleen
texted us uh Colleen mccre friend of the
show and and Netflix just put out their
their new culture dock today I I haven't
had a chance to like do the double click
I I read it once I think it's really
good and I think one of the things that
they do really well is they talk about
it being
imperfect they talk about themselves not
living up to the standards all the time
and I think that's the piece that's like
that's that's missing for folks to make
it more of a
um like a like a togetherness like hey
like this is what we should strive for
even though we're not going to be
perfect all the time I I had this quote
on on LinkedIn um
about uh from Winston Churchill and he
said it's it's been said that democracy
is the worst form of government except
all the others that have been tried and
I I think that that's very true here
like I think Merit is probably the worst
form but like nothing else is better
than it and so we have to just accept
that it's not going to be perfect so
that's my first
take in addition um you know when I
think about these people who don't like
Merit I think what I the the thing I'm
most bothered by is I'm not hearing an
alternative
solution and I you know as I engage in
in people and I'm trying to learn I
think all of us on this show like Kelly
this is a reason why we're doing the
show right it's what we said at the very
beginning we want to
learn and I think people who come and
poke holes in a
system without proposing
Solutions or an alternative system
are not engaging in a real debate I
think they're just casting stones from
the
outside and uh you know it's really easy
to do that and it's and frankly it's
kind of like the fans in the cheap seats
at a baseball game like yelling in and
out like you're not involved in the game
but hey you get your two cents and like
good for you and I think that's my
problem with that side now if I take if
I look at Alex and I and I look at the
post and I see why some people are upset
about it I think um Richard you nailed
it to where you know Mei versus Dei and
I think what Alex is trying to do is to
rile people up and even though he
explicitly calls out with the one
sentence that like diversity should not
be opposed here I think he did that for
a very specific reason and I think part
of that is is to rile people up because
you have to do that in order to
achieve virality in social media that's
my Richard what do you think yeah no I
think that's absolutely true and uh I
think scale is a position right now
where they can afford to to be on the
news they you know just ra a big round
the business has gone really well I've
had other friends of mine who are
thinking about doing know similar things
so they make S announcement they launch
the type of thing and I think it's a lot
different if your company is is doing
well I think that's another interesting
thing for me is I don't think and I'm
not an Insider at scale anymore I do not
you know constantly keep tabs on people
anything but to my best knowledge this
wasn't in reaction to anything I think
he mentioned the coin basing room for
years ago but my understanding when I
looked into that situation is it wasn't
a reaction to slack message it was a
reaction to something being a big
distraction to the company and to the
best of my understanding this is not in
reaction to an event or a situation that
occurred at scale which means it was
more of a proactive hey we think this is
going to be really good from us for us
from a hiring perspective and a
retention perspective more than a we
need to play defense on some topic I
mean just a month ago I think scale
hosted a hackathon for um women
particular such women in Tech generative
AI hackathon Alex was there he was
making the rounds talking to folks he
didn't have to be there you know the
company can still host this type of
thing you could argue that's that's not
a diversity initiative but you could
argue it is because it was just for
women you know for example and so I
genuinely don't believe that Alex is
anti-diversity um and I genuinely
believe he does believe in the words
that he's saying in the post at the same
time probably the choice of Mei was
explicit and it was a calculation that
this would be net good for the company
if did go viral and it attracted more
people to want to join scale which is
hiring a lot of folks right now that
that is a a great example Richard
of it actually can be both and I think a
lot of folks are assuming it's it's all
this or all that and you know what both
of you please disagree with me this all
comes down to people hey everyone we'll
be right back in a moment after a word
from our
sponsors here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive

actually like using it which is why
companies like Ryan a Dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds

other features help help Elevate the

[Music]
you you pick it you know what I mean
like Colleen's medium post you read it
both of you probably but like she talks
about trust in the people running these
systems like it could be a government it
could be a company it could be a school
it can be a jail it can be anything you
name it but what this comes down to
meritocracy Dei all of it is people that
are making decisions and creating these
systems right it takes one decision for
the CEO to be like nope we're doing all
these things diversity Amit whatever you
call it and then a day later bringing in
their kid to be an intern and bring like
that's what this Bo do is corrupt is
corruption and I don't say that as like
a big scary word but corruption in the
system and I do believe the people that
are getting really upset about this they
were impacted in some negative way by
someone corrupting something that was
against the Cress of a system they
created and I empathize with that I get
that and you have others who never were
impacted by it and they're kind of like
H they don't really say anything or they
don't care you know but it all comes
down to the people that are running
these things and any organization across
the world and making these decisions and
the people that impacted by it either
negatively or positively that that's
what I think and that and there's
there's very few checks and balances in
totally yeah you know like it is uh
generally companies are run from an
authoritarian standpoint like there's
one leader and they get what they want
and typically the exec team like gets
what they want and so you could say
things I think everyone has experien
this Kelly it's a really good point you
could say these things but your actions
if they don't align with your words
bother people it's it's hypocritical and
you know to me that that really bothers
me and and humans are imperfect so I
don't want to be cynical but is this
ever going to end because we're
imperfect I mean maybe we'll all be
robots and we'll be Ai and we'll be like
you know calculated to not make shitty
decisions that would be interesting um
but that's how it is and we we mess
everything up in the end yeah I have a
there's a story I so I I one of the the
most genius managers I ever reported to
I haat politics like company politics it
bothers me think it like slows things
down I don't like how um you know I get
somebody who deeply does believe in
Merit politics I think is actually
counter to Merit and so I was
complaining to this person about
politics and he said something to me
I'll never forget he said well Nolan you
better get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] used to it because
company politics are
everywhere and I honestly at the time I
thought it was just ridiculous like I
thought less of him as a leader when he
told it to me and it took me years to
realize that he was right and that is
the imperfection of humanity that you're
referring to Kelly like it it just it
just is part of who we are humans are by
definition
imperfect and so I think what people are
really looking for here is just to call
that out out and to strive for like the
the higher goal like democracy like
democracy is very imperfect as well but
we are striving for that imperfect Union
like we want to get better every day and
I think honestly if Alex had just
included a line that like today we are
imperfect tomorrow we are imperfect but
we are striving to be better every day I
I think a lot of the detractors for this
post would not have much to stand on
yeah yeah I look I I I think we should
talk about this more um I think it's a
very hard situation and topic driven by
largely one's own experiences within any
organization and Leadership and things
that have happened to them or around
them that they've seen and those can be
either good things or they can be not
good things yeah um we have to start
thinking about these things in a more
complex manner like this is not a simple
I I yeah and I'm not the sharpest tool
in the shed or whatever but it's it's
not hard for me to see that the right
answer is a blend of things and even if
we blend them perfectly we can still
screw it up or we can do great things
with it and know that
too now I I want to make one other point
which is around um the expect
expectations of tech companies so I I
was thinking about this last night and
you know Google went public in 2004 and
they built literally the best business
model of all time they have a monopoly
the search um Apple similarly has almost
a monopoly on Hardware um these
companies print billions of dollars in
Revenue per quarter they have more than
hundred billion do in the bank they have
both stood on the hill and said diver
diversity is important to us we want to
invest in this we are willing to make
the tradeoff of diversity which is
taking more time in hiring they have the
luxury to be able to do these things
because of their business
model now my take is is that
expectations in Tech are driven by those
two
companies everybody knows somebody who
works at Apple or Google many people
have interviewed at Apple or Google and
had free during the day and those
expectations trickle down into the rest
of the tech
ecosystem and I think what we're seeing
now um given you know the the era of
interest rates being zero is over and
you know money is more expensive and
investors are squeezing CEOs and
Leadership teams for more profit and
more growth and more
revenue is now CEOs are saying like I
actually can't make this tradeoff of
moving slower because I I think that's
one of the things that I've I've tried
to talk about in the past and and maybe
I haven't delivered it very well but I
do think one of the aspects of if
diversity is important to you you have
to have a bigger top of
funnel and that bigger top of funnel
especially if you don't have a company
brand takes more time via
sourcing and time is a luxury that is
only afforded to you if you have money
or a great business and you could say we
are willing to wait and I think one of
the thing that that's currently
happening right now is companies are
saying we don't have to we are running
out of Runway like the economy is hard
it's harder than ever to close business
and so we just we need to move
faster what's your guys's take on that
do you guys agree with that oh
absolutely yeah I think companies are
are being pressured by investors by
their employees because a lot of times
employees they don't want to they don't
like to admit out loud like what I want
to do is to make a lot of money and I
want this company to be really
successful and I Want My Equity be worth
a lot but that's really how they how
many most the vast majority of people do
really feel so I think you know I was
talking to a nrat who was saying you
know scale just raised this big round
they're still only up 2x on versus when
they enjoined and that's you know still
great but compared to a lot of the rest
of the folks who were graduating a few
years prior that's not as much and all
of her friends were you know they
they're all flatter underwater and so I
think you know the revealed preferences
are coming out from investors as you say
but also from employees there's also a
calculation that the employees don't
actually want you to take more time
because they want your business to do
well because we all benefit from that uh
as
well and can you blame them I mean can
we blame them we we've lived in a world
I mean I've been a venture for 15 years
and you lead with valuation you hire
people based on scenario and
exits um and what that looks like every
All Hands we're talking about IPO
timelines like it's a thing we we've
burned that into people's brains and I'm
guilty of it too um that that's what you
lead with we we get gred on Equity price
again these scenarios how much am I
going to make what is it $5 $10 20 40 a
share people are calculated I mean
that's that's how it is and I've talked
to a lot of folks now where not you know
duckies and horsey anymore and you got
to work harder for Less a lot of times
and a lot of people are like gez I don't
love Tech that much well and you got to
make tradeoffs like it's just this is
the thing is nobody wants to accept the
tra in every decision you make there is
a downside
tradeoff and again Google and apple who
have have really like set this
expectation I think for all of Tech are
willing to wait they're willing to take
more time in recruiting that luxury I
think is no longer being afforded to the
the rest of tech who don't have
monopolized business models and I think
that's the that's where this rub is
really starting to happen is because
leadership teams are coming out and
saying like we need to grow or we're
going to die and that is that is just
objectively where we are in today's
economy and a lot of them want to
potentially swing and die before getting
acquired yeah especially acquired by a
PE firm which is a loss so you're
seeing you know desperation is a strong
word but you're seeing just last straws
of Sprints to avoid that yeah yeah and
I've had I've heard it employ complain
well we're not going to die but I I've
heard other you know Founders investors
say floating along you know half alive
is a fate worse than death as a company
um because at least if things are over
you can move on you can do the next
thing but you're kind of like uh that we
still have a couple years of Runway
maybe this new product will make us last
 
well so even if you're not you know if
you're play Thinking well my comp not
GNA die because of this h i I think
floating around around half aive is also
and and let's also empathize I mean that
is hard man that's a hard pill to
swallow 10 years of fun and money and
you know you barely shoot the ball and
it goes swish swish swish in the basket
and now it's like I mean I do empathize
how how crushing that can be yeah and
also for employees like this is the I
think the thing many employees are
starting to realize now too is that
winning is fun like winning is so fun
and losing sucks like being inside of a
company that isn't doing well sucks even
if you still have two to three years of
Runway it's terrible and killing
yourself killing yourself to lose sucks
more and it's like why why am I working
 
flopping Enterprise SAS company when I
can freaking work 40 somewhere else and
maybe make more money I mean it is it is
a wakeup call I think for a lot of folks
totally totally so this is the real
world that we're living in um look I I
appreciate both of you for engaging in
this discussion and and to our audience
please engage with this discussion like
everyone here is learning like we we
don't have the right answers all we have
are just experiments and ideas and so um
please engage with us and let us know
what you all think let us know what you
guys are trying so we can talk about it
on the show and share with everybody
what what people are working on so
