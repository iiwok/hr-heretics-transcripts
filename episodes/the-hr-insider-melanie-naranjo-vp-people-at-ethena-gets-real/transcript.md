# The HR Insider: Melanie Naranjo, VP People at Ethena Gets Real

## Transcript

 
yes of course EQ is very important I
actually had a manager who for years
just just just really explicitly
blatantly consistently shamed me for not
being emotional enough Melanie you need
more empathy and she just really drilled
into me that this was a bad thing for HR
you need to have emotions you need to
really care about happiness and I have
to say I actually have found that to be
an incredible weakness for people in the
HR field I think that the greatest value
you can bring when dealing with high
emotion situations is actually being
able to set your own emotions aside for
a second and look at things really
neutrally I think that uh high
functioning HR people they lead with

logic hey everybody welcome back to the
HR Heretics podcast where we get into
the real talk of company construction
these are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and board members behind closed doors
we're Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially as
it relates to people but on the show we
tell the truth and expect the same from
our guests today we're talking to
Melanie nanho which I'm so excited about
Melanie is currently the VP of people at
Athena which is an all-in-one compliance
training platform that helps HR teams
meet their compliance needs needs while
building better workplaces this was one
of my favorite conversations yet because
Melanie is incredibly candid and she's
in the seat today she talked a lot about
underperformance why they don't do Pips
at Athena as well as her relationship
with roxan Athena CEO it was a no BS
convo we talked about giving and
receiving feedback among leadership
teams what that looks like when it goes
wrong especially at the sea Suite level
what it feels like I especially love
Melanie's takes on the current sentiment
in HR why there's some bitterness in the
industry why people are experiencing
burnout and a loss of motivation and
what she thinks people need to be
thinking about going forward here's our
interview with Melanie please like
subscribe on YouTube Spotify and apple
as always share it with your friends and
enemies Melanie thanks for joining HR
Heretics we're so happy to have you
thanks for having me I'm really excited
to be chatting with you too today so
happy hell yeah so I actually want to
get into Athena first
so it's interesting that you are an HR
person at an HR company tell us a little
bit about Athena and how you met roxan
and that whole story please oh gosh it's
a wild fun ride so so Athena we're a
compliance company which uh let's just
put it out there that sounds pretty
boring if you think about it right okay
harassment prevention training not very
exciting right why did I join um I
joined because I'm a big fan of training
and development and they asked really
smart questions in the interview process
so on and so forth but what I think is
more interesting is is two things um one
is the truth is that when I joined
Athena roxan who's my CEO and and my
manager um she really did think that HR
was just Peril and benefits and for the
record she's been open about this and
she has since changed her mind but
what's fascinating to me on that front
is that we are literally an HR company
and even within sorry an HR tech company
and even Within an HR Tank Company who
is selling to HR buyers this is a this
is a misunderstanding this is an actual
problem um and so you know luckily
Roxanne had lots of humility asked lots
of questions she has since changed her
mind we work so closely together the
second thing reason why I think it's so
fascinating is because now now that we
are past that right now that we are you
know in sync we chat we really see each
other as um thought leaders and partners
and all of that stuff um the amount of
impact that I've been able to have from
the HR perspective given that I
literally am the person that we are
selling to has been just huge it's
phenomenal I'm hosting webinars we just
hosted our first ever conference we're
we're doing all these amazing things
that quite frankly I think too many
companies don't do because they don't
understand the power of their HR team
and so the journey really has been um
not an incredibly atypical one from the
beginning in the sense that I joined a
company there was misalignment around
one R person could do but I think
quickly became atypical in that they
were open they realized what an HR
person could do and now we've just been
working so so well together and I have
to say um for anyone who's unhappy at
their current job and is looking for a
better way I think working for an HR
tech company that gets the HR business
case it just takes such a load off your
your plate when you don't have to
constantly fight to prove the value of
HR that was that was so fun working at
when I was at hired another HR tech
company company and even now at pendo
because one of our products is pendo for
employees I mean you're just salesperson
a marketer product person all of that
it's it's it adds a whole another
element but is it actually fun right now
is it fun right now Melanie because like
HR budgets have been hammered and I'm
curious like is it actually fun right
now because it doesn't seem to me like
it would be fun you know what fair
question fair question I think that we
are very lucky in that we are in the a
Tech space that's required right
harassment prevention training is not
really optional you need it the question
is who are you going to use for it and
has that gotten trickier over time sure
but we we are in a fortunate position
now if you were to ask me you know if we
were in I don't know just general
training and development or if we were
in the ATS space um yeah that would be
very tough right now uh there's no
mincing words around that I mean
webinars are always fun Nolan they're
always fun yeah webinars are fun when
you're buyer can't buy anything though
I'm just saying I was on a customer call
this morning another one after this and
people still care about the employ
experience people still are hiring you
know it it has been sporadic and certain
parts of the industry have been hit but
it's still it's still important I think
I think that that's very real Melanie
given that you have spent a lot of time
I'm assuming spent a lot of time with
Athena's buyer tell us like what are
your general learnings of HR leaders and
what are your
takeaways oh that's such a great
question because I think there are so
many different uh categories of HR
leaders um you've got people who are
firsttime HR leaders maybe they've been
thrown into it unwillingly so I see this
quite often um you you joined as a
recruiter for a startup and suddenly
you're the head of HR but you've never
done anything in the HR space now you
need to advocate for HR things you're
responsible for hiring a compliance
provider you don't even know what the
compliance laws are so I think there's
that category of leader then there's a
leader who's you know they've been in
the game for a while they've been here
maybe 10 15 20 years and and they're
more thought leaders they're beyond that
but you know maybe they're sick of doing
all the admin stuff they don't want to
be thinking about your compliance or
your your another performance review
they're sort of like past that already
um my my take on it is that honestly I
think that we are all super disconnected
and we're not talking to each other um I
think there's a lot of a sense of
isolation I think there's a lot of um a
lot of bitterness happening and I have
all the empathy in the world that I just
I think that our jobs keep getting
harder and harder and we don't have an
outlet to to sort of um talk about some
of the things that we're struggling with
but I also think and again I say this
with all the empathy in the world I also
think that sometimes because we are so
siloed because we are so um uh desperate
uh we we sort of get in this cycle of
autopilot and dwelling in what's not
working versus hey this isn't working
let's do something different hey let's
let this isn't working let's find a
solution hey I'm really frustrated about
this do you know what I'm tired of
venting I'm going to actually do
something about it uh I I think I think
we're in this really tough spot right
now where people are really struggling
to sort of pull themselves out of that
that dark
place why do you think that is you
mentioned bitterness I absolutely
noticed this as is it's kind of like a
big theme right now in my from my
perspective in the HR Community why do
you think that is and I and I'd love to
know what does it look like Melanie like
what does it look and feel like what
does that mean so okay what I'll start
with the your question uh Kelly so I
think what it looks like is to be honest
I don't think that you always get the
best of us I think that sometimes we are
half-assing it sometimes we are just
doing the bare minimum mom to get by
because we are so burnt out we are so
exhausted and you know what the last
time I put my heart and soul into a
project it got vetoed or I got buying to
do it I spent three months working on it
and then at the last minute I got all
this push back and never mind it's not
going to happen go do something else
right and so again like I I always
approach with empathy I don't think
anyone's doing it intentionally but I
think understandably after months years
of this kind of response it ends up
looking like I'm just not going to give
you my all anymore because I I
physically mentally cannot anymore now
in terms of knowing your question I
think you know I think we have to take a
step back to really understand the full
context here which is this is my opinion
okay I think HR is a really unique
industry in that or or field in that up
until I want to say the last few years I
don't think most people sort of grew up
dreaming of being an HR I don't think HR
was sort of this you know uh this fancy
title that's what you want to be you
know your parents are pro you know
encouraging you to do this I think HR
was a field and a function that people
sort of fell into either because they
couldn't find something else they
weren't sure what else they wanted to do
somebody saw some empathy in them and
they were like clearly you must be in HR
and for the record I put myself in this
bucket I didn't dream of being in HR I
liter right I I literally could not get
anything else I was like please somebody
hire me and HR was the only one that was
interested okay um and so I think you
bring together a bunch of people who
might not necessarily have been
passionate about this thing and for the
record I want to be fully cognizant and
understanding of the fact that some
people did some people got their
master's degrees for this right um but
many people did not you just kind of
fell into it so I think you you put
together a bunch of people who maybe
this wasn't even their dream to begin
with then on top of that you don't
really Empower them so you say hey you
got a bunch of responsibility but no
Authority your your Authority comes with
the power to influence that's your
Authority and so then then right after
you give them this responsibility they
bring things to you they don't do it in
the right way say for example they just
don't have business savvy so they think
that an effective business case is
because the employees would really like
it I just I got the vibe they're really
upset and I think this would make them
happy and then what happens the CEO
dismisses them because they're not
speaking the CEO's language they're
using terms like happiness they're using
terms like it feels like the right thing
to do of course they're being dismissed
right but no one takes the time to give
them that feedback explicitly and say
hey let me explain to you why your case
was significantly less compelling than
the case that our head of sales just
brought to me nobody does that so we
just get in the cycle of feeling
disempowered um not not getting ahead no
one giving us the feedback on how to get
better and eventually understandably we
just assume well either I suck or they
just don't get me so I'm going to give
up that's a very common cycle and
pattern of behavior that I have
unfortunately witnessed um and and you
know it's it's it's unfortunate because
I think that there's so much more we can
do in the world of HR and we just
haven't pushed it I think the bar has
been low for a really long time and I
think it's coming from all sides I think
it's coming from people not empowering
us and I think it's coming from us
really struggling to continue to push
ourselves when we're just not getting uh
any sort of support or affirmation I
mean the most common measurement of
success in HR is oh I didn't get any
employee complaints it must have been
okay I guess it was fine because people
aren't angry right like that I
understandably people are going to lose
Steam and motivation we'll be right back

have you ever had a negative experience
hiring an executive I certainly did at
Carta and door Das and that's why I
started Continuum the modern AI powered

interest and show up in your inbox it's
like magic there's no platform fee or
hidden cost you only pay the person you

you're thinking about hiring an exec in
the middle of a search right now or
don't know how to solve a problem I get
it scaling is hard companies like
athletic greens weights and biases
misari and more than a hundred other
tech companies have turned to Continuum
for help solving their P Ops go to
market engineering and finance
challenges so check out Continuum in the
description below ping me on LinkedIn if
you have any questions or head to join
continuum. generally speaking you'd
assume those of us in HR heads of people
have high EQ right we have good
intuition we
empathize and it's also one of those
roles where you can't just go do stuff
right like I know salesperson just go do
it I got this and they just kind of like
paint and they go and we we have to be a
lot more methodical you have to win
hearts and Minds you have to influence
people and that takes a big toll I mean
it's a different weight of of stuff here
and you're right when it keeps getting
shut down down down down and you have
high EQ I mean you're kind of like why
am I going to keep running my head
against the wall that that that
phenomenon I think is very real I
actually have a pretty strong opinion on
something you just said in terms of the
the EQ side of things yes of course EQ
is very important we need to have it
right it's a muscle you learn if you
don't have it naturally and also I
actually had a manager who for years
just just just really explicitly
blatantly consistently shamed me for not
being emotional enough Melanie you need
more empathy Melanie this person said
this thing and I didn't see a single
emotion cross your face and she just
really drilled into me that this was a
bad thing for HR you need to have
emotions you need to really care about
happiness you all these things and I
have to say I have to say I actually
have found that to be an incredible
weakness for people in the HR field I
think that the greatest value you can
bring when dealing with high emotion
situations is actually being able to set
your own emotions aside for a second and
look at things really neutrally I think
that uh high functioning HR people
actually don't lead with their emotions
they lead with logic they lead with um
you know with data statistics I don't
think you know I think it's actually I
agree again we we need to have high EQ
and also I actually think it's it's just
wrong when people are sort of like oh
you're an emotional person you like
empathize a ton you would be great in HR
actually I don't know that you would be
great in HR because there are going to
be a lot of high stress emotional
situations and you might end up taking
sides you might not be able to handle it
um and so yeah it's for me that's
something that I think about a lot just
because again it's personal to me but
but I remember being shamed for not
being quote unquote emotional enough and
I just I have not found that to be a
thing that has actually held me back in
my career that is so well said Melanie
it's not about it's I think it's
actually about emotional
regulation and also using logic to solve
problems because typically when emotion
is involved Stakes are high and problem
is probably really big and and so in
order to solve that problem having
emotional maturity to stay in control of
those emotions to deescalate folks and
then to switch the the mode in our brain
into more of logic problem solving I
think gets things done significantly
faster with less you know bodies in the
wake and so I I I totally agree with you
but I don't see like the HR Community
pushing for what you just said and I'm
I'm left wondering like why that is the
case and why your opinion is not more
widely
shared that's a great question I mean do
you know what I'll answer it but I'm
curious to hear what you two think
actually well and I had a question on
community because I feel like every time
I look up there's a this community or
this group this Alias this organization
and yet I think you're right there's
still a lot of silos so I'm also
wondering like what is the nut to crack
here like you know and then and the
conversations those communities have
they're very different than when Nolan
calls me and we just kind of like go at
it and talk about real things so I want
to know what what that is isn't that
interesting Kelly right so I'll answer
it first I think that there's a
monoculture in HR that is
accepted and then anything outside of
that
monoculture that doesn't appeal to HR
safety is the way I would describe it so
making HR leaders feel safe with their
venting is it's thought of as like well
you're on the outside and you're not
here to help us that's my personal
belief in what I've experienced okay
okay spicy I love it okay Kelly that's
why we're here that's why we're here but
you said something early to answer your
question Melanie about expectations
uh and I think a lot of people to your
point fell into HR right and to me
following that thread logically if you
fall into something that means you
haven't really thought about it a ton
maybe you don't have a super strong
point of view on what it is and so the
expectations of others imprint on you
and you become that thing if that makes
sense I mean Nolan we talked about this
with Patty in episode one it's not just
the expectations of your HR boss but
some of these HR people get thrashed
around by the very different multiple
sets of Expectations by the freaking
employees like I've seen HR people get
rattled like an employee is like you are
this you should be this you should be a
therapist you should be right we talked
about knitting HR sweaters last episode
like you should be the mother hen and
that's the job and I've seen that in
Impact people right and I do think
there's an element of having your feet
cement Ed in with a very strong point of
view on what this job is or isn't and I
think people get
swayed I think both of you present valid
points I think I agree with P elements
of what you've both said I think where
my mind goes is in two directions um one
being around that intentionality piece
and adding to that I don't think that
there's a whole lot of formal education
around the concept of HR I think to your
point Kelly people get thrown in right
and sort of like figure it out and I
don't want to hear about this just make
the problem go away there's no
intentional let's think about what an
effective HR philosophy looks like let's
think about how to effectively manage
emotions in the moment there's none of
that it's just sort of like oh that's
that's an HR thing you go handle it
right oh you did a bad job but I'm not
going to give you any specifics as to
why just like go fix it next time right
so I think there's a bit of that right
there's not this education there's there
just isn't very much in terms of support
and guidance and intentionality
I think my spicier take which I always
try to be really careful in my wording
here because I think it could land
poorly and be received incorrectly is I
think that there is a gendered element
to this and what I mean by that is if
you look at the demographic of the HR
function the majority of us identify as
women um many of us identify as women of
color and the reason that I say that I
think there can be a gendered element is
if you look around a room of executive
right there might often times just be
one woman in that executive room and
it's the head of HR right and I think
often times what can happen is if
someone is not presenting something in a
way that lands uh or that in the in a
way that that person would have
presented it um they just dismiss the
person right instead of having a real
intentional conversation about it and I
think too often this happens to HR
people and too often it happens to HR
women and too often it happens to HR
women of color I've personally
experienced I cannot say for a fact that
it was because I'm a woman or because
I'm a woman of color but I can say that
there is very much a gender Dynamic when
you are the only woman in a senior room
and you say something and everyone just
looks at you like that was a dumb idea
but no one explains why right and so I
think to go back to the point of like oh
you know we just get in this Silo of you
know no one's listening to me you you
just must be on the other side you don't
get it I think I think it goes two ways
right on the one hand HR we need to be
better at communicating and articulating
our thoughts and understanding our
audience and on the other hand other
people need to be better about
communicating to us hey I thought your
idea was dumb let me explain why right I
thought you did a terrible job of
advocating for your initiative let me
explain to you why but no one does that
we just say oh you know that was dumb
I'm just going to tune you out the next
time you present something at a meeting
right right and I can't I can't Overlook
the fact that often times the people
dismissing identify with one gender
versus another and the people presenting
identify with one gender versus another
so I think that we do need to think
about power dynamics of all kinds when
we are talking about um when we're
talking about HR and in relation to any
other uh department and and the overall
executive team I I think that that's
excellently said and I would also say in
general human are terrible at giving
each other constructive
feedback and it's really interesting
because you would expect as somebody
Rises at to be an executive that they
get better at this but in fact I I don't
think it's actually they don't think
they do get better uh and oftentimes
they get worse and it comes off as like
passive aggressiveness when you're not
getting actual feedback on your
performance and how you're doing in
meetings what we've actually done at
Continuum is we because people are
generally bad at this we have a back
stop which is every six weeks we do
synchronous feedback with the entire
executive
team and so we spend an hour and a half
to two hours going around the room you
start with like a self assessment it's
all you know it's just we're talking
we're not writing anything down and that
has led to not only I think improvements
in performance but it's also led to just
awareness of how your colleagues are
feeling you're doing versus we get into
like really busy mode at work and then
we don't talk about things that we have
to actually talk about especially as a
leadership team it also erodes the trust
right there there's a trust element to
that and a safety element to your point
earlier that's that's a big deal I mean
I I in my career about you Melanie Nolan
but it's also this like cabal thing that
happens and I I call it like do you all
have conversations above the table or do
you have them under after like in diad
or Triad chats or texts like is is it
all above board or is it this weird
thing where like something happens like
people kind of ignore Melanie in a
meeting and then like two other you know
insecure executive team members get win
that maybe Melanie's on the out so uh
this it's real and it's it's it's
immature and these are Executives and
these are adults but I'm telling you the
insecurities sometimes the greed some
times the ego I don't know like the
cocktail changes company to company but
I've seen it it's very dysfunctional and
that was
like honestly my main um filter I would
I would talk to founder CEOs or vet out
new opportunities around this Dynamic
that you can't really measure and you
can barely touch it and feel it but it's
a tsunami when it happens and it's
brutal couldn't agree more we were
talking about this just before uh
earlier today um in terms of so I firmly
believe that people will fill in the
gaps and I think it's just human nature
right we're trying to make sense of
things we want to understand things and
so if something is unspoken we will fill
it in with our own assumptions and I
think it's perfectly understandable I'm
not saying it's right or the the right
approach that people should take but I
think it makes sense that you know if
some if I present something and nobody
comments or or people just say like some
positive stuff but they don't have any
real conversations I'm going to fill in
the gaps with okay either they don't
trust that I can take the feedback or
they weren't even listening or they you
know they've all decided that I'm
already bad at my job you know I'm going
to fill in those gaps because no one is
saying anything and so in the absence of
communication all these horrible
misunderstandings and assumptions get
made and it it's wild and to your point
yeah it doesn't matter how senior you
are we all do this it it continues to
happen it never I have yet to see the
the most senior person I have yet to see
anyone who doesn't fall uh to
unfortunately these really poor habits
so I guess the question is how do you
defend against it so we we kind of have
like a a ritual in which every six weeks
we do it most leadership teams don't
give feedback that regularly I think
another thing you could potentially do
is just to ask for feedback from your
colleagues and I find that for again for
whatever reason you know potentially it
is like human ego which is very fragile
we're so scared to do it and to like put
ourselves out there um I I think that is
a way to potentially defend against not
understanding how your colleagues are
actually feeling about you versus
filling in gaps in with our own stories
because we all tell ourselves stories
when we don't know I'm curious to get
your take on that Melanie I think yes I
I you know I agree that we should be be
soliciting feedback and that is the
solution and also I think the problem is
probably a little deeper than that I
think that so many leadership teams are
so entrenched in politics and working
against each other instead of with each
other that one I don't think most people
want to ask for their fellow exec's
opinion because they personally don't
even care for it they're like you're
wrong I already don't like you I think
you're bad at your job you were passive
aggressive in that last meeting your
opinion quite frankly doesn't matter to
me and second I think tied into those
politics right no no no no no this is
leverage you're going to use against me
I don't want to be vulnerable with you
right now I'm presenting you know a
tough front I think there are actually
some some teper issues that most
leadership teams would probably need to
work through before they even got to the
point of being comfortable asking a
question and I think it's it's beyond
ego in my opinion that's exactly what I
was describing that this this like
politics gone bad situation and you know
I often like we never leave middle
school that's kind of like it's like oh
my God like literally looking at my
 
though I think that at those companies
there's someone who's pushing that
agenda do you know what I mean like that
happens because a CEO is rewarding right
okay took the words right out of my
mouth like it it always stems from that
right are you allowing this to happen
are you exacerbating it are you biased
and some exact members versus others or
and I will give toddles and pendo CEO a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of credit here the guy doesn't
care the guy doesn't care where you came
from if you've been there eight years a
month if you go to dinner and drinks if
you don't he he literally I don't know
if it's just a chip in his head is not
there he doesn't play into this and I
think it's phenomenal I mean it
literally has created an atmosphere
where you know that if you politic all
damn day long you're still not going to
get leverage because the guy just sees
everyone it's it's it's great um and how
do we create more of that right and if
you don't have that microchip or not
have it in his case I don't know which
one um how are you leaning on your your
HR leader someone that you trust to call
your stuff out and make sure that it's
healthy because once that room becomes
unhealthy it all flows down from there I
I totally I that's exactly the question
I was going to ask which is when you
don't have somebody like Todd who's the
the CEO I think what you're describing
Kelly by the way is an idea of
meritocracy like to where it's just
about the ideas and the Merit of those
ideas versus where they come from or who
said it that's that's that's where I
think it gets really toxic is like oh
only ideas from this person are okay
versus like we evaluate all ideas on
their Merit when you don't have a Todd
as your CEO then how do you solve that
problem in my mind it's basically just
like you have to try and terminate the
person who's causing the toxicity or
leave am I missing something in that
logic well I would I would add that I
don't actually think it's just about
being a meritocracy I think it's about
having a clear and aligned Vision which
I know sounds very frr but I mean very
specifically right I think most
companies there's a tendency to favor
one Department over another so the sales
team is the most important or the
engineering team is the most important
right and and I think that that that
then stir up these issues right like
yeah but how does this benefit the sales
team how is this ultimate do you know I
mean as opposed to no no no we are
united team and we have a company goal
how is any idea that we are presenting
ultimately helping the company because
if a sales leader comes in and they say
we want to do X Y and Z but then the Cs
team is going to fall apart because they
can't support this thing that you are
asking them to do or the engineering
team can't keep up with what it is that
you're asking them to produce then you
have other problems start to fall to to
come into play and things start to fall
apart I I think where it needs to start
is do we are we as a company aligned on
what our singular goal is and how it is
that we get there and then any idea that
gets brought to the table needs to needs
to ultimately feed into that goal not
not be pitting us against each other
right right and and you
know sometimes not but usually right if
you ask that founder CEO like what is
this well they're not good they're not
performing well that that's fine and
that very well may be true but that's a
different conversation and a different
how than what might be going on with
this phenomenon that we're talking about
of either ignoring them or avoiding them
right and it's just not it's just not a
good way of doing business because what
does that do it actually impacts the
business I mean you look at people feel
like they've been treated wrongly right
now we have lawsuits now we have
wrongful terminations now we I mean it
just doesn't lead to good things all
around I I will say when there's a
performance issue it is important that
you act really quickly as quickly as
possible and as transparently and
directly as possible uh Adena we have so
we have these three questions that we
have all managers ask themselves of
their teams every I don't know like
let's say once a quarter periodically
but the idea is they know these in the
back of their mind all the time um it's
is this person ultimately making my job
easier or harder if I could go back in
time knowing what I know today would I
hire them again and if they were to quit
today how would I feel panicked relieved
neutral and the idea of that is to
remove the emotional element cuz often
times if you ask someone is someone a
high performer you get all these like
hemming and ha like well well this
they're really good at this but you know
they're really nice and well they
they're good for morale like no no no no
no no I didn't hire them for morale I
hired them to get the job done so tell
me ultimately are they getting their job
done and so we found that these
questions are a really good starting
point to sort of eliminate some of that
emotion but but I will say I think the
most important thing is it helps you act
quickly because you know I've seen some
real horror stor where you think you're
doing someone a favor by dragging it out
by sugarcoating it and meanwhile this
person is miserable their morale is
being consistently beat down for months
sometimes I've seen it go on for years
where they're just being told like
constantly here's everything you did
wrong here's everything you did wrong
but we're not explicitly saying you're
not meeting expectations your job is on
the line if you're not if this isn't
turned around in two months you're not
going to be here anymore it doesn't help
anyone um and so yeah I will say when
those performance issues start to creep
up you just got to say it you got to rip
off that band-aid and not just for the
not not just for that employee it's also
for everyone else on the team who's
having to carry their weight because
they're not doing the work for the
manager who's having multiple endless
conversations about this performance
issue when that manager could be doing
so much else and for that employee who
quite frankly it could even be that this
is just not the right company for them
and they would be thriving somewhere
else but you're not giving them that
opportunity because you're stringing
them along there just so many problems
that come into play when you're not
direct and upfront and quick with
performance issues you wrote an article
about this titled the cost of tolerating
underperformance and overlooking your
high
performers and I'm what was the insight
for you writing that
article oh so yeah that's a great
question I you
know in full transparency Athena is a
company that Prides itself on high
performance uh and it's part of our
compensation philosophy we pay topof
Market because we we require topof
market performance that that is the deal
right we're going to pay you a lot of
money but you better be the best of the
best otherwise you can't stay here and
we're pretty we're pretty upfront and
direct about this which I do think for
the record is very important some
companies say this but then they don't
stand by it or they do it but then they
don't tell anyone in the interview
process and then the person thinks
they're coming into a regular company
right Athena is the kind of company
where you can't just be okay at your job
you have to be phenomenal you have to be
amazing you have to be the kind of
candidate that our peer companies would
be fighting over right that's the deal
now what spurred this on is we realized
that unfortunately you know there were a
couple of months well I would say like
half a year to a year where we realized
we didn't think that we were actually
holding up our end of the bargain we
didn't actually think that we were
holding people accountable we thought we
were because we have a feedback heavy
culture every other Friday we require
managers and direct reports to meet and
give each other feedback and they were
giving each other feedback but we
realized that everyone was being just a
little bit too lenient right you're
really nice person I can tell that
they're trying but we weren't actually
doing the thing and so so really what we
we we realized was this was having a
ripple effect right people were upset
people were complaining our actual High
performers were doing less their their
work was impacted because they were
upset they were tired of doing twice the
work because the other person on team
wasn't doing their job and so you know
in in full transparency this came out
because we weren't doing what we said we
were going to do and so we really wrote
this to sort of like commit to it
publicly but also um it it was something
that we wanted to put out there to our
employees and so after we did that we
put it out to the rest of the world as
well and it's a resetting of
expectations for everybody internally
and it serves as a magnet and deterrent
for all candidates externally yes which
I think is important I think oftentimes
people think that uh the interview
process is just about selling and it is
a little bit about selling but it's also
about making sure that you're scaring
away people who wouldn't do well at your
company because quite frankly I would
rather that you walk away from this
process now than walking away three
months in because you realize this isn't
what you thought you signed up for so
then I guess clicking in as it relates
to low performance at Athena do you guys
do Pips do you guys believe in Pips or
or do you try and avoid the PIP process
entirely this is s i find that this
tends to be so controversial people feel
really strongly about this we don't do
Pips we don't do Pips and I think
personally my opinion is that most
people do Pips for liability reasons
they just want to have a thing kind of
documented right but I think that Pips
oftentimes can just be an excuse for I
haven't been giving you feedback for a
really long time so now retroactively
I'm going to put it all out there um I
also think Pips are incredibly
demoralizing it's sort of like hey for
the record in like 30 days we're
probably going to fire you but um you
know here's what you can try to do and
maybe keep your I just don't find that
to be an effective way to do anything
other than to manage some it's totally
c yeah 100 in which case you might as
well just say listen you've got two
options you can try or you can take a
separation package which one do you want
I don't see why we have to sort of play
this song and dance around like you know
let's pretend that that we actually
believe in this um we don't do that at
Athena we're pretty direct we we have
regular feedback discussions but when
someone's job is on the line um our
managers are explicitly required to say
you are not meeting expectations and
after a couple of weeks if things still
haven't improved they will say they're
required to say listen your job is
currently at risk and if I don't see
Improvement in the next few weeks the
reality is we're going to be having a
different conversation about whether or
not you can continue to stay employed at
the company and we do this again for
full transparency for so that the person
actually has a chance to turn things
around to ask questions and by the way I
meet with people when this happens hey
your manager has told me that you're
having some performance issues let's
talk about it because for all I know
maybe they're struggling to manage up
maybe there's an underlying issue that
they haven't spoken up about and I can
help but but no we don't do Pips we just
do really candid feedback and then you
know eventually we make a tough decision
if necessary or people turn things
around and for the record sometimes
people turn things around yeah people
used to come to me and say hey I I want
to let go of this employee I need to put
them on a pip I'm like okay like show me
the show me the documentation or talk me
through like the feedback and show me
the emails you know where you summarize
that and had some contracts over the
past two months or whatever oh no I
don't I don't have those well well that
that is the PIP so we're not g to do the
PIP that is the PIP we should have
another accur for that do you do you
ever have a problem with your brand
internally given that that's your stance
okay so it's really funny because I just
we've just done a round of stay
interviews and uh I haven't even shared
this with employees yet but it's fine uh
uh we just did around a state of news
and we actually found that um our
rigorous
accountability uh is actually one of the
selling points for Athena people love
knowing that everyone that they are
working with is really putting in the
hard work and that they are not the only
one carrying the weight they love
knowing that when there's a problem we
will address it swiftly um literally I
had employees tell me I like that when
someone is underperforming we don't let
it go on for too long they like it
because guess what who who who is
impacted by their underperformance they
are exactly and so they actually really
really appre and think about it I mean
let's be real how many times have you
worked at a company you look around the
room and you know that person's slacking
that person didn't do the thing why am I
busting my ass when these other people
aren't what's the it's demoralizing and
so yeah we we actually really haven't
had it now have certain people maybe not
applied to work at Athena because of
this probably but we think that's a good
thing right like that's good thank you
for knowing that this is not right for
you no worries find a better company for
you no again totally fine I mean back to
the executives when we started this
conversation back like not great about
giving feedback I mean feedback is just
it's amazing how easy it is when you're
just Direct
but also just talking to the person like
a human right direct but equal hey like
what do you think I I'm concerned this
isn't working what do you want to do
versus you are missing you I mean it's
just the sometimes the approach and the
tone is most of it it's not actually the
feedback or the outcome totally and I
will say most people kind of suck at
feedback they just don't know how to go
into specifics they lead with emotions
it's very vague you know it's again
going back to my manager you're just not
empath atic enough what what does that
mean and how is that tied into the
business how's that part of my job you
know I think most people just they're
not specific enough and so then
understandably that person can't even
receive the feedback yep so well it's
not the most enjoyable of topics I mean
just as humans it's not I want to wake
up today and do this it takes a lot of
energy for people it it does Kelly but
we like humans when when we don't get
excited about something especially like
the tougher topics we tend to try and
like put them under the rug and just
kind of like hope they go away and it's
actually way worse in that world than it
is with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dealing with it and I
know I have a saying it's lean into the
awkwardness and try to have a little fun
you have to do it it's just part of the
deal uh Melanie I want to speaking of
brand you now have more than 35,000
followers on LinkedIn I feel like you're
part of this newer age leader that is
using social to amplify not only your
own personal platform but also your
company's platform talk to us about like
like how how do you do it how how did
you grow so fast and what does this look
like what are the big takeaways for our
audience let me start with the
disclaimer that uh I'm not a social
media person like in my personal life I
don't do Instagram I don't have Tik Tok
it's not for me it's not for me I didn't
honestly it was terrifying posting on
LinkedIn um I did it to your point for
my company because I wanted to help
build brand awareness I realized that
the audience we're selling to is the
audience I'm connected with and so
that's really where it came from um and
I'll be honest and go a step further and
just say I didn't think I had much of
value to share you know and and and
here's the thing I think that's really
common in HR because again when we
succeed we just don't hear anything in
response that's a successful initiative
nobody complained right and so a lot of
the thoughts that I put out there on
LinkedIn to be honest I'll share with my
employees and they'll be like crickets
no responses it's fine no big deal um
but but okay so to answer your question
you know I
think I think it's really important to
think about why it is that you're
putting yourself out there on LinkedIn
because they're pros and cons right I
think sometimes it's a bit of an
emotional roller coaster as is anything
with social media right you start to
sort of um look at the likes and you
look at the reshares and you start to
measure your own sense of worth and self
value based on that um and I think
unfortunately um sometimes people go
into it just to you know get LinkedIn
famous or whatever and I get it I get it
but I think people can feel that and
they see that and I think it tends to be
a harder struggle a lot of times people
just do polarizing things that's what
I'm going to do and um you know that
that only has so much runway and also
you need to think about your future
employability and the the the content
that you were putting out there and how
people are going to receive that um for
me it's been a really Incredible Journey
of just being able to be more thoughtful
around the things that I do and why I do
them uh in particular you know sometimes
I'll have a gut you know a knee-jerk
reaction to something maybe I don't like
something but I don't know why I don't
like it or maybe quite frankly an
employee pisses me off and I'm like H
why why am I so angry about this thing I
really shouldn't be and the process of
writing it out has been incredibly
helpful and that's really what LinkedIn
has been for me is to just like put my
thought processes out there and really
think through some of the things that
sometimes I'm wrong about um but you
know I just had that emotional reaction
and so um yeah putting it out there on
LinkedIn is really helpful I I will say
I met you at HR transform I don't know
if you remember this but I Met You in
roxan you guys were up your your booth
and you and roxan were actually jamming
on a LinkedIn post together were we and
I I've never seen like a CEO and chro do
this obviously it's core to your growth
and how you guys are building a business
but what I find most interesting about
your content is it's authentic and it's
real it's not this like fluff [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
thing um and I think that's my take on
why you've grown so fast is because
you're actually saying things that it's
it's less about controversial and like
trying to like spread that way it's more
of just like this is the real stuff
that's going on let me put it into the
world to get other people's perspective
and takes and watching you and rockan do
it in real time was it was a really cool
experience for me because I was like I
think that this is like the future of
how a chro and a CEO actually works
together because social growth is
huge fingers crossed and you're not
wrong um we have made so many new
customers through Linkedin I've made so
many new connections and learned things
and I will say I think you're exactly
right I think oftentimes unfortunately
in the HR world we use these really
broad generic terms like you know you
know best in-class culture or like yeah
I don't know like I I can't even think
of it like performance something you
know and it's just HR Bingo HR Bingo
yeah it's just like all these vague
things and it isn't the reality of what
we deal with day-to-day like I want to
know a very specific thing like for
example once the last time that you
spent three months working on a project
that your leadership team okay only to
veto it at the last minute right it's
like these very specific things that
people can identify with and I think I
think you're exactly right I think
that's why people Vibe I will also say
all the Credit in the world to roxan as
my CEO
because what you saw in real time is
real like that happens all the time we
are vibing with each other we genuinely
respect each other we hype each other up
I will comment and repost her stuff she
will comment and repost my stuff and I
think quite frankly people are hungry
for that they're hungry to see that oh a
head of HR and CEO can actually get
along can actually support and Empower
each other I just I I I think it's a
rarity to be
honest and problem Sol and problem
solved together
and so just really fast on this one is
there anything special you did in the
interview process with roxan to vet that
relationship you know what um so I'm
going to be completely candid and say I
don't think that I asked spicy enough
questions in the interview process so
I'll tell you the questions that I think
I should have asked and then I'll tell
you what actually happened okay so I
think so you're telling us you just got
lucky I got lucky I got lucky so so I
think the questions I should have asked
are you know what value do you think
that the the people team brings to a
company or why are you hiring this role
or give me a time when you disagreed
with AE of people and how you manage
that disagreement I think I should have
asked questions like that um instead I
just got lucky but but here's the thing
that I think I like to think
subconsciously I was looking for which
was humility flexibility curiosity
because like I said at the beginning the
reality is roxan did think that uh
people was just Peril and benefits and
that could have gone really poorly for
me if she had been rigid in that
perspective um but luckily over time you
know I was able to win her over now I
will say I will say I think it's
something to be careful about because
the reality is I think I think most okay
actually yes I do really want to talk
about about this for a second so I've
been talking to a lot of people in the
HR space who are looking for work and
really struggling and I think in part
I'm hearing you know it's because
rightfully so they're being a lot
pickier they're being a lot more
selective about the kind of CEO and
leadership team that they want to
partner with makes sense and also I
think unfortunately it overlooks the
fact that the reality is too many
leadership teams and CEOs they don't get
it they've never had a good HR partner
they don't know what a good HR partner
looks like they're not aware of the
value that nature person can bring to
the team and so if you are just weeding
people out who can't give you a perfect
answer I think you're going to lose out
on a lot of potential for good
Partnerships I would have lost out on
the potential for working with roxan
because quite frankly she would not have
had a good answer for me and she would
tell you that herself okay that's
interesting yeah I think I think so and
so I think that yes we should be asking
for these smart questions because like
wouldn't it be amazing if you did find a
CEO who already knew this that checks
all the boxes yeah yes yes but in the
absence of that what if instead you
checked for people who were flexible
people who were curious people who
wanted you to teach them I think that
that could open up significantly more
doors what do you think about back
channeling a CEO right that that
checkbox I'd love I mean both of your
opinions on that I think I think it's a
helpful data point yeah it's I think it
is just really fast on what Melanie just
said you're describing intellectual
nimbleness and I don't know how to
assess for that and I think for Kelly's
question is right it's like maybe back
channels is is potentially the best way
but Mel I'm curious like how do you
think about assessing for intellectual
nimbleness during an
interview well I think you could do two
things you could test them on the spot
what's a big thing that you're working
on well if I was here this is what I
would do what do you think and just see
what their reaction is in the moment
obvious viously in any interview people
can present themselves differently but
you can see in real time what their
response would be I think the other is
you'd have to think about real
thoughtful behavioral questions around
this maybe put it in terms that are uh
more relatable more easily relatable to
them think about it in terms of how they
might have handled this with a sales
leader that they were in disagreement
with for example um because if you can
see that they were curious about their
sales leader about someone else I think
you can start to um pick that up I I
think also really important talking to
the other members of the leadership team
to see what they think about the uh the
nimbleness the intellectual nimbleness
and curiosity of the CEO to the question
of back channeling I will share because
somebody recently changed my mind on
this I for a long time was adamantly
against back channeling um I think there
are a lot of you know challenges and
risks with that I won't get into it but
I will say somebody did convince me and
say that you know once you're at the
exec level
back channeling is fine because you know
what at that point you've had plenty of
time to build your credibility to not
burn Bridges to do the right thing to
build a reputation I think if you want a
back Channel CEO they've put themselves
out there you know that that I think at
that point it's totally fine interesting
so you're saying for
non-exec you don't like you don't like
back channeling as a practice I'm not a
fan I'm not a fan do am I saying that
there are never exceptions or times when
maybe somebody should do it I don't know
it's Case by case but is it my go-to not
not particularly why though it's such a
great data point I think there's a lot
of risk for bias especially a junior
level employee I think you know if you
think about what if it's just a
pissed-off manager what if it's a gender
Dynamic that person hasn't had a chance
to build up their credibility to have
enough experience and opportunities to
have somebody who can vouch for them
positively I think the more Junior you
get the riskier it is is and also I
think the more Junior you get you can
get that information from the person
directly that you need I totally agree I
mean when I was 30 if I got back
channeled but if someone back chn me now
I am who I am for the last seven eight
years so I I think that that is true
Melanie give me feedback on this so one
of the
things uh I I I agree that back
channeling can ultimately get a biased
take but one of the things I like to do
with candidates is to tell them we're
going to back Channel them and just to
stop
talking and by doing that I tend uh I
tend to find that candidates will
immediately fill in the gaps of like no
don't do that and and here's here's why
with a really good reason or like yeah
you should do that and like here's a
couple of people you should talk to that
for me is like quite an Illuminating
process do you think that removing the
asymmetry of like you know the employer
is going to back Channel and it's like
this secretive process would would
potentially alleviate the bias
concern yeah I think so I think the
transparency and directness and giving
them the space to say something helps a
lot I do think that you would have to
facilitate that a little bit and not
just rely on that person speaking up you
know some people might be might just
like freeze up and not say I'm going to
explain myself right be like hey I'm
going to do this for the record before I
do this you know do you have any
questions is there anything that I
should know that you haven't shared yet
if you did that I would feel much more
comfortable with the process or F or
folks we should avoid talking
to yeah yeah all right Melanie I want to
transition into our talent rules section
and so the first question is uh what is
the best interview question that you use
to get signal on candidates oo okay my
favorite question is um so it's sort of
a play on like you know what's the
biggest mistake you've ever made so on
and so forth um it's um what is the time
that you received feedback you know
what's the worst uh how uh oh gosh I'm
like flubbing it right now um what's the
time that you received feedback poorly
but I think the follow-up question is
the most important part which is ex walk
me through your thought process on why
that feedback was so hard for you to
receive and why you handled it so poorly
because I think the why is more
important like we've all received
feedback poorly in the past I want to
understand what you're ERS are I want to
understand what you're sensitive about I
want to understand what context will
throw you off and how you handle like
that's what I'm curious about not the
mistake that you made but more about
like the why what drives you that's damn
good I love that I like it too tell me
about the best hire you've ever made and
why oh gosh that's such a that's such a
hard one I think there's so many good
hires I will say there's a special place
in my heart for um my first ever hire
when I became a manager
and I I think I got something so special
with her that to be honest I don't know
that I've ever been able to replicate in
exactly the same way she was just so
hungry for knowledge she was just so
hungry to to learn new things and I
think in part because she was so Junior
and fresh like she was straight out of
college she was like teach me all the
things and I think that gets harder the
more senior you get because people have
already been biased and influenced from
all their other experiences I think you
know more you get people are already
their own people they're it's a little
bit less uh less easy it's a little bit
harder to sort of um mold them into
something different um this the being
able to hire someone Junior and really
be their first experience and influence
I think it's an incredible privilege and
it really can reap such great rewards
Melanie this was incredible thank you so
much for sharing your learnings with us
before we let you go it's it's coming
into 2024 do you have any advice for
people leaders going into next
 
year my question uh my my thought my
recommendation would be twofold one find
your space for release I think there's a
lot of pent up stress and bitterness as
we talked about and sometimes I think we
release these places in the wrong at the
wrong time in the wrong place I think
find your place for release whether
that's your own people community whether
that's at home with your friends and
then
two put aside the emotion and focus on
the solution in a really logical way if
your you know if your leadership team
has been you know shooting down all your
initiatives instead of saying oh my gosh
why do they never listen to my
initiatives why not just say hey I
haven't been able to convince you and
the past three times that I rolled out
an initiative be straight with me why
not what would have made it better how
could I have won you over instead of
getting up in our heads and sort of uh
wallowing in what's not working and
again I have empathy I understand why it
happens realizing that that's not going
to solve the problem pause and have a
real conversation so well said Melanie
