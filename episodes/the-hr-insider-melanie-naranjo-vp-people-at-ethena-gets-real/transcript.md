isolation I think there's a lot of um a
lot of bitterness happening and I have
 
lot of bitterness happening and I have
all the empathy in the world that I just

harder and harder and we don't have an
outlet to to sort of um talk about some
 
outlet to to sort of um talk about some

of the things that we're struggling with
but I also think and again I say this
 
but I also think and again I say this
with all the empathy in the world I also
 
with all the empathy in the world I also
think that sometimes because we are so
 
think that sometimes because we are so
siloed because we are so um uh desperate
 
siloed because we are so um uh desperate
uh we we sort of get in this cycle of
 
uh we we sort of get in this cycle of
autopilot and dwelling in what's not

what does it look and feel like what
does that mean so okay what I'll start
 
does that mean so okay what I'll start
with the your question uh Kelly so I
 
with the your question uh Kelly so I
think what it looks like is to be honest
 
think what it looks like is to be honest
I don't think that you always get the
 
I don't think that you always get the
best of us I think that sometimes we are
 
best of us I think that sometimes we are
half-assing it sometimes we are just
 
half-assing it sometimes we are just
doing the bare minimum mom to get by
 
doing the bare minimum mom to get by
because we are so burnt out we are so
 
because we are so burnt out we are so
exhausted and you know what the last
 
exhausted and you know what the last
time I put my heart and soul into a
 
time I put my heart and soul into a
project it got vetoed or I got buying to
 
project it got vetoed or I got buying to

this push back and never mind it's not
 
this push back and never mind it's not
going to happen go do something else
 
going to happen go do something else
right and so again like I I always
 
right and so again like I I always
approach with empathy I don't think
 
approach with empathy I don't think
anyone's doing it intentionally but I
 
anyone's doing it intentionally but I
think understandably after months years
 
think understandably after months years

of this kind of response it ends up
looking like I'm just not going to give
 
looking like I'm just not going to give
you my all anymore because I I
 
you my all anymore because I I
physically mentally cannot anymore now
 
physically mentally cannot anymore now
in terms of knowing your question I
 
in terms of knowing your question I
think you know I think we have to take a
 
think you know I think we have to take a
step back to really understand the full
 
step back to really understand the full
context here which is this is my opinion
 
context here which is this is my opinion
okay I think HR is a really unique
 
okay I think HR is a really unique
industry in that or or field in that up
 
industry in that or or field in that up
until I want to say the last few years I
 
until I want to say the last few years I
don't think most people sort of grew up
 
don't think most people sort of grew up
dreaming of being an HR I don't think HR
 
dreaming of being an HR I don't think HR
was sort of this you know uh this fancy
 
was sort of this you know uh this fancy
title that's what you want to be you
 
title that's what you want to be you
know your parents are pro you know
 
know your parents are pro you know
encouraging you to do this I think HR
 
encouraging you to do this I think HR
was a field and a function that people
 
was a field and a function that people
sort of fell into either because they
 
sort of fell into either because they
couldn't find something else they
 
couldn't find something else they
weren't sure what else they wanted to do
 
weren't sure what else they wanted to do
somebody saw some empathy in them and
 
somebody saw some empathy in them and
they were like clearly you must be in HR
 
they were like clearly you must be in HR
and for the record I put myself in this
 
and for the record I put myself in this
bucket I didn't dream of being in HR I
 
bucket I didn't dream of being in HR I
liter right I I literally could not get
 
liter right I I literally could not get
anything else I was like please somebody
 
anything else I was like please somebody
hire me and HR was the only one that was
 
hire me and HR was the only one that was
interested okay um and so I think you
 
interested okay um and so I think you
bring together a bunch of people who
 
bring together a bunch of people who
might not necessarily have been
 
might not necessarily have been
passionate about this thing and for the
 
passionate about this thing and for the
record I want to be fully cognizant and
 
record I want to be fully cognizant and
understanding of the fact that some
 
understanding of the fact that some
people did some people got their
 
people did some people got their
master's degrees for this right um but
 
master's degrees for this right um but
many people did not you just kind of
 
many people did not you just kind of
fell into it so I think you you put
 
fell into it so I think you you put
together a bunch of people who maybe
 
together a bunch of people who maybe
this wasn't even their dream to begin
 
this wasn't even their dream to begin
with then on top of that you don't
 
with then on top of that you don't
really Empower them so you say hey you
 
really Empower them so you say hey you
got a bunch of responsibility but no
 
got a bunch of responsibility but no
Authority your your Authority comes with
 
Authority your your Authority comes with
the power to influence that's your
 
the power to influence that's your
Authority and so then then right after
 
Authority and so then then right after
you give them this responsibility they
 
you give them this responsibility they
bring things to you they don't do it in
 
bring things to you they don't do it in
the right way say for example they just
 
the right way say for example they just
don't have business savvy so they think
 
don't have business savvy so they think
that an effective business case is
 
that an effective business case is
because the employees would really like
 
because the employees would really like
it I just I got the vibe they're really
 
it I just I got the vibe they're really
upset and I think this would make them
 
upset and I think this would make them
happy and then what happens the CEO
 
happy and then what happens the CEO
dismisses them because they're not
 
dismisses them because they're not
speaking the CEO's language they're
 
speaking the CEO's language they're
using terms like happiness they're using
 
using terms like happiness they're using
terms like it feels like the right thing
 
terms like it feels like the right thing
to do of course they're being dismissed
 
to do of course they're being dismissed
right but no one takes the time to give
 
right but no one takes the time to give
them that feedback explicitly and say
 
them that feedback explicitly and say

the case that our head of sales just
 
the case that our head of sales just

here because I think it could land
 
here because I think it could land
poorly and be received incorrectly is I
 
poorly and be received incorrectly is I
think that there is a gendered element
 
think that there is a gendered element
to this and what I mean by that is if
 
to this and what I mean by that is if
you look at the demographic of the HR
 
you look at the demographic of the HR
function the majority of us identify as
 
function the majority of us identify as
women um many of us identify as women of
 
women um many of us identify as women of

color and the reason that I say that I
think there can be a gendered element is
 
think there can be a gendered element is
if you look around a room of executive
 
if you look around a room of executive
right there might often times just be
 
right there might often times just be
one woman in that executive room and
 
one woman in that executive room and
it's the head of HR right and I think
 
it's the head of HR right and I think
often times what can happen is if
 
often times what can happen is if
someone is not presenting something in a
 
someone is not presenting something in a

intentional conversation about it and I
 
intentional conversation about it and I

it was because I'm a woman or because
 
it was because I'm a woman or because
I'm a woman of color but I can say that
 
I'm a woman of color but I can say that
there is very much a gender Dynamic when
 
there is very much a gender Dynamic when
you are the only woman in a senior room
 
you are the only woman in a senior room
and you say something and everyone just
 
and you say something and everyone just
looks at you like that was a dumb idea
 
looks at you like that was a dumb idea
but no one explains why right and so I
 
but no one explains why right and so I
think to go back to the point of like oh
 
think to go back to the point of like oh
you know we just get in this Silo of you
 
you know we just get in this Silo of you
know no one's listening to me you you
 
know no one's listening to me you you
just must be on the other side you don't
 
just must be on the other side you don't
get it I think I think it goes two ways

so I think that we do need to think
about power dynamics of all kinds when
 
about power dynamics of all kinds when

we are talking about um when we're
talking about HR and in relation to any
 
talking about HR and in relation to any

all you know it's just we're talking
we're not writing anything down and that
 
we're not writing anything down and that
has led to not only I think improvements
 
has led to not only I think improvements
in performance but it's also led to just
 
in performance but it's also led to just
awareness of how your colleagues are
 
awareness of how your colleagues are
feeling you're doing versus we get into

a tsunami when it happens and it's
 
a tsunami when it happens and it's
brutal couldn't agree more we were
 
brutal couldn't agree more we were
talking about this just before uh
 
talking about this just before uh
earlier today um in terms of so I firmly
 
earlier today um in terms of so I firmly
believe that people will fill in the
 
believe that people will fill in the
gaps and I think it's just human nature
 
gaps and I think it's just human nature
right we're trying to make sense of
 
right we're trying to make sense of
things we want to understand things and
 
things we want to understand things and
so if something is unspoken we will fill
 
so if something is unspoken we will fill
it in with our own assumptions and I
 
it in with our own assumptions and I
think it's perfectly understandable I'm
 
think it's perfectly understandable I'm
not saying it's right or the the right
 
not saying it's right or the the right
approach that people should take but I
 
approach that people should take but I
think it makes sense that you know if
 
think it makes sense that you know if
some if I present something and nobody
 
some if I present something and nobody
comments or or people just say like some
 
comments or or people just say like some
positive stuff but they don't have any
 
positive stuff but they don't have any
real conversations I'm going to fill in
 
real conversations I'm going to fill in
the gaps with okay either they don't
 
the gaps with okay either they don't
trust that I can take the feedback or
 
trust that I can take the feedback or
they weren't even listening or they you
 
they weren't even listening or they you
know they've all decided that I'm
 
know they've all decided that I'm
already bad at my job you know I'm going
 
already bad at my job you know I'm going
to fill in those gaps because no one is
 
to fill in those gaps because no one is
saying anything and so in the absence of
 
saying anything and so in the absence of
communication all these horrible
 
communication all these horrible
misunderstandings and assumptions get
 
misunderstandings and assumptions get
made and it it's wild and to your point
 
made and it it's wild and to your point
yeah it doesn't matter how senior you
 
yeah it doesn't matter how senior you
are we all do this it it continues to
 
are we all do this it it continues to
happen it never I have yet to see the
 
happen it never I have yet to see the
the most senior person I have yet to see
 
the most senior person I have yet to see
anyone who doesn't fall uh to
 
anyone who doesn't fall uh to
unfortunately these really poor habits
 
unfortunately these really poor habits
so I guess the question is how do you
 
so I guess the question is how do you
defend against it so we we kind of have
 
defend against it so we we kind of have
like a a ritual in which every six weeks
 
like a a ritual in which every six weeks
we do it most leadership teams don't
 
we do it most leadership teams don't
give feedback that regularly I think
 
give feedback that regularly I think
another thing you could potentially do
 
another thing you could potentially do
is just to ask for feedback from your
 
is just to ask for feedback from your
colleagues and I find that for again for
 
colleagues and I find that for again for
whatever reason you know potentially it
 
whatever reason you know potentially it
is like human ego which is very fragile
 
is like human ego which is very fragile
we're so scared to do it and to like put
 
we're so scared to do it and to like put
ourselves out there um I I think that is
 
ourselves out there um I I think that is
a way to potentially defend against not
 
a way to potentially defend against not
understanding how your colleagues are
 
understanding how your colleagues are
actually feeling about you versus
 
actually feeling about you versus
filling in gaps in with our own stories
 
filling in gaps in with our own stories
because we all tell ourselves stories
 
because we all tell ourselves stories
when we don't know I'm curious to get
 
when we don't know I'm curious to get
your take on that Melanie I think yes I
 
your take on that Melanie I think yes I
I you know I agree that we should be be
 
I you know I agree that we should be be
soliciting feedback and that is the
 
soliciting feedback and that is the
solution and also I think the problem is
 
solution and also I think the problem is
probably a little deeper than that I
 
probably a little deeper than that I
think that so many leadership teams are
 
think that so many leadership teams are
so entrenched in politics and working
 
so entrenched in politics and working
against each other instead of with each
 
against each other instead of with each
other that one I don't think most people
 
other that one I don't think most people
want to ask for their fellow exec's

I don't want to be vulnerable with you
 
I don't want to be vulnerable with you
right now I'm presenting you know a
 
right now I'm presenting you know a
tough front I think there are actually
 
tough front I think there are actually
some some teper issues that most
 
some some teper issues that most
leadership teams would probably need to
 
leadership teams would probably need to
work through before they even got to the
 
work through before they even got to the
point of being comfortable asking a
 
point of being comfortable asking a
question and I think it's it's beyond
 
question and I think it's it's beyond
ego in my opinion that's exactly what I
 
ego in my opinion that's exactly what I
was describing that this this like
 
was describing that this this like
politics gone bad situation and you know

you don't have that microchip or not
 
you don't have that microchip or not
have it in his case I don't know which
 
have it in his case I don't know which
one um how are you leaning on your your
 
one um how are you leaning on your your
HR leader someone that you trust to call
 
HR leader someone that you trust to call
your stuff out and make sure that it's
 
your stuff out and make sure that it's
healthy because once that room becomes
 
healthy because once that room becomes
unhealthy it all flows down from there I
 
unhealthy it all flows down from there I
I totally I that's exactly the question
 
I totally I that's exactly the question
I was going to ask which is when you
 
I was going to ask which is when you
don't have somebody like Todd who's the
 
don't have somebody like Todd who's the
the CEO I think what you're describing
 
the CEO I think what you're describing
Kelly by the way is an idea of
 
Kelly by the way is an idea of
meritocracy like to where it's just
 
meritocracy like to where it's just
about the ideas and the Merit of those
 
about the ideas and the Merit of those
ideas versus where they come from or who
 
ideas versus where they come from or who
said it that's that's that's where I
 
said it that's that's that's where I
think it gets really toxic is like oh
 
think it gets really toxic is like oh
only ideas from this person are okay
 
only ideas from this person are okay
versus like we evaluate all ideas on
 
versus like we evaluate all ideas on
their Merit when you don't have a Todd
 
their Merit when you don't have a Todd
as your CEO then how do you solve that
 
as your CEO then how do you solve that
problem in my mind it's basically just
 
problem in my mind it's basically just
like you have to try and terminate the
 
like you have to try and terminate the
person who's causing the toxicity or
 
person who's causing the toxicity or
leave am I missing something in that
 
leave am I missing something in that
logic well I would I would add that I
 
logic well I would I would add that I
don't actually think it's just about
 
don't actually think it's just about
being a meritocracy I think it's about
 
being a meritocracy I think it's about
having a clear and aligned Vision which
 
having a clear and aligned Vision which
I know sounds very frr but I mean very
 
I know sounds very frr but I mean very
specifically right I think most
 
specifically right I think most
companies there's a tendency to favor
 
companies there's a tendency to favor
one Department over another so the sales
 
one Department over another so the sales
team is the most important or the
 
team is the most important or the
engineering team is the most important
 
engineering team is the most important
right and and I think that that that
 
right and and I think that that that
then stir up these issues right like
 
then stir up these issues right like
yeah but how does this benefit the sales
 
yeah but how does this benefit the sales
team how is this ultimate do you know I
 
team how is this ultimate do you know I
mean as opposed to no no no we are
 
mean as opposed to no no no we are
united team and we have a company goal
 
united team and we have a company goal
how is any idea that we are presenting
 
how is any idea that we are presenting
ultimately helping the company because
 
ultimately helping the company because
if a sales leader comes in and they say
 
if a sales leader comes in and they say
we want to do X Y and Z but then the Cs
 
we want to do X Y and Z but then the Cs
team is going to fall apart because they
 
team is going to fall apart because they
can't support this thing that you are
 
can't support this thing that you are
asking them to do or the engineering
 
asking them to do or the engineering
team can't keep up with what it is that
 
team can't keep up with what it is that
you're asking them to produce then you
 
you're asking them to produce then you
have other problems start to fall to to
 
have other problems start to fall to to
come into play and things start to fall
 
come into play and things start to fall
apart I I think where it needs to start
 
apart I I think where it needs to start
is do we are we as a company aligned on
 
is do we are we as a company aligned on
what our singular goal is and how it is
 
what our singular goal is and how it is
that we get there and then any idea that
 
that we get there and then any idea that
gets brought to the table needs to needs
 
gets brought to the table needs to needs
to ultimately feed into that goal not
 
to ultimately feed into that goal not
not be pitting us against each other
 
not be pitting us against each other
right right and and you
 
right right and and you
know sometimes not but usually right if
 
know sometimes not but usually right if
you ask that founder CEO like what is
 
you ask that founder CEO like what is
this well they're not good they're not
 
this well they're not good they're not
performing well that that's fine and
 
performing well that that's fine and
that very well may be true but that's a
 
that very well may be true but that's a
different conversation and a different
 
different conversation and a different
how than what might be going on with
 
how than what might be going on with
this phenomenon that we're talking about
 
this phenomenon that we're talking about
of either ignoring them or avoiding them
 
of either ignoring them or avoiding them
right and it's just not it's just not a
 
right and it's just not it's just not a
good way of doing business because what
 
good way of doing business because what
does that do it actually impacts the
 
does that do it actually impacts the
business I mean you look at people feel
 
business I mean you look at people feel
like they've been treated wrongly right
 
like they've been treated wrongly right
now we have lawsuits now we have
 
now we have lawsuits now we have
wrongful terminations now we I mean it
 
wrongful terminations now we I mean it
just doesn't lead to good things all
 
just doesn't lead to good things all
around I I will say when there's a
 
around I I will say when there's a
performance issue it is important that
 
performance issue it is important that
you act really quickly as quickly as
 
you act really quickly as quickly as
possible and as transparently and
 
possible and as transparently and
directly as possible uh Adena we have so
 
directly as possible uh Adena we have so
we have these three questions that we
 
we have these three questions that we
have all managers ask themselves of
 
have all managers ask themselves of
their teams every I don't know like
 
their teams every I don't know like
let's say once a quarter periodically
 
let's say once a quarter periodically
but the idea is they know these in the
 
but the idea is they know these in the
back of their mind all the time um it's
 
back of their mind all the time um it's
is this person ultimately making my job
 
is this person ultimately making my job
easier or harder if I could go back in
 
easier or harder if I could go back in
time knowing what I know today would I
 
time knowing what I know today would I
hire them again and if they were to quit
 
hire them again and if they were to quit
today how would I feel panicked relieved
 
today how would I feel panicked relieved
neutral and the idea of that is to
 
neutral and the idea of that is to
remove the emotional element cuz often
 
remove the emotional element cuz often
times if you ask someone is someone a
 
times if you ask someone is someone a
high performer you get all these like
 
high performer you get all these like
hemming and ha like well well this
 
hemming and ha like well well this
they're really good at this but you know
 
they're really good at this but you know
they're really nice and well they
 
they're really nice and well they
they're good for morale like no no no no
 
they're good for morale like no no no no
no no I didn't hire them for morale I
 
no no I didn't hire them for morale I
hired them to get the job done so tell
 
hired them to get the job done so tell
me ultimately are they getting their job
 
me ultimately are they getting their job
done and so we found that these
 
done and so we found that these
questions are a really good starting
 
questions are a really good starting
point to sort of eliminate some of that
 
point to sort of eliminate some of that
emotion but but I will say I think the
 
emotion but but I will say I think the
most important thing is it helps you act
 
most important thing is it helps you act
quickly because you know I've seen some
 
quickly because you know I've seen some
real horror stor where you think you're
 
real horror stor where you think you're
doing someone a favor by dragging it out
 
doing someone a favor by dragging it out
by sugarcoating it and meanwhile this
 
by sugarcoating it and meanwhile this
person is miserable their morale is
 
person is miserable their morale is
being consistently beat down for months
 
being consistently beat down for months
sometimes I've seen it go on for years
 
sometimes I've seen it go on for years
where they're just being told like
 
where they're just being told like
constantly here's everything you did
 
constantly here's everything you did
wrong here's everything you did wrong
 
wrong here's everything you did wrong
but we're not explicitly saying you're
 
but we're not explicitly saying you're
not meeting expectations your job is on
 
not meeting expectations your job is on
the line if you're not if this isn't
 
the line if you're not if this isn't
turned around in two months you're not
 
turned around in two months you're not
going to be here anymore it doesn't help
 
going to be here anymore it doesn't help
anyone um and so yeah I will say when
 
anyone um and so yeah I will say when
those performance issues start to creep
 
those performance issues start to creep
up you just got to say it you got to rip
 
up you just got to say it you got to rip
off that band-aid and not just for the
 
off that band-aid and not just for the
not not just for that employee it's also
 
not not just for that employee it's also
for everyone else on the team who's
 
for everyone else on the team who's
having to carry their weight because
 
having to carry their weight because
they're not doing the work for the
 
they're not doing the work for the
manager who's having multiple endless
 
manager who's having multiple endless
conversations about this performance
 
conversations about this performance
issue when that manager could be doing
 
issue when that manager could be doing
so much else and for that employee who
 
so much else and for that employee who
quite frankly it could even be that this
 
quite frankly it could even be that this
is just not the right company for them
 
is just not the right company for them
and they would be thriving somewhere
 
and they would be thriving somewhere
else but you're not giving them that
 
else but you're not giving them that
opportunity because you're stringing
 
opportunity because you're stringing
them along there just so many problems
 
them along there just so many problems
that come into play when you're not
 
that come into play when you're not

best otherwise you can't stay here and
we're pretty we're pretty upfront and
 
we're pretty we're pretty upfront and
direct about this which I do think for
 
direct about this which I do think for
the record is very important some
 
the record is very important some
companies say this but then they don't
 
companies say this but then they don't
stand by it or they do it but then they
 
stand by it or they do it but then they
don't tell anyone in the interview
 
don't tell anyone in the interview
process and then the person thinks
 
process and then the person thinks
they're coming into a regular company
 
they're coming into a regular company
right Athena is the kind of company
 
right Athena is the kind of company
where you can't just be okay at your job
 
where you can't just be okay at your job
you have to be phenomenal you have to be
 
you have to be phenomenal you have to be
amazing you have to be the kind of
 
amazing you have to be the kind of
candidate that our peer companies would
 
candidate that our peer companies would
be fighting over right that's the deal
 
be fighting over right that's the deal
now what spurred this on is we realized
 
now what spurred this on is we realized
that unfortunately you know there were a
 
that unfortunately you know there were a
couple of months well I would say like
 
couple of months well I would say like
half a year to a year where we realized
 
half a year to a year where we realized
we didn't think that we were actually
 
we didn't think that we were actually
holding up our end of the bargain we
 
holding up our end of the bargain we
didn't actually think that we were
 
didn't actually think that we were
holding people accountable we thought we
 
holding people accountable we thought we
were because we have a feedback heavy
 
were because we have a feedback heavy
culture every other Friday we require
 
culture every other Friday we require
managers and direct reports to meet and
 
managers and direct reports to meet and
give each other feedback and they were
 
give each other feedback and they were
giving each other feedback but we
 
giving each other feedback but we
realized that everyone was being just a
 
realized that everyone was being just a
little bit too lenient right you're
 
little bit too lenient right you're
really nice person I can tell that
 
really nice person I can tell that
they're trying but we weren't actually
 
they're trying but we weren't actually
doing the thing and so so really what we
 
doing the thing and so so really what we
we we realized was this was having a
 
we we realized was this was having a
ripple effect right people were upset
 
ripple effect right people were upset
people were complaining our actual High
 
people were complaining our actual High
performers were doing less their their
 
performers were doing less their their
work was impacted because they were
 
work was impacted because they were
upset they were tired of doing twice the
 
upset they were tired of doing twice the
work because the other person on team
 
work because the other person on team
wasn't doing their job and so you know
 
wasn't doing their job and so you know
in in full transparency this came out
 
in in full transparency this came out
because we weren't doing what we said we
 
because we weren't doing what we said we
were going to do and so we really wrote
 
were going to do and so we really wrote
this to sort of like commit to it
 
this to sort of like commit to it
publicly but also um it it was something
 
publicly but also um it it was something
that we wanted to put out there to our
 
that we wanted to put out there to our
employees and so after we did that we
 
employees and so after we did that we
put it out to the rest of the world as
 
put it out to the rest of the world as
well and it's a resetting of
 
well and it's a resetting of
expectations for everybody internally
 
expectations for everybody internally
and it serves as a magnet and deterrent
 
and it serves as a magnet and deterrent
for all candidates externally yes which
 
for all candidates externally yes which
I think is important I think oftentimes
 
I think is important I think oftentimes
people think that uh the interview
 
people think that uh the interview
process is just about selling and it is
 
process is just about selling and it is
a little bit about selling but it's also
 
a little bit about selling but it's also
about making sure that you're scaring
 
about making sure that you're scaring
away people who wouldn't do well at your
 
away people who wouldn't do well at your
company because quite frankly I would
 
company because quite frankly I would
rather that you walk away from this
 
rather that you walk away from this
process now than walking away three
 
process now than walking away three
months in because you realize this isn't
 
months in because you realize this isn't
what you thought you signed up for so
 
what you thought you signed up for so

then I guess clicking in as it relates
to low performance at Athena do you guys
 
to low performance at Athena do you guys
do Pips do you guys believe in Pips or
 
do Pips do you guys believe in Pips or
or do you try and avoid the PIP process

tends to be so controversial people feel
 
tends to be so controversial people feel
really strongly about this we don't do
 
really strongly about this we don't do
Pips we don't do Pips and I think
 
Pips we don't do Pips and I think
personally my opinion is that most
 
personally my opinion is that most
people do Pips for liability reasons
 
people do Pips for liability reasons
they just want to have a thing kind of
 
they just want to have a thing kind of
documented right but I think that Pips
 
documented right but I think that Pips
oftentimes can just be an excuse for I
 
oftentimes can just be an excuse for I
haven't been giving you feedback for a
 
haven't been giving you feedback for a
really long time so now retroactively
 
really long time so now retroactively
I'm going to put it all out there um I

also think Pips are incredibly
 
also think Pips are incredibly
demoralizing it's sort of like hey for
