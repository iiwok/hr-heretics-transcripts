# Blitzscaling LinkedIn, Competitive Exec Teams, and RTO with Steve Cadigan

## Transcript

 
most people know more about what they
don't want from HR than what they do
want and you go in in the interview and
you say what does great HR look like to
you and they said well it's not this and
it's definitely not that Jeff weiner is
a legendary CEO and I have heard he can
be a total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what was it like
working with Jeff he was looking to trap
me in the interview I just I it was one
of those weird interviews where I'm like
you don't really like HR you've never
seen it and he had this real aversion to
talking about culture right I mean he
literally told me in the interview you
are not going to be my conary that is
not what I want here if I take a look at
HR in general you are serving two things
primarily at the end of the day judgment
and credibility those are your products
and the best way to realize whether your
judgment matters and whether you have
credibility is to deal with gnarly stuff

hey everybody welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast where we get into the
real talk of company construction these
are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and board members behind closed doors
we're Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially
with people but on the show we tell the
truth and expect the same from our
guests today we have Steve kigan on the
show Steve was the chro at LinkedIn from
 
Steve Nolan I mean he he was just really
vulnerable I mean he was super human he
was super humble and he's done it all I
mean EA to LinkedIn and onward the
stories he told were real and it was so
fun to listen to I think the audience is
going to love Steve story specifically
around Jeff Weiner and the culture of
intensity and how Steve ended up not
only just surviving but thriving in that
type cure totally I loved how he said
you literally couldn't pay him enough to
go back and do an operator role and his
stories around why I mean he's seen both
sides it was just it was really cool to
talk to him about it yeah I mean Steve
is a total ass kicker is the way I would
describe him to the audience and and you
will get that as you listen to this
episode and I love his takes on EX
Executives on how you transition out of
Executives on like betting on people but
the risks associated with that also like
bringing in people who have like really
scaled experience and the risk
associated with that and to your point
Kelly he was so humble in how many
mistakes that he made it just made
leadership more human to me and I think
the audience is going to learn a lot
stay tuned after the interview for our
weekly segment where we hit on hate
speech at work after recent incidents at
Apple and wix
so without further Ado here's Steve
Steve welcome to the show we're so
excited to have you so great to be here
I'm looking forward to this our goal
really with this show is to get into the
stuff that people are really scared to
talk about um there's I think
conventional wisdom in HR is to be
really fluffy to not say anything like
controversial and so what we've been
hearing from our listeners so far as it
relates to feedback is they want to hear
you get into like the meaty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of what
you've seen in your career the stuff
that you haven't talked about and the
stuff that other people aren't talking
about publicly I I think I built a
career I believe that uh I broke more
policies than I made and um
non-traditional you know and I think
that's the theme with Colleen and and
Patty and so you know that's more fun to
me solving problems than being HR and uh
it's such a weird weird profession from
the the standpoint of it's highly
relationship based there is no
accreditation um many many people were
deputized because they were the admin of
the CEO and they got into it more I
didn't want to get into HR because I I
saw more people that I didn't like doing
HR than I did so I was really reluctant
to be in the field you know so I think
the the best uh HR leaders that I've
come across are the ones like yeah I'm
not really HR you know but uh here I am
and it's just also Complicated by the
fact that most people know more about
what they don't want from HR than what
they do want you know and you go in in
the interview and you say what is great
HR look like to you and they said well
it's not this and it's definitely not
that and like so you haven't seen it you
know and that's sort of on us you know
and uh I think Colleen said it HR is
such an easy target for poor leadership
that we take the hit a lot of times uh
unfairly that's a great place to start
and then like taking that into just how
that crystallized for you through your
early companies through EA up and
through Linkedin we have a stories on
the LinkedIn scale I love some of the
stuff in your your book uh Steve right
the concepts around the anxiety ridden
workplace and economy things like that
um were very interesting to me and then
you have some really great points of
view on remote work that we really
haven't touched in depth noan we haven't
at all all right I want to jump into
LinkedIn so you were at LinkedIn from
 
the interesting thing for me about
LinkedIn is it wasn't considered sexy
like Google and Facebook back in the day
but it actually was known for having an
amazing culture and then ultimately had
a massive exit to
Microsoft how did you guys do it like
give us the details on those
stories yeah so let me go back a little
bit um going into LinkedIn I'd never
worked in that Siz company before I was
a big company Refugee every one of our
executives
uh probably came to the table saying we
know more about how we shouldn't and
don't want to you know build a company
than we do and the CEO was the firsttime
CEO uh no one had ever been in this
product space before uh recruiting and
recruiting product and so forth and so
it was a real adventure and
experimentation exercise on a massive
scale and for me walking in the door I
thought well how hard can this be to
build a company I mean I've seen every
mistake I've made tons of mistakes over
the course of my care career how hard is
this going to be and what I didn't
appreciate was I'd never built a company
before and taking HR down to the studs
and having nothing like literally week
one there was a huge fight in the
executive meeting around performance
reviews should we do it should we not do
it if we do it should we have a
three-point scale fivepoint scale seveno
scale and if it's a seveno scale should
it be seven points and seven decimal
places and if we give a rating should we
tell the employees or should we not tell
the employees and what's the rhythm of
that quarterly Bally you know every six
months annually whatever you want to do
and then should we also do rating and
ranking and I'm like are you kidding me
you guys have been around 5 six years
you got 400 people you've not even
thought about this and they'd been
holding on till you know the adult
supervision HR person and I was the
first HR full-time person on staff that
they'd ever had and uh and so couple
that with the fact that everyone on that
leadership team was suspicious of HR you
know I even Jeff we
he was first- time CEO I was the first
hire that he made on his staff he
inherited everyone
else and he looked at he was looking to
trap me in the interview I just I it was
one of those weird interviews where I'm
like you don't really like HR you've
never seen it and he had this real
aversion to talking about culture right
I mean he literally told me in the
interview you are not going to be my
conary that is not what I want here and
I'm thinking I didn't propose that I
would be your consiliary like I don't
know what you're talking about so I left
that interview going wow man I don't
know if I want to work with this guy and
they're really down on HR and it's a
Miss because they're main customer my
peers right so um but back to your
question Nolan I mean gosh I can't tell
you uh what a great opportunity it was
on one level to be do practicing HR in a
company whose main product is HR whose
main customer is HR and so I got to do
product um you know feedback I got to do
sales calls and I got to practice my
credit which was a dream come true on so
many levels but here was the irony you
ready for this one our biggest problem
as a company was recruiting people and
our biggest product was selling
recruiting and if our customers knew at
that point we had no idea why we weren't
more effective um I think it really
would have harmed us and so we were
struggling so bad the first two two and
a half three years I was there um and
finally we uh we had this moment of
truth if you will sat around as a a
leadership team and uh you know I was
saying listen every one we're competing
against is uh got a bigger budget than
us they got bigger salaries better
benefits better when we used to work in
buildings I don't know if the listeners
remember that but we used to work in
buildings and I mean our neighbor we
were surrounded by Google and their
daycare centers and their Sushi chefs
and their fancy buses we had to go over
new higher orientation how to avoid
getting hit by the Google buts is
walking to the buildings and so and then
Netflix comes in and says uh we're just
going to give you a number like 400,000
and then you say what what you want in
stock and you say what you want in bonus
and vacation and we're like what we you
know our whole package is 400 but
there's this bonus and if you do good
and the customer likes us and you know
the accelerators come in so it was
really really hard and so finally we
have a moment of truth as an executive
team where I sit around and say guys we
really got nothing here so you got to
give me something you either give give
me more budget or you give me some kind
of you know reason for us to give
candidates of why they should choose us
because they're not and our decline rate
was off the chart scary I mean something
like 40% offer acceptance rate so um
that was a Moment of Truth where we
finally asked a question which every
company should ask and I and you know 30
I was going into this I know something
like 25 years in HR 30 years in HR I
never asked this question which is so
Elemental but so profound why would any
one want to work here and the reason we
never ask the question is we just assume
cuz we're nice people are number one you
know we're great we're going to make
good money we got a good leadership team
and we got good investors and the
future's bright and we have beer Fridays
and all that and what a candidate hears
when you say that is blah blah blah blah
blah because everyone says that and then
they do listen to the Beer part but
that's about it and so I'm asking the
team like what do we got we have no
beautiful vacation we have no beautiful
buildings we have no technology luminary
on staff and and so it forced us to
really look at ourselves in the mirror
and say okay what do we have we have a
problem we're solving helping people
find their dream jobs no one can touch
that that is really beautiful it's
better than selling DVDs it's better
than helping kids develop their short
attention span capability over there at
face plan I mean Facebook and it's
better than you know proliferating fake
news or being engineer number 7,000 over
a Google and buffing the trophies of
everyone before you I don't know what do
you want to do you want to help people
find their dream job or do you want to
go over there and be assigned you know
some random project that you don't have
any input into it's up to you and we
started re I mean we started turning the
tide and then here's the the the moment
that really changed uh and if you have
the opportunity to do this as a company
I would highly recommend that you really
leverage it which was we said what asset
do we have you know so why would you
want to work here okay answer problem
we're solving second thing is what
assets do we have to really
differentiate oursel in a very you know
Candy Store career you know Silicon
Valley like it's a career candy store
and we said well we can't pay people
more we don't have all these things but
we can make working here the most
learning Rich experience of your
lifetime and then someone said it wasn't
me someone said and by the way we're the
Professional Network shouldn't we be the
best place for professionals you know
and it sounds so obvious in retrospect
like yeah we should own that we are the
Professional Network it should be the
greatest place any professional's ever
been and so we didn't agree on much as a
leadership team I mean this was not a
LinkedIn leadership team was not a hey
let's go hang out and have barbecues it
wasn't it was like you know very
competitive very intense uh mirroring
the personality of our CEO Jeff and so
you know we we were sort of all in on
this is going to be the greatest job you
ever had we can't pay you more we
believe if the company performs there's
going to be a great Destiny for lots of
us financially but this problems we're
solving and we're going to create
something great all that amongst Jeff
starting off with I really think culture
is a trap those posters on the wall
that's a trap that the employees are
going to call me out on and he'd seen at
Yahoo all this talk about culture and
all the executives doing the other thing
so what helped us turn the corner was
recognizing who we were it was kind of
like organizational puberty right like
all of a sudden oh okay that's who we
are okay we got to be a great
Professional Network okay yes it's our
birth right we should own that uh the
problem worth solving let's you know
really articulate that well and if we
don't have any Tech luminaries here
let's start bringing them in for lunch
and learns and so forth and that really
started to turn turn The Tide and I I
would say my first two years there I bet
not a single person came in without a
pay cut not one yeah and so that was
really helpful it's so interesting that
we like take our experience before like
you said about Jeff and Yahoo and I was
at Yahoo too at the time Jeff was and I
I get it I get taking those experiences
and imprint on you you're like I'm never
going to do that again or I'm going to
do that over and over um it's something
that that I find very fascinating Steve
you said something that I thought I've
felt in my own career and I think a lot
of folks may be on the line are feeling
maybe they're the founders are the one
the ones that are imprinting this on
them but you said you know I got there
and they didn't like HR they you know
it's it's usually especially in these
early stage um companies that are
growing from the outset Nolan you might
have a point of view as well it's kind
of like this necessary evil that we know
we have to have but we don't really want
steering the ship or taking it in a way
that we don't want to take it and I I i'
I've been through that and it's like
this double whammy of clawing for trust
in a place at that at that table and
also trying to put in what they see is
Right boring foundations that aren't
about product that aren't about sales
that aren't about Revenue but they're
necessary and I don't know about you but
there's been times where it finally
clicked like those moments that you
finally get over that hump and it's it's
almost unfair how difficult that is to
do but can you unpack like when that
moment for you happened at LinkedIn and
how that worked maybe some advice on how
to get there because it's certainly a
big hump to get over yeah it is and I
think everyone you know I knew in the
interview process okay these people
don't know what HR can do so one of the
founders the head of engineering said
his main focus of my interview was what
do I think of 401k
plants I was like impressed that he knew
what a 401k plan was so like okay um
someone was like you know do you are you
ready to make a sacrifice you're not
going to see your kids I was the only
executive that had three young kids um
at LinkedIn all the other ones had
either no kids or grown kids or Jeff had
young kids but 20 nannies so it does
count um so um you know so for me if I
take a look at HR and general you are
serving two things primarily at the end
of the day judgement jent and
credibility those are your products okay
and the best way to realize whether your
judgment matters and whether you have
credibility is to deal with gnarly stuff
quickly okay so I'm always looking for
that that's why I love m&amp;a because
you're going to have tons of problems
and tons of impossible situations and
people are going to see What You're Made
Of so the first thing in any
organization is every executive's asking
can I trust you and they're going to set
you they're going to put you in
situations where they're going to tell
you something and they're going to see
if you're going to run the CEO or the
CFO or what you're going to do okay and
so I was really looking forward to those
moments so for example in the
performance review discussion they were
so ready to hear me say oh we have to
have performance reviews like hey I hate
performance reviews and they're like
what I said oh yeah I hate it I said can
you tell me the moment in your career
that changed your life was that great
performance review that you had I like
this has any executive ever said that
pivotal moment was that great
performance review I got no it's
deflating it's a horror show that you're
asking your leaders to go through and
most people especially in Silicon Valley
have never been trained on how to
deliver this really really well so I'm
like yeah I'm all in let's not do it and
they're like what no we have to do it
and then I had them I totally had him
I'm like no no we have to why do you
have to do it well because we need you
know to make sure that we're realizing
high performance I go but do we need a
performance review for that so right
away I'm laying it down like no I'm not
coming from some policy Playbook that
they're expecting me to implement to
deflate their you know Ambitions to
build a great company so that's when
they're that you know I put them in the
position of coming to Lobby me for
infrastructure versus me hammering you
know with my policy Bible under my arm
second day on the job CEO's assistant's
father passes away she comes in hey
what's our bereavement policy I look
left I look right I see not a policy
manual in my office I go hm direct
family member I said How's three days
she goes great okay done first policy
done and she's like wow he was so cool
you know how he did that so all those
sequences you know start building and
for whatever reason whether it's cuz my
dad was a minister and I watch him give
sermons my my whole life but I have
built a capacity to help people explain
what they're feeling in better ways that
they're capable of doing so if you bring
me an issue I'm able to replay it to you
in a way that seems manageable and not
so scary and not pack with emotion so
and we had our fair share I mean gosh
when you say 400 to 4,000 that's not the
hard part the hard part was two
countries to 17 and three offices to 26
offices in three years just like what
like I'm lucky I still have hair and I
still have a neck that can rotate you
look great you look great we'll be right

comom I love that our two products are
judgment and credibility I I could not
agree more in doing this for almost 24
years and just the work and and that
that really is it and I get I get highes
a lot of times and they're like well
what's your what are the metrics and the
business and the metrics and the metrics
and metric and it's like uh necessary
but not sufficient and we usually do not
lead with what I think is the middle
Weare the gray matter all the things
that
that make these teams this organization
work from behind the scenes that can
usually be distilled down to judgment
credibility people and you're helping to
facilitate that in ways that Founders
might not even realize how do you maybe
you don't combat it but how do you how
do you answer that question while what
what are the metrics that's all great
judgment credibility but what what do
you do here what what do you create well
I I think you you know what uh what I
love about this conversation and
listening to the conversation you had
with Patty MC
I'll rephrase what Patty said which is
if you're doing HR really well you are
working yourself out of a job you are
making other people better and the
reason I almost didn't come into HR is
because I saw so many HR leaders that
I'd work for early in my career building
dependencies on themselves out of
insecurity and we all know the worst
combination is power and insecurity and
a boss who has no children like that is
the worst combo ever right or in HR
someone who used to be a labor lawyer
then then it's like you know quadruple
whammy cuz everything's viewed through
the lens of this could blow up and you
know let's double down and protect
ourselves right so I you know I think
the way I think about this is um you
know we have a really hard impossible
task which is compliance and
construction and if I'm the person
coming in saying here's your development
plan and I'm going to make you a great
executive and next day it's knock knock
we've had a sexual harassing complaint
about you and I got to investigate it I
mean that's just like an impossible way
for me to build trust and confidence
when you know I've got this compliance
monster that I got to adhere to which is
you know necessary but I also have this
constructive notion so you know I I
think you have to find your Rhythm right
and this is the thing that I think uh a
lot of HR people may not appreciate and
let's just take a moment to give
ourselves a hug like the if you look at
the full domain of you know let's take
you know sourcing recruiting onboarding
training compensation immigration
relocation labor law
diversity uh you know now we've got all
kinds of like HR Analytics and we've got
AI coming into you know to the scene to
you know and then we've got all kinds of
systems that the CFO bought that we had
no input on that we've got to leverage
and um it's really complex and if you're
really good in HR you're probably
excellent at two of those disciplines
and that's just the job inside the
company like all the stuff outside with
the world I mean let's just tack that on
to the to the Sunday so you're excellent
at two you're okay at like 3 or 4 you
can talk your way around another two and
then you got to surround yourself with
people who are going to cover all the
other places right everyone's portfolio
is different so my suggestion is
whenever you're looking at an
organization as an HR you know potential
HR leader in any role look at the
leadership team where they worked before
and that'll tell you a lot of what their
expectations are you know if I had
someone from prior to SAA over at
Microsoft I had someone from Microsoft
they are really political I knew it was
a really rough environment if someone
was from Google they were used to seeing
you know somewhat of a progressive you
know HR practice if there was ex Yahoo
like I want to know the pedigree uh cuz
there you know it's been a while since
I've practicing actively about 10 years
since I left LinkedIn but that's always
important you know because that pedigree
is going to inform what their
expectations are right around human
resources and if you can kind of get a
sense for that you don't have to start
from zero when you go into an
organization you can start with sort of
you know where they're probably thinking
about the function Steve what's your
take on HR people you're coming at this
from a completely lens than what I hear
generally from HR folks you're coming at
this from a business lens and a problem
first lens and first principles lens I
typically hear from HR people like we
actually should Implement performance
reviews right away if we don't have them
because we are concerned about
compliance what's your take on those
folks yeah I don't think compliance is
the goal I think high performance is the
goal and Performance Management is
something that could contribute to that
um um where we ultimately got to in in
implementing performance reviews is
because the CEO Jeff says I hate these
things I don't want to do them I said
okay well then you go tell the board
we're not going to do performance
reviews because you don't want to do it
and I'm not doing it and the biggest
reason performance reviews don't stick
is because of no executive buying so I'm
not even GNA waste my time so you go do
it so he's not ready to do that he's
like oh okay we better we better do it
so I'm like okay um and I say that with
with reverence and respect right like he
was the first time CEO he he didn't know
and he'd been more burned probably by
that than others so you know there's a
couple of for me there's real benchmarks
for someone in the HR evolution of
growth one is you know I always like to
ask people where are you in your
philosophy of HR do you have one like
why is HR here okay because that'll tell
you a lot about where they are and their
growth like what is our function what is
our purpose why are we here and if I
hear something like um oh yeah we you
know make employees
happy nope not here here to make them
happy we're here to win and just so
happy it just so happens happy employees
tend to win more but the goal is not
happy their goal is winning and if we
make happy and objective we're disabling
hard conversations we're disabling
confrontation we're disabling the
storming forming norming you know the
Natural Evolution of team so let's you
know recognize that not to disable
happiness but the goal is winning and
that means we need to help people have
hard conversations that's why
performance reviews are necessary
because we need to build that muscle of
people being honest and having
conversations but I also subscribe to
the Marcus Buckingham school which is
let's talk about strengths more than
weaknesses and if someone's you know not
not good at this and they may never be
good at it but they're really good at
these things so let's design their job
to more double down on those things um
so I mean having like I told you I had
the great opportunity to build HR from
nothing and to question everything you
know how many levels
uh what's the compensation philosophy
how do we want to do all that stuff and
when you do that it really forces you to
to Really you know address things that
you took for granted earlier in your
career right and uh and so what what we
finally got up to when I left and we
went through four different iterations
but it was quarterly
conversations you know not a review
Steve um I love your your whole Aura
around HR your style your your
directness I probably wanted I Pro I'm
Discerning that you're not the easiest
guy to work for right if I'm a new HR
leader and I'm coming in and I've got my
best practices book and all my stuff
like how did you make more of you how
did you push them I'm sure it wasn't
always comfortable but what is your
philosophy on teaching and literally
building great HR leaders because I
don't think we have enough of them with
your makeup I would go so far as to say
today yeah I I mean I don't you have to
ask the people that work for me how how
much of a nightmare I was was and I
think gosh in LinkedIn I made a ton of
mistake I mean it was new and I I made a
lot of mistakes if I were to go do it
again which I never will but at 4 years
felt like 20 but um I think that what I
tried to do was really make time value
their success ask them in the interview
process where do you want to go in your
career and how can I help you get there
I mean that's that's what was refreshing
listening to your conversation with
Patty like we got to the point in
Silicon Valley where you know I don't
know what the median tenure is right now
but it's somewhere around you know a
year to 18 months probably and for
engineers probably a little bit less so
we began our interviews with hey when
you leave LinkedIn what do you want to
be doing and people be like what we're
talking about my exit I haven't have you
given me a job offer yet like what's
going on and we we just said let's have
an honest conversation like we know
you're probably not going to stay and
that's fine but let's make this the best
part of your journey right so how can we
do that and so I Tred to do that with my
team uh I try to be pretty clear on what
my expectations are and also try to be
supportive of them like what's the
biggest thing blocking you and how can I
untangle that right and we we were
really when you're growing like we were
at LinkedIn it is really hard because
the company's changing every day and
every Department's got to build
different and better processes to try to
support the growth and then we had you
know my biggest regret for that whole
time that I was there and there was a
ton of them this is probably the top of
the list was we would start every year
with the planning cycle and Jeff was so
anti-big company which I loved but we
would start the year with a headcount
plan of like 200 and by the end of the
year it was like 800 I'm like when you
don't plan we don't have the resources
to recruit when we don't have the
resources you and your managers are
kicking my team in the face because you
didn't plan right and so I didn't
probably get clarity on that until like
four years later after the PTSD started
to wear off like wait a second why were
we the bad like you guys didn't ever
tell you didn't never accurately
forecast anywhere close to what we were
doing right and and then nobody at the
time and this it's hard to Fathom right
now at the time we were growing this is
 
other hypergrowth you know Farm or
factory we were all doing at the same
time VMware and Google and all the
Google Founders were you know hard to
reach on their islands and their yacht
so they wer didn't want to come work for
us so we had to figure out our own way
and that's really hard I mean really
hard Jeff Jeff weiner is a legendary CEO
and I have heard he can be a total
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what was it like working with
Jeff it was really intense I'll give you
a great story I learned so much from
Jeff um you know he's the classic CEO
where he like hey there's a brick wall I
like no there's not I see a hole right
over there you're going to go right
through it and so many assumptions I had
about HR Jeff would question and most of
the time he was right you know like no
we can do it I was like oh you're what
you're saying is you're willing to look
past the ramifications and say we're
just going to do it I was like I would
never do that it's like okay we'll do it
so one day I walk into Jeff's office off
us and um something really bad had
happened we've been hacked by some
hackers and they stole passwords like
millions of them and this was a PR
Nightmare and Jeff was as calm as I've
ever seen him I'm like you know we all
thought you were going to go nuts you
know and start you know taking the a
verbal you know ak-15 at people you know
and taking people no not at all he was
calling me say Steve you need to
understand something about me and I'm
grateful this was early earlier in our
relationship he said I live off of
intensity and if people aren't as
intense as I am in the moment I'm going
to create a situation that's going to
make them
intense and so I'm like whoa so this
moment is really intense and you're just
right in your element it's like this is
it and he's like yep and so that was a
you know a really that was a great um
learning experience for me like don't go
in there and he Jeff would never want to
just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shat it's like and he's got a
lot to give and he's really intense
student really really smart so uh so
that was you know clue number one about
who Jeff was the second uh great story
about Jeff is we would have as an
executive team um employee surveys every
six months and everyone every manager
would get the results like do you
inspire people is your team clear in
their goals you know sort of the gall of
 
bit and on the executive team we would
share as a group what our scores were
what our team thought of us including
Jeff who whose results were the of us in
the room like 12 of us and every year
for like two and a half years Jeff got
the lowest score Among Us of do you
inspire your team okay and it was
killing him now was it a bad score on a
scale of one being low and five being
high it was like a 4.2 it was a good
score but it was less than all of ours
okay so he pulls me in the office one
day he's like hey for the last year I
see this bulletin board right next to me
he's like it's been my number number one
priority to inspire people you know I'm
just I'm at my wits in like what what do
you think I can do and I said Jeff let
me ask you a question and this was one
of those moments my hair is still Rising
on my arm just remembering the story
because it was just so I was very proud
of this moment I said Jeff when you meet
with your team where do you meet with
them he goes right here in this office I
said okay when you're meeting with them
what's usually the issue something going
well or something broken he goes oh my
job is to and he's stopped right there
and he realized that office was a place
where bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was getting discussed and
uncomfortable stuff and he's like oh
okay and from that day forward most of
his one-on ones were walking around
outside in the building it was never
there and those of who are listening to
this conversation you know and I I use
that to explain one of my fears about
this more remote world of work which is
um you know in a remote world of work
most of our interactions are scheduled
they're not informal or or they're not
together in a you know unplanned way
when you're with your child and you say
we need to have a talk and you sit down
the Walls come up when you're driving
them to school and there's no agenda and
you're both looking forward and there's
no eye contact at each other that's when
the real stuff comes out and so Jeff
became a master and and the the part
that I loved about working with him is
he learned so fast like didn't even have
to get through and the second part of
that story that of the hacking incident
in Jeff's I I believe in his growth as a
leader was he got in front of the
company and took full ownership for that
he's like I'm going to fix this this is
on me and he was terrified he's like
Steve it's really uncomfortable for me
he became vulnerable for the first time
and guess what happened he got back to
his office and his email had never been
more filled with employees going oh my
God I love you you're the best and he
saw oh being vulnerable was really a
superpower that he'd never tested before
right and that was really cool yeah I
talk to a lot of HR leaders around
because they a lot focus on the data and
the programs and going in with right a
point of view and solving over the the
the Achilles heel is the employees and
the feedback and it's it's one thing
that you can't really disprove with data
or a product or this or that it's what
do people think of you and whether you
or not this is it and I don't you say
that in a way to weaponize it it was it
always opened the door for a very
authentic and vulnerable conversation
which then opened up different doors and
you know running around using that again
as a weapon and all the time is not the
right thing but if you can package that
in a way it's very P very powerful it is
powerful and those of the listeners who
are HR leaders who may be struggling for
you know for whatever reason
uh that's our destiny to be struggling I
guess all the time I got some I got some
advice for you you don't own the you
don't own HR your leadership team does
your job is to get them to own it so I
you know you want to make sure something
doesn't work in a company make it an HR
program that's like destined for failure
don't get your leadership team to
Advocate it get in front of them help
them support them coach them um and this
was probably the biggest fight Jeff and
I had in the early days he like you own
the compensation strategy oh you want me
to own how we all get paid you're good
you're going to sign off on it oh yeah
he goes to you know our CFO he owns the
finance our legal she owns that I was
like no no you own it I said I'll help
you I'll architect it I'll propose it to
you but you as a leadership team you got
to own this is our company you don't
want to you don't want me to
bureaucratize some sort of system that
you guys don't like like let's do this
together and I think that's where some
of the insecurities of people who feel
like I need to have my fif D in HR we
need to operate in a black box that's
just a failed strategy you know and you
got to make other people better and show
them the challenges that you're you're
you're facing and help them realize why
you being The Devil's Advocate sometimes
is uncomfortable but it's necessary uh
and if you do it with respect and
reverence I think they'll appreciate it
you know even more to the point where
they'll start coming to you and saying
what do you think of this in advance
which is I think Patty told a really
great story how you know you're right
more than you're wrong and so you know
credibility and judgment what I like to
say about those two is if you don't have
good judgment will not be credible and
if you're not credible no one cares
about your judgment so you look for
those problems to show your measure and
really try to you know help you know see
those really hard gnarly things as
opportunities for people to see your
creativity in that Steve one of the
bigger mistakes I made earlier in my
career was trying to own culture trying
to own comp trying to be the person that
owned everything and you're right that
was a failed strategy how did you
actually convince Jeff and the rest of
the leadership team that they were the
owners of that I had a few
um uh advantages uh number one I had a
sales leader Mike gson who was more in
front of me on culture than anyone I'd
ever met in my life now I don't know
about you but the sales leaders is
usually the person you're like I'm
watching you that offsite in Vegas no
you're not they always choose
Vegas I know I almost started uh like a
short book for us saying you know it's
called HR trans like when you say this
HR hears this when you say we're having
a sales conference in Vegas HR hears
I'll be firing someone on Monday you
know like or if you say our comp ranges
aren't high enough you're telling me
really you have no ability to sell the
company on anything but money you know
how did you convince Jeff and the
leadership team that they were the
owners of culture they were the owners
of comp and you were just the
facilitator right okay so I number one I
had Mike gamson who was a head of sales
who really his patch was almost all of
our field operations so that was a huge
safety valve I had and a leader in that
he wasn't he didn't have a sales kickoff
meeting talking about the number or your
quota it was about our values right and
so that was amazing and we used to have
sales people we'd hire from Salesforce
like what what when are we going to get
to the number you you'd be like no Rel
relationships matter trust and integrity
honesty these things and so that was
that was really really valuable and then
we really had a debate culture on the
leadership team where we really
you know tried to hammer it out and I
think most of my execs we had probably
 
majority some some Adobe and some
scattering like me from Cisco and other
places you know we we said you there was
a general like yeah let's do it
differently you know let's try to let's
try to build this a little bit
differently and they really took for
whatever reason I was dealt a hand where
like people really wanted to own their
stuff you know and they really felt the
passion so my job was to try to come
with something somewhat consistent right
the biggest difference was how sales
wanted to use stock and how product and
Engineering wanted to use stock and the
fight was most companies give a little
bit more to your engineering and then
the next level is GNA and then the
lowest level is sales in terms of equity
um substance because sales is more cash
oriented right and so when it became
pretty clear that the value of those
shares was going to be a whole heck of a
lot that became a bit of a challenge but
that consistency of like we would debate
stuff and work it out rather than me in
some black box and I think I I had a
hand in not not making decisions in the
early days sort of like putting it out
there for the team to decide and Jeff
Jeff's just wired that way he's like no
no no HR is not going to do this we're
going to do this as a leadership team so
I'll give him the the blessing on that
the second thing is I've never I've
always worked for a company that said
people are number one I never had worked
for a company until LinkedIn where where
the operating priorities were people
first so it's usually when you'd have a
company meeting it's like okay here's
our you know deliverables as a company
you know engineering sales operations
here's what we're doing here's the m&amp;a
landscape blah blah blah we would begin
every company All Hands meeting every
other week building a world class team
number one okay what's going on there
how's our pipeline doing how's our
internal promotion process doing how's
our Learning and Development classes
going and so forth and so on so that
made it you know in the minds of people
like we got to do this well and everyone
owns this right which was great and that
you know Jeff Jeff was I don't know
where he got that from I'd like to take
credit for but it's all him yeah quick
question Steve before we pivot uh to
remote the transparency factor with comp
I think we've all been living with that
especially the last you know five years
or so and show me the Sal not just my
salary and my market range show me
everyone else's on my team and were you
all transparent with comp and if not
where did you push back and kind of what
did you share with with the whole
employee base versus not why um I would
say we tried to be where we could be as
much
um you know and you've got glass door
which is if you're hiring you know
immigrants you have to you know pose the
r pose the ranges there now it's
required by law obviously to post the
ranges but people could could back into
it we found because we were recruiting
so much that the information's going to
get out so we were like hey let's just
share the stuff um what the the you know
the ranges are was not a big issue for
us we don't have time to you know to
hide that kind of stuff I think where
where things got really complicated I
mean every day was complicated but the
day we went public okay our share price
went berserk it was going up and down
like a you know shock absorber you know
 
to 60 and all the candidates that were
in play were terrified about having
their start date when they'd get priced
be the wrong number the high one right
they want the low one so we pivoted to
rsus and I said uh to the leadership
team I don't want rsus I want only
upside you know I don't want the safety
of a lower number I'm here for a escape
velocity opportunity so we made a
decision as a leadership team that the
executives would only get options and
the rest of the staff would have
rsus and that was problem because all
the employees perceived that as hey
that's better and so what we did we had
to backtrack and we said okay when we're
going through the conversion for new
hire if we'd offered you an option and
we're going to convert it to rsus which
is about you know a third is usually the
number that you know most organizations
use when they do the conversion uh we'll
give you the choice you decide right
what you want which is an impossible
thing and I didn't like it because the
when I talked to Patty about where they
went wrong and I had two Netflix board
members on my board so I knew a lot
about what their comp strategy was they
would give people here's a pile of cash
and you buy as many shares as you want
to buy and they said what would happen
in every people would when the stock
would rise they'd buy it and so they
bought High they'd never buy it when it
was low they would you know not buy it
so you had two people doing the same
thing with a huge difference in their
compensation and that was just something
unintended consequence of just human
nature well and most people don't
understand the difference between
options and rsus and so did you guys try
and educate them on that 100% 100% I
mean we did so much you know so we had
before we went public we had all kinds
of financial advisers come in and we had
to be careful about not favoring one
investor firm over another because all
your companies that are taking you out
they want all the wealth management that
goes with it they want the whole thing
and by the way that is such a racket
this is something I never understood
until I was in the moment Morgan Stanley
I think was the company that took us out
so what Morgan Stanley does is they go
on a road show with your CEO to every
investor pre IPO and say here's our
business plan here's the model here's
why you should invest and they get a
sense for what the Market's willing to
pay so they told us it was like from it
went from like 28 to by the end of the
road show 35 okay the day we went public
it opened at
 
Morgan Stanley does we don't cuz we sold
our shares to Morgan Stanley for 35 or
you know whatever and they said okay so
we'll go sell it
now I'm like in one day you guys made
all that so I'm furious I'm like that is
robbery this is the system's broken
those are a bunch of crooks and so
that's when our CFO said wait a second I
need to explain something he didn't look
worried at all he's like Steve we only
put out to the market this much now that
we know what the Market's willing to
Bear we're going to go out with this
much and we're not going to go through
Morgan Stanley we're going to go right
to the market I was I was like good on
you so then I realized okay so cuz we
you we built this thing us you guys
didn't do anything and you're lucky that
you're the broker you know and so um it
was a real it was a real racket after
that you know that whole secret filing
thing came out where you don't have to
do an S1 now you can do that direct all
these Robin hoods and all these other
things have have come through to sort of
you know democratize it a little bit
more but that that drove me nuts when I
found out about it
I love that story I love that story
because direct listings were really
popular towards the end of the most
recent runup and then those companies
have been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hammered a lot of them
that actually ended up doing that but
this is the reason why so many people
were frustrated with the old model and
like everything in life everything has
trade-offs right for sure right so I
love I love in your book uh Steve you
talked about those serendipitous moments
of you never know who you're going to
meet and where and it creates different
opportunities the same thing happens at
work right with colleagues like I could
see no one in the hallway and we're in
two different departments and Bam we we
chat about something and something else
takes off and the distributed remote
nature of things kind of makes that more
difficult and I I just would love your
take on how do you Council organizations
to try and create those as much as
possible in this environment and what
impact is that having MH we don't know
yet honestly we are you know this is the
hardest part for most of the Business
Leaders that I talk to around the world
and this the biggest question which is
hey Steve who's doing this right I go
nobody and every time in life when we
Face something hard what do we do let's
go Benchmark who's the Benchmark I go
it's time to be the Benchmark and so
they say Steve stay at home hybrid you
know remote and I say yes and they go no
no we're asking you which one I go
yes I said you're going to have to try
and he goes well you know that might not
be fair you know we might not have fair
I said do you pay everyone the same no
okay so you're over the fairness hurdle
so let's not worry about being fair
because you already pay people
differently I said you you you don't
know and I said when by the way when you
say hybrid that's like telling a waiter
at a restaurant who ask you what you
like to eat you say food like food like
do you want warm food cold food vegan
food you know plant-based food um and so
H there's so many forms of hybrid you
know what I love about this moment is
that we're asking questions that have
never been asked why do we meet why are
we together what's the objective what
are we what are we doing there what who
came up with this five-day Work Week
idea that's so healthy I think just like
taking HR down to the studs like I did
at LinkedIn like we never asked those
now we're asking those questions the
problem for a lot of leaders and this is
where all you people who are all Agro
around remote work need to step back and
appreciate every CEO who's never done
remote at the scale we're doing now is
knows what the outcomes are when we work
together I have no idea what the
long-term outcome is when we're remote
so they're scared they're scared they
have no long you know evidence
and so they could take a risk because oh
we're going to hedge that Talent wants
to work more flexibly so we're going to
try it but they don't know they don't
know is there going to be cultural
erosion or cultural strengthening what
about team building what about
connectedness what about Innovation we
just don't know and my gut tells me
because I'm on the era of that's how we
did it uh together in person um
especially when you're growing an an
early stage organization going through
puberty like real time problem solving
is valuable now we're going to learn and
there a lot of really cool examples of
you know hey the way it was wasn't all
great you know I'm getting back hours of
my life and the biggest Miss I think in
the conversation is employees are saying
uh I'm more productive at home but what
they're really meaning is my life is
more productive at home okay not just
work everything connect relationship
Equity seeing my kids when they come
home from school which I never was there
for before and it's a beautiful moment
I'm not going to give that up the long
commutes paying for gas all that other
stuff um and then there's a lot of Youth
who are saying gosh I just you know I
went to school to be part of a team and
now it's just me in the screen like that
is not interesting to me like I want
some kind of social setting and you ask
most people not most you ask a lot of
people where'd you meet your
spouse work at the office work at the
office now maybe in this increased you
know online dating thing you know it's
going to it's going to change but I do
think that it's so early to tell and I
have no you know uh bias one way or the
other I'm leaning towards in person as
pretty as human beings we're made to
sort of be be together and there's an
energy there that's really hard to put
your finger on but I remain open to lots
of really you know um one person might
be interesting for you guys to speak to
about this Barbie Graver who was uh also
at Netflix for a while who was uh head
of HR for a few companies that started
remote um and uh she has a real strong
like really strong point of view on come
on you're just saying that because
that's what you know and the whole water
cooler thing wasn't fair to begin with
you know so I think we're learning and I
think the best thing a company can do is
not take a position right now and say
for the next three months we're going to
try this we're going to learn we're
going to see how our customers feel how
you feel how the business feels how our
investors feel and then we're going to
Pivot and adjust are you good with that
okay great love frame it frame it as an
experiment yeah exactly and I've I don't
know about you two but I've been pretty
disappointed um even in myself in a lot
of ways and I think we do have Colleen
said it on our session Nolan right we
have kind of a copycat type culture what
are they doing what are they doing and
and I feel like everyone's just been
like the questions we're asking around
this just have not been good enough it's
it's in office or out very binary it's
all or nothing it's office it's
notal these companies are different
these companies are way different
companies are different and no one's
asking why the hell do we care forget
about the building and if it's empty and
if money's going I mean I understand
that's important but why are people
coming together and and just now like
I'm hearing now more moments that matter
and which I love but why are we getting
people together or not right people can
go in three days a week and you can
check your box and they're not doing
jack [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're just sitting there and
not so I don't know I've been
disappointed in how we've been thinking
about this I completely agree going slow
and taking as it comes versus coming
fast at the gate here's our point of
view a week after you know it's just and
you saw all these companies clawing it
back just kidding we made a mistake yeah
Steve I really appreciate your
intellectual honesty on this and then I
I I really I have a take on this that I
want your feedback on which is companies
that are pre-product Market fit are much
different than companies that are post-
product Market fit and then that are
much different than companies with like
incredible incredibly deep Network
effects LinkedIn had an incredibly deep
Network effect every company that has
deep Network effects ultimately goes
hybrid or remote or whatever because it
becomes a function of getting as much
talent as possible I think at the
earliest stage it is probably better to
be in person given that there are
trade-offs that you won't be able to
hire everybody in the world but that's
not the problem you're trying to solve
right now the problem you're trying to
solve right now is getting to product
Market fit do you do you view the world
similarly what's your thoughts on that I
do and the other the other part of this
that a lot of leaders I speak to fail to
appreciate but it's a it's an obvious
one in retrospect which is we're all
going to this remote from a different
perspective maybe my company's been
around 10 years and everyone knows each
other we haven't had a lot of churn when
we go remote we've got that muscle
memory we know what's what if you're
going remote and you're adding 50%
growth to your Workforce you know the
degree of complexity is just far greater
than a team that's going more remote
that's already got the muscle memory
it's not going through lots of turnover
you know so we're how every team's
approaching it the kind of business that
that folks are in it's very very
different and so um but I generally
agree with you the earlier stage earlier
product Market fit sort of where you in
the evolution I do think the real-time
problem solving is pretty pretty pretty
essential to you and I've not seen that
realized in a super remote framework yet
I want to talk about Blitz scaling so
Reed Hoffman coined this term uh and and
he wrote a book about it you were
essentially head of Blitz scaling at
LinkedIn and when I read
reads book about this it seems like oh
like once you have product Market fit
and you just like boom you step on the
gas and you go it's never that clean
internally and I'm just I want to get
your take on what didn't go well with
blitz scaling at LinkedIn and what you
learned about that biggest uh mistake I
have for you is at some point we
realized hey I think we're going we're
going to make this thing and uh so let's
go uh look around the table has anyone
here run a billion dollar business the
answer was nope not even close so well
let's go get some people who run a
billion dollar business who can teach us
and show us the way so we did we went
out and got two hires in um you know
different parts of the business
marketing and sales that had lead you
know billion dollar portfolios and they
both failed
miserably and they failed because they
didn't build a billion dollar industry
they just led a billion dollar industry
so they would come in and say okay
where's my six admins and uh you know
then we can get going we're like we
don't have admins here you know and if
we do they're shared by three Executives
like what are you talking about and they
were just paralyzed in fear of how
chaotic things were and so you know
that's when we realized at that early
phase Blitz killing you really need
Builders man you need people that just
Groove off of crazy that realize the
highest source of energy in the universe
is chaos and and that can be a good
thing and they they are good people at
bringing order from nothing uh and
they're hard hard they were really hard
to find back then so that was a huge
mistake you know that we made Reed has
admitted like when Jeff came in Jeff
came in because Reed made a bad mistake
in his first CEO hire so he was first
CEO and then he hired this guy Dan NY
but the there was massive confusion in
the organization well who should we go
to should we go to Reed who's basically
the human embodiment of Yoda if you've
ever met re like the guy is like
incredible um and I think Lucas probably
looked to Reed for inspiration when he
thought of the Yoda character but anyway
so you should we go to Reed or should we
go to Dan and Reed and you know has said
like I confused that I didn't let Dan
run the show so when Jeff came Reed
stopped coming to the office so much and
he wasn't there so much so that you know
differentiation gets to I think one of
the you know challenges that every
organization faes when you Blitz scale
is uh as Jeff used to say jobs are going
to outgrow people
people are not going to tell you that
they've the jobs outgrown them like is
any pitcher going to say hey coach Take
Me Out The Game's a little too intense
for me right now I think there needs to
be a sub you know no and so how are we
going to do that and then when you get
really successful and you both have had
these rides there's a lot of money
writing on it there's a lot of
reputational equity like why did you
leave LinkedIn like you knucklehead like
that thing was on a rocket ship like
something bad must have happened you
know so when when it's not working and
jobs of outgrown people like how do we
deal with that in a way with gravitas
and respect um but also speed because we
need someone in who kind of can help get
us to the next level right and some
people are going to grow and roll and
some people aren't right and that's
really that's really hard it's really
really hard and and also when you've not
had leaders go through that they're not
thinking about that
necessarily um they're not paying
attention to that so that was I think
there there was a a bunch of Reed was I
sat next to Jeff and then the office on
the other side was Reed and any chance I
got and those two guys Jeff andry could
not have been more different I mean I'm
so happy that relationship worked but as
human
beings very you know sort of ying and
yang if you will like they're very
different but boy that worked really
really well th those are the ones that
come to mind noan when you ask the
question the hiring Builders versus
hiring people who inherited the business
at scale is such an interesting lens how
did you guys figure that out like how
did you actually like assess for
Builders and because a lot of people who
have done this never want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do
it
again right was it the pedigree like you
mentioned looking it in that camp right
there no way it's really hard yeah it's
like there's
never I used to go into my one-on ones
with Jeff and say Do You Hear That Sound
he goes what's that I go those are all
the balls I'm dropping right now I was
like I you know and then he would go
Steve I told you just prioritize the top
three things and focus on those I goeff
when I bring the top three to you I come
out with 1 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 2 a 2 B so it's
like it's 15 in Disguise like you know I
can't do everything and as a
perfectionist as someone who really has
a you know a high you know
self-confidence I don't want to let
someone else do my I want to do my stuff
and my biggest problem was you know
saying no uh so that was I mean that's
just sort of the the challenge is what
are you going to focus on and and I
think that's where Jeff got really good
is he would s he would sort of pull me
off of the ceiling and say just focus on
this you know and and he had to do that
a lot cuz he I never saw Jeff
overwhelmed but all of us generally
would get there A lot of times and and
so what we what do we look for we look
for you know people had been in similar
kind of crazy growth environments uh and
Who had who had a little bit of an edge
you know like you got to you got to have
an edge and we got I don't know uh Kelly
did you know David hanky at all when you
were at uh at Yahoo and the name yes but
not personally so he this is another
great story about Jeff and sort of the
early days of LinkedIn so David was
known as a if there was a head of
operations you know we're talking about
keep the systems together you know the
engineers do their thing but they keep
the the operations keeps the systems
together David was a swashbuckler I mean
no sentence would not include several
curse words and Jeff looked at him like
I don't know if this company's ready for
him so we got the most Prim and proper
people in operations to interview David
and say you know are are you going to be
scared of this guy is it is he going to
be cultural Kryptonite is he going to
just break us and they're like no we
love him and we love the fact that he's
colorful and all that um but he had a he
it's like the crazier it was the happier
he got similar to Jeff like and that it
took us a while to start to identify
that but we would seek that in your
experiences and and you know and things
like that and the other similar thing
that really worked for us in terms of
how we identified people that would
really Groove On Us was we got our head
of engineering um Kevin Scott who's now
the CTO of Microsoft published a book uh
recently he came to us because he'd been
at uh Google for a while and all these
people were hired above him who'd never
done what he'd done inside the company
he's like the you know the shiny new
object is coming over me and he's
getting you know people getting hired
over him so like so let's not have that
happen here come on in here let's build
this right and you know we were able to
get him because they had sort of that
cultural norm over there that he just
really despised you know Steve you you
mentioned and so did Patty in our chat
that it's actually a great time to be in
this business right it's it's blank
slate it's new practices not best
practices I mean we can lean into
redefining all of this but yet you got
you both would never do it again till
hell froze over what why why is that and
because I'm hearing that from a lot of
HR leaders I don't want to go back in
that seat what is that phenomenon yeah I
think it's you know honestly if I'm
honest I'm like I fear I fear myself I
really fear myself like I am not good at
saying no Haven haven't been I've gotten
better over time um I'm a perfectionist
I take take a lot on the best advice I
got when I became the first uh head
first time head of HR was from a boss
that had an AMD yoland Gonzalez and I
said what should I know yoland like I've
never been had of HR I'm going to be
going to this Canadian company and she
said you got more stuff to worry about
you're going to have to figure out how
to deal with all that stuff and I don't
miss that I don't miss and here's the
the the biggest heart AE I had over that
experience for me was having three young
kids when I was home I wasn't
home and uh I what broke it for me that
led to my final you know decision to go
which was very like on the moment um I
didn't think about it very long but it
was a Friday and my son uh it was the
fall and it was like trick-or treat or
something coming up and he's like
Friday's like Dad are you gonna be home
early tonight and I said oh yeah he goes
 
n it's real six-year-old like oh my gosh
what have I done right and so I had an
enormous parental guilt uh I feel like
I've sort of you know made up for that
uh maybe much to my uh now teenage boys
disappoint that I'm all up in their
stuff but um I think that was probably
that was probably it for me is it a is
it like a a contact high absolutely you
know doing it's like really really great
I'm very proud of the stuff I did the
LinkedIn stuff wasn't the most
satisfying career spot for me it was
another position that it had in Canada
but I'm so proud what we did and the the
culture that lasts today but it's like
I've I've done that and I will Coach
anyone who's in that situation I got you
um but no I'm not ready for full
fulltime yeah I feel like you just
described what I'm feeling as far as the
balance but Lo loving the drug I mean
it's very addictive yeah it is it it is
so just to wrap up we'd like to have a a
rapid fire segment we we call Talent
rules and two quick quick questions for
you one is who's you been your best hire
in your career and why for any reason
okay uh let's see I uh I thought uh of
someone who is sort of like way early in
my career but I'm going to go with an
internal move that we made one time so
it wasn't an outside hire so we had a
individual named Arman vetan talked
about him in my book it's incredible
story he's sitting in accounting and he
was happy in accounting I know it's hard
for us HR people to realize that Finance
people like what they do are mortal
enemy those Finance people Aran was
training to be an Olympian for The
Armenian uh Olympic team as a marathon
runner and he was failing in his
capacity to train he wasn't putting in
enough hours on his job and we it was
like really wearing on him so he comes
in and we knew this was about to happen
so the CFO also named Steve Steve
sordello and I knew this was about to
happen and so Armen comes in and said he
wanted to meet with both of us and he
hands us his resignation okay here is
someone who we thought was a cultural
ambassador to LinkedIn just a great
everyone loved him uh and he was just
you know so into fitness and this is
early days for us so he hands me the
note and I rip it up right in front of
him and he's like what are you doing I
said Armen there's no way we are going
to let you leave this organization we
want to help you realize your dream so
we're going to ask if you would be
interested in building a fitness program
for us you know a Wellness Center this
is before Wellness became mental
Wellness this was back in the you know
and so I said would you be willing to do
that he goes you would do that and I
said yeah and it can be part-time and
help us out with some facilities too but
we want you to introduce that here if
you would like to do that he starts
crying the CFO starts crying I mean I'm
in HR I'm crying all the time so I'm
start crying and that I'll never forget
that moment because it was us living
this will be the best place that you've
ever worked and the CFO was signing up
to put you know his person over the
probably because he could control the
budget with an accountant over the
wellness but so that was just one of my
favorite favorite stories uh sort of an
internal hire yeah that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
awesome Steve that's awesome Steve
crying is also very cool we do we do cry
a lot
Steve I want to know what your favorite
interview question is that get you the
best signal on
candidates um all right I'm going to
answer this but I'm going to preface it
by saying I think interviews are the
worst predictors of uh hiring success
you know and unfortunately we don't have
a replacement I wish the world would
give us the opportunity for everyone to
take us you know like a three-month
pause every 3 years and we get to try
out another job and if we like it we
stay and if we don't we go back work
trials are the future a
th% yeah and it's really really hard so
what I what I I don't have a question
but I begin every interview with please
walk me through everything on your CV
why did you leave what are you most
proud of um and that usually it's a
story I'm looking for and I'm trying to
see how I fit into that story and I'm
trying to see what stands out and what
they're saying what boss was great what
boss was a nightmare and what the key
considerations were what I'm trying to
do in an interview is and there's I was
talking to some students in Portugal
last week and I'm like listen most
people don't know how to interview so my
advice to you is control it and say
these are the five to 10 things I want
to land because they don't know how to
interview and most of them who are
really bad they want you to like them so
that's what they're trying to do so
don't let them talk you may think it's
all good they're not asking me any
questions that's a fail right so so T so
take control what I'm trying to do is
get the interviewee to stop giving me
what they think I want to hear and we're
all conditioned with all these blah blah
you tell me about a weakness oh my
weakness is I work too hard total
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like oh God total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I
don't know how to delegate right right
right people just are so you know
they're just they think I'm just like o
you know overtaking everyone with my
work ethic you know like come on man so
uh yeah so that's one that I just like
just let's have a human conversation you
want to bring in whatever you know bring
bring to me but I want to know who sort
of who you are and that's what you know
when I think about I just did my first
pitch on the future of artificial
intelligence and what it means for for
HR and why I'm excited and I'm more
terrified than am excited if I'm honest
but why I'm excited is because we're
going to be able to really find who
people really are and match them to
opportunities that really fit who they
are in the future I think better than we
ever have uh and we got to get to it
could be creepy could be exciting phase
first in terms of what we know but you
know who I am as an individual like
we're just not surfacing that stuff
right now like what what shaped me my
parents divorce is that anywhere in my
CV no what shaped me was getting kicked
out of South Africa when I was 7 years
old and having to learn to speak
American and getting teased mercilessly
by kids that shaped me you know like
that no one's talking about that like
can I adapt oh yeah I got you I've lived
in four different countries and six
different Industries like are you paying
attention to that stuff right and I
think I think what AI will do it will it
will mitigate the bad interviewers out
there a little bit more because we don't
know how to do it generally speaking
right right even in HR by the way that's
music to my ears I do not like
interviewing I am not great at it nobody
does Kelly Nobody Does it turns out
everyone thinks it's full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it
is yeah right yeah some of it are these
words interviewing performance review I
mean these words [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck you have
to change them and that's you this is a
big that's a big topic for me we need to
change the language of work like things
like loyalty things like happiness come
on really what is loyalty I say today
people are are loyal to learning they're
not loyal to a company make me better
for the future don't promise me a job if
you did I'm not going to believe you but
if you make me better whether we part
ways or not it's all good and by the way
yeah care about me for my whole career
right I loved in your book I think it
was I don't know what what company it
was but people were bonused on whether
or not their employees stayed that's
insane to me I know I I have had that
bonus I don't know if you guys have but
that that I I just and Patty described
it really well it's like okay so
why are you guys measuring retention
because we haven't come up with any new
ones yeah exactly you know we need a new
map for a new world of work right and
and we've got to we got to do a better
job of that totally all right Steve this
has been incredible but our audience is
Founders execs and employees and so the
last thing I want to ask you is do you
have advice for for our audience uh
about what they can do to better prepare
themselves for
 
basically going into 2024 is recognize
that learning and growth is part of the
new compensation stack of the future
work and I'm not talking about classes
with your professors from MIT Stanford
Cal I'm talking about new assignments
new experiences new opportunities in
rooll will unlock energy that will get
the work not to feel like work as Simon
says you know it's all about the why and
it's all about the how so we are
increasingly finding that to find
Qualified people is increasingly
impossible we I began my career you
don't hire someone El you're 95%
qualified today I think we're around 60
 
you're going to re-engineer the job so I
don't need that extra 30 40% that I
can't find or I'm going to fill it by
moving people around we're going to have
to move from a buy Talent economy to a
build Talent economy that is the future
so as you're thinking about how to lay
the foundations don't be so worried
about I don't have all the experience I
you want that experience because you
want to accelerate your opportunity to
you know to thrive but you also uh want
it because you don't know how to grow
people you don't know how to develop
people and if you can get comfortable
with that that's going to lower your
risk of not being able to recruit so
well because that experienced talent
pool is never going to come back I
believe in this economy right
now amen Steve so great thank you so
much for the time thank you so much
Steve thanks for having
me oh where is that teach how to use
Tech Kelly just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off put you in that
squared put you in that boxing ring dude
yeah so what is your story did you you
have like I have an amateur career let's
go all right so the the the thing that
everyone should know is is that I
started MMA like three months ago and
every I do it every Monday and the
reason I do it every Monday at 9:00 am
is because I get my ass kicked by a guy
who had seven fights in the UFC and so
literally by we can only go up from
there it is the very bottom and the the
entire humiliation of Monday morning and
so I started filming it started MMA cuz
Zach does it down the street from where
I live get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of
here but it's like no matter how many
people hate me for the open to work
badge open to work Ramsey will kick my
ass on Monday and it's just all it's
just all easy from there I've gotten
trolled so much hey don't hey open to
work I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well life is this
green [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] badge I'm dreaming about
um so anyways Kelly we're gonna shift
from the open to work badge uh because
I've been burned at the stake on
LinkedIn I'm not upset that we're
shifting okay to I think a much more
vanilla topic uh which is hate speech in
the office uh and the reason why is
because of what's going on in Israel and
there's been a couple of companies who
have had
employees make comments in public slack
channels inside the company like about
what's going on there and in in a couple
of cases one at Apple I believe the
other one was at Wix those companies
have terminated those
employees I'm curious to get your take
on this and what what you're seeing if
there's anything going on right now
inside of pendo or how you guys are are
communicating uh about what is okay and
not inside of a
company yeah I I'm pretty stickler in
this one Nolan I have a zero tolerance
for right the those types of comments
starkly against other PE I mean again we
talked about a little bit with um a
couple segments ago right is is the the
bottom line is the inclusivity and the
respect and the company values that you
sign up when you go into that company
right with other people in that company
so I I think it's actually one of the
easiest lines to draw fully agree with
terminating fully agree with like
targeted towards someone else that's on
your team and wearing the same Jersey
and company that you're wearing is a no
no that's really interesting I I fully
agree with you I don't know if the line
is black and white I I think it is from
where I sit but I I could see another
person's perspective on it and I think
specifically in this case I think in
both of these cases it has been folks
internally coming out in support of
Palestine and I think their their
perspective I am not defending it to be
clear and in fact like I live on the
other side of this debate but I I'm
trying to be intellectually honest sure
and put myself in their shoes they're
saying well we're having this discussion
now internally I'd like to submit my
perspective
and I like how do you think about that
look we started this by saying hate
speech yeah that is very different than
I support Israel or I support Palestine
or I support blank in the right forums
with the boundaries set within that
company those two things are very
different what I'm talking about is
literally targeted hate speech against
someone else that is different than I'm
going to speak in the forums that the
company agrees to and I adhere to about
what I support or I don't support yep it
I'll just I'll bring up what I brought
up in our last conversation around
politics at work I think this is
furthering the point of politics at work
is a very complicated and slippery slope
and my take continues to be which I
think we're starting to see right now
publicly it's so hard to draw lines and
then have those lines move with current
events that it just feels like it's so
much easier to just to not have those
discussions especially on slack where
people are trying to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done and
work is thought of as as a reprieve for
many people from what is actually going
on in the world yes and I think that
that's okay and I think more people are
starting to come around to like can I
just get my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done at work and not
have to worry about you know being at C
being at CNN
well on slack yeah I mean I'm I'm
personally getting closer to that just
because of everything that's going on I
do think the lines are
blurring I just where I where I stand
Nolan is to not be sensitive to how
those things might be impacting people
and maybe that maybe that's hey take
time off yeah right maybe it's
leadership being more sensitive to when
people are being affected by that yeah
if those things can't be talked about at
work for whatever reason the thing that
makes me stress dressed out and I'm not
in the CPO role right now and I really
feel for those in that role is the
slippery slope of those when those
things show up outside of work right
when there is some when there's someone
very aggressive hate speech Etc in
forums that are not within the firewalls
of a company that's where it gets really
difficult oh interesting so you're
saying Company employee post something
like on
Twitter correct or LinkedIn again what
believe in support is one thing I'm
talking about hate speech when someone
is going the
 
obviously of company values that they
adhere to at work that's when it becomes
really
hard I totally agree and you know again
like I want to be very clear I think
what happened is an absolute
atrocity but America does stand at least
for companies within the United States
States America does stand for free
speech and I think hate speech is the
the for sure line and where that line is
actually being drawn right now I think
is really tough that's actually I think
exactly what happened in the wix's case
in the wix's case it was an employee who
who said something on social media and
then was terminated for what they said
on social media and Kelly I would I
would even terminate the person for if I
saw it internally of what they posted
externally on social media I would ter
them for that would you yeah I think so
I mean I I you know tend to be more of a
let's let's get into the context and the
information so I'm not going to sit up
here I'm gonna like I always always look
at every detail every side but for me
you always know I love to go to the
bottom line it's it's do I feel safe and
do I feel like I
belong I think that that's those things
framewor matter you can apply it to
anything
I think it's a really good framework and
I think it's a really good framework for
chap people officers and CEOs as they
are navigating this I I just want to
continue to reiterate that I don't think
the world is getting less complex in
fact I think it's getting more complex
and the more complex it gets the more
complex it gets internally to your
company for how you navigate these
things and so I would just I would
encourage Theos to think about this now
especially going into the new year and
um I will tell you it is a breath of
fresh air for me to turn off Twitter to
turn off the news to come to work uh and
to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done with my homies that's
really fun and I don't have to worry
about politics here and I I think a lot
of more a lot more people are coming
around to that idea I agree that the
world is becoming more complex versus
less and I just wish you know we we
would say that more right everyone has
to have an answer what's your view what
are we going to do and sometimes it's
like uh I don't know I'm really stressed
out I'm in over my head I'm personally
overwhelmed this sucks
overall and I don't I don't know someone
asked me you know what what is the role
of a chief people officer recently and I
said the role our role is to help
leaders live in the goddamn gray like
our role is to help folks walk in
everyone's shoes
and and actually see the gray versus
Force sometimes a black or white line
it's not that I don't have a point of
view or no backbone but it is important
I'm with you I think that's a great
frame of people have to live in the gray
and a cheat people officer needs to help
them do that I think the chief people
officer can also reduce the gray nothing
is black and white especially when
you're dealing with humans but otherwise
you just spend so much time time going
through these cycles and then you're not
building the business like a lot a lot
of this stuff is just not building it's
not business building yeah it's
distractions no you're right I mean we
gotta eliminate those yeah we could
spend all day but that's what I mean
what is the simple way to cut through
inclusivity and belonging one example
yeah and when is when is it a time not
to cut through and actually stop and be
thoughtful so audience we would love to
hear from you all uh ping me and Kelly
directly by the way many of you have
over the last couple of weeks we
thoroughly enjoy it we're trying to
bring those topics into the show and so
keep pinging us because we know how hard
it is in the seat and oftentimes you
can't say things publicly and we want to
be that voice for you we want to talk
about the really hairy topics so ping us
