# Ex-Amazon Director's Viral Post Exposes Tech's Broken Employment Contract

## Transcript

 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another Heretics segment. Kelly, today
we are going to talk about a LinkedIn
post that went berserk on X this
weekend. So, here's the context. Amazon
did a very large layoff last week. You
and I have been talking about big tech
layoffs for a while. They're continuing.
In fact, I think they're accelerating at
many places. And a woman who is a
director at Amazon, her name is Rochelle
Rochelle Tate, put this on her public
LinkedIn. She said, "Given the recent
layoffs across Amazon and other major
corporations, this may be a hot take,
but I wanted to share a perspective from
someone who's been in the job market for
nearly a year and is a proud ex
Amazonian. If companies truly want to
attract ex Amazon talent, there has to
be alignment. Many of us are Seattle
based, so roles need to offer true
remote flexibility. In today's economy,
relocation isn't always feasible,
especially for those with families and
the risk involved. Compensation should
reflect 10 to 15 plus years of
experience, and we value clear,
efficient interview processes with a
defined end goal. It's not just about
hiring someone who worked at Amazon.
It's about recognizing the level of
ownership, scale, and impact that
experience brings and building roles and
a business model that reflect that. So,
that was her note. Kelly, what's your
take? Well, first of all, just to keep
with the the the real talk humor as
always, Nolan, I I said I I'm having a
case in the Mondays today. You know, for
those of you who love the the movie
Office Space, but I don't know what it
is. I'm just kind of like meh little
crank today. So, this this hot take, I
was like, "Oh gosh, double whammy." Um,
it's a good one though. I'd love to talk
about it. And first of all, I I respect,
you know, Michelle putting this out
there, right? I mean, it's it's a
sticking your neck out post and not
everyone's going to agree and she said
it's a hot take, so it's great that
we're talking about it. But [snorts] I
do respect her putting that out there. I
think, you know, [clears throat] my
headline, Nolan, is and feedback for
Michelle is this post is full of like
multiple assumptions in my opinion that
might not necessarily be true.
So, let me ask you first of all, what
was the ripple? Like what what was the
the reaction to this on X that you you
clearly read through?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw this probably I saw this
image of her LinkedIn post re-shared
four times at least.
&gt;&gt; And essentially, it's this is someone
who's out of touch with the market
reality. This is somebody who has very
high ego and what appears to be an
attitude problem and this kind of feels
emblematic of a lot of folks who have
been laid off from big tech jobs that
they feel like they deserve more from
what the current job market has to
offer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can see why that
would be the case. I it's interesting to
me like I'd love to actually maybe
she'll come on and have a chat with us
but
&gt;&gt; some of these statements just really
aren't true anymore. I mean true remote
flexibility that is
&gt;&gt; over
&gt;&gt; up to every company
&gt;&gt; that is up to every company and is like
largely over from a true remote company
standpoint. I would say the ones that
are truly remote today were like that
before co like that's just who they are
you know so [snorts] that was an odd
statement I think um you know ex Amazon
I just I love brands and I love you know
these fang companies but not everyone
bows down to
ex fang company of choice do you know
what I mean so I just again it's kind of
a a little bit of lot of assumptions in
this postnal and and maybe I'm just kind
of like flabbergasted because here I am
 
like afraid of like getting fired like
I'm still like impostor. I'm still like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do I deserve this salary? So I'm
just kind of like damn I kind of wish I
had that mindset. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Look here's my take is I think
this is emblematic of how a lot of
people feel and you know we're exiting
an era. So, there's this chart, and we
should do another segment on this,
Kelly, but there's this chart that
basically shows like employment was
growing up until Chat GBT launched in
like 2022, and then it's basically
fallen off a cliff. The other thing, you
know, people are talking about this
online. It's like it's a little bit of
chart crime cuz the other thing that
happened at that time is that interest
rates went up and so investors put more
of an emphasis on profits. It's no
longer growth at all costs, right? It's
grow plus run a highly efficient
business. And so, you know, we went
through this whole thing. You and I have
covered this a million times. I don't
think that memo got to some of these
employees
and I don't think they're aware. And so,
look, I have so many friends that are in
unbelievably talented
that can't find the job that they want
right now. I know you're in the same
boat. Like, we have a mutual friend. It
took her a very long time to find a job.
And you know, if you think about it,
ultimately in a market right now, like
the employer is in control.
And so putting this out there on her
LinkedIn one is certainly not going to
help her. Like I think that's like super
obvious. I I've been telling a bunch of
my friends, I'm like, you should be
going through people's LinkedIn post,
their comments, their ex, like
everything, right? To figure out like
what this person is actually like. So I
don't think that's going to help. The
other kind of like orthogonal take, and
I've had this kind of like cooking for a
couple of years, and my timing's been
wrong, but I think it's I think it's
ultimately going to come to fruition. I
think the next era of social unrest is
going to come from tech workers who are
making hundreds of thousands of dollars
per year that had great jobs that were
working, you know, 40 to 50 hours a week
that no longer have those opportunities.
And it's in the form of all things.
compensation's lower, work is harder,
remote is gone, all these things that we
offered people during the great
resignation, the rug has been pulled.
And I can see this next era of social
unrest really coming from these tech
workers who built their lives
and candidly a lot of their expectations
on Zerp era stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you and I both know, I mean, you're
grinding. You're back in the office. I'm
working my ass off right now. And I'm
working harder than I think I've ever
worked. And it's like if we're doing
that and other people don't expect to do
that, I think reality is going to be
very, very challenging.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were kind of touching on
something I was thinking about before
you started and you're right. Like I
logged into Riverside to start this
today. Nolan's on the horn like put up
his finger. Two minutes, two minutes
grinding and I'm like great, I have
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] two minutes. I'm going to go
grind on something I was doing. Like
&gt;&gt; I guess I guess for me and this is
independent of this post, you know, but
it hits on some of the things I felt
when reading her post is exactly to your
point around expectations.
Like I never have them. I'm always like
fighting, grinding, proving, networking,
helping others. I think you hit on
something really important where it's
like just because you did something for
x number of years somewhere doesn't mean
that you just deserve to have it all the
time without maybe having to give up
some stuff or adapt or you know
compromise.
So that to me is maybe maybe this is how
it was raised. I don't really know what
it is, Nolan. But to your point, for me,
I'll be really honest with you, it
wasn't hard to find this job, but there
is a reason for that is because you're
always paranoid. You're always hustling
in some capacity. You're always helping
people and like
connecting with people and doing things
outside. I just think you're right. Like
if I was at a fang company for 15 years,
the worst thing you could do is live in
that cocoon and never look up and out.
We've talked about this before. It's no
surprise. So
&gt;&gt; again, just the assumptions, it's it's
very it's very it's not it's not good.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. MetaView is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metiv's suite of AI agents works for you
at every stage of the hiring process.
Their platform powers instant job postc
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metiv changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Deal, 11 Labs, and Kora and check out
Metaview. Just head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts or get started for free. You'll
be uprunning an AI enabled in minutes.
&gt;&gt; Dude, I know. But so here's like I I
actually really get where she's coming
from. And it kind of feels like the
contract between employer and employee
has changed so fast that people's mental
models haven't had time to update. I
think another good analogy here is like
what's happening with colleges, right?
So this is kind of like the barbell
situation. On one side, you have new
grads who can't find jobs and they were
told by their parents, their teachers,
people who influenced them in their
lives, if you go to a good school and
you get good grades, you will have
opportunity.
That's not true anymore. That's
objectively not true. Then on the other
side, you know, for people who have put
in their time, right? It's like you had
to put your time in. You had to grind
when you were in your early 20s. like
you had to keep grinding, you had to
work your way up the corporate ladder,
but once you get there, right, life's
going to be a lot easier. That's the
story my dad told me when I was a kid.
That is also not true. What's also not
true about that second piece is that if
you go work for a name brand company,
the Google's, the Amazons, the Netflixes
of the world, the next job you find will
be easier because of the halo effect
that that brand has.
That's also not true anymore. In fact, I
think it like sometimes works against
people. Like if you've only worked at
dope companies, right, the perception
from especially, you know, in our world,
Kelly, early stage startups is like,
well, you haven't gone through real
adversity. You don't know what it's like
to not work at a non- monopoly business.
Like, you don't know what it's like to
compete against the monopolies. And so,
like, you know, you're off in the ivory
tower when we're in the trench warfare.
And so, there aren't analoges. I'm not
saying that that's true necessarily. I'm
just telling you that that is what the
sound bite is.
&gt;&gt; Well, there was a belief.
&gt;&gt; How many people get it
&gt;&gt; there? Well, it's hard to get it if you
haven't read it, experienced it. And and
I was raised the same way, right? Even
career-wise, it was almost like sold as
making tenure in academia. Like at a
certain point, you're golden. You can't
be fired. You can't do this. You're
going to be taken care of. That is that
is completely not the case. And I'll be
honest, I was thinking about it last
week. I was like, geez, been working
forever, live in the Bay Area, still not
enough. Here we go. Kids, houses, this,
what am I do? But honestly, Nolan,
that's why a lot of people I know,
they're like, listen, I'm going to leave
and I'm going to go buy a house in Texas
or some other state because I don't want
to feel that anymore. And that's that's
some of the fork we've been seeing with
people too in this time. We talked about
it like a year ago I think where you
know this new phase has accelerated
people's thinking about what do I want
and there has been a bit of a fork in
the road with people ejecting from tech
or whatever it is and being like quality
of life and I think that's a fine
conversation I've thought of it too but
the bottom line is has changed and if I
I almost would rather see a post of like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I wish I would have done X, Y, and
Z like 10 years ago while I was working
at these companies so that
&gt;&gt; I wasn't feeling like this, which I
empathize with
and I have a lot more variety of choice.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I think what needs to be
true moving forward is everyone needs to
reunderite the fundamentals of this
market in this point in time. the stuff
that was happening from essentially 2012
through early 2022 is over. Some of
those messages still apply, but I think
a lot of them are slowly working
themselves out. And it's just like a
stock picker, right? It's like if you
were an analyst of a stock and something
has dramatically changed in that
business or in the market conditions,
you wouldn't just, you know, blindly
keep buying. You would rewrite it. You
would say the fundamentals here have
changed and I need to apply new logic to
these fundamentals. And that's what's
going on in this job market. [snorts]
Like it is tough. It is so tough out
there. I still don't think mainstream
media really understands like how brutal
the tech market is. It is incredibly
cutthroat. There are great people that
do not have jobs that are been out of
work for a very long time. And it's
going to require sacrifices
in some way, shape, or form that are
different than what you had to sacrifice
as part of this last runup. The last
thing I'll say on this topic is, you
know, the old adage is like expectations
minus reality equals happiness.
And I think if your expectations are
really high going into this market, you
are going to be deeply unsatisfied with
what you're met with on the other side.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And again, I just want to end as
well by saying, I mean, I empathize,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; with with, you know, Relle, and I've
been there. It's very frustrating. And
to use your stock analogy, the last
thing I'll say is I don't care if you're
at a fang company only for 30 years. But
you got to hedge your bets. You have to
invest in a variety of different stocks.
And even if you work at the same place
for 30 years, Amazon or other, you can
hedge your bets in a variety of ways.
through networking, through assignments.
I mean, I personally like taking stints
in early stage and fang company. I mean,
you just get all of these different
pathways and it does it does hedge bets.
&gt;&gt; Yep, that's good advice. So, we're
rooting for you guys. Keep us posted on
how it's going. We'll talk to you soon.
