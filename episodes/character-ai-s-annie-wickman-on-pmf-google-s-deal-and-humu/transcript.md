So, you know,
 
So, you know,
LLO was the CHRO at Google and he's kind
 
LLO was the CHRO at Google and he's kind
of like this mystic figure. Like I was
 
of like this mystic figure. Like I was
at Google for a few years and like Llo
 
at Google for a few years and like Llo
was like the like the guy and everybody
 
was like the like the guy and everybody
looked up to him and I think as part of
 
looked up to him and I think as part of
this era of you know employees first. I
 
this era of you know employees first. I
think Google led that
 
think Google led that
charge. What was it like being the first
 
charge. What was it like being the first
non-founder at a company that LLO was
 
non-founder at a company that LLO was
the CEO of? It was amazing. I think, you
 
the CEO of? It was amazing. I think, you
know, Lozel is an amazing leader. He's a
 
know, Lozel is an amazing leader. He's a
really kind human, fun. So, it was
 
really kind human, fun. So, it was
awesome to get to go work with him again
 
awesome to get to go work with him again
and learn, you know, from his leadership
 
and learn, you know, from his leadership
style. And and then also just like the
 
style. And and then also just like the
being the first, you know, non-founder
 
being the first, you know, non-founder
in a company is also a really cool
 
in a company is also a really cool
experience because you get to or I got
 
experience because you get to or I got
to wear lots of different hats and
 
to wear lots of different hats and
really get firsthand experience about
 
really get firsthand experience about
what all the people across the company
 
what all the people across the company
are doing. So I did some C customer
 
are doing. So I did some C customer
support. I did some sales. I did some
 
support. I did some sales. I did some
finance and then of course like hired
 
finance and then of course like hired
the the professionals into those roles
 
the the professionals into those roles
and hired myself out of them. But it
 
and hired myself out of them. But it
just gave me a lot more sense of those
 
just gave me a lot more sense of those
parts of the business than I had ever
 
parts of the business than I had ever
had before and would have ever had if I
 
had before and would have ever had if I
hadn't done them. So it's a really
 
hadn't done them. So it's a really
really eye opening role for me. the
 
really eye opening role for me. the
first employee role is is kind of like
 
first employee role is is kind of like
it's
 
it's
brutal. And you know, I was a founder.
 
brutal. And you know, I was a founder.
That's really the only new reason I know
 
That's really the only new reason I know
is because like I had to go do it as a
 
is because like I had to go do it as a
founder and then hire the first employee
 
founder and then hire the first employee
and then you know, shout out to my girl
 
and then you know, shout out to my girl
Jaci who had probably more
 
Jaci who had probably more
responsibilities than anybody. But I
 
responsibilities than anybody. But I
think in general with like early
 
think in general with like early
employees, unless you've been one, it's
 
employees, unless you've been one, it's
hard to
 
hard to
empathize like all the things you go
 
empathize like all the things you go
through. Did you have that same kind of
 
through. Did you have that same kind of
like epiphany moment when working at
 
like epiphany moment when working at
Humu? Totally. Yeah. You have to set up
 
Humu? Totally. Yeah. You have to set up
the bank account and like get credit
 
the bank account and like get credit
cards and you know it's just all the
 
cards and you know it's just all the
little things that you join a company
 
little things that you join a company
and and you know the expense system just
 
and and you know the expense system just
works and when you're first in like you
 
works and when you're first in like you
don't have an expense system so you have
 
don't have an expense system so you have
to figure out like which one to use and
 
to figure out like which one to use and
then how to what should be reimbured and
 
then how to what should be reimbured and
what shouldn't. Yeah. So you have a lot
 
what shouldn't. Yeah. So you have a lot
more understanding of sort of all of the
 
more understanding of sort of all of the
plumbing that goes into building a a
 
plumbing that goes into building a a
company and of course like so many
 
company and of course like so many
learnings about h how you would do it
 
learnings about h how you would do it
differently the next time. Totally. I
 
differently the next time. Totally. I
was going to ask both of you is there is
 
was going to ask both of you is there is
there really a way to avoid that? I mean
 
there really a way to avoid that? I mean
can you even if you could should you
 
can you even if you could should you
outsource that stuff? I mean it's kind
 
outsource that stuff? I mean it's kind
of like your business your baby because
 
of like your business your baby because
I've heard people say oh I'm just going
 
I've heard people say oh I'm just going
to have someone set it all up and that
 
to have someone set it all up and that
scares me even more than doing it. I
 
scares me even more than doing it. I
think there's pieces to
 
think there's pieces to
outsource and then I think a lot of it
 
outsource and then I think a lot of it
that you I mean I think hiring somebody
 
that you I mean I think hiring somebody
who's like been there it's it's another
 
who's like been there it's it's another
one of those cases of like trying to
 
one of those cases of like trying to
figure out the right roles to make sure
 
figure out the right roles to make sure
somebody's been there done that so that
 
somebody's been there done that so that
they can help you see around corners and
 
they can help you see around corners and
then outsourcing some of the pieces you
 
then outsourcing some of the pieces you
know the finance and maybe payroll
 
know the finance and maybe payroll
things like that. Yeah, I mean I'm with
 
things like that. Yeah, I mean I'm with
you, Kelly. Like a lot of it you just
 
you, Kelly. Like a lot of it you just
have to get your hands dirty on to just
 
have to get your hands dirty on to just
understand how it works. Because if you
 
understand how it works. Because if you
don't understand how it works and you
 
don't understand how it works and you
immediately outsource it, you don't
 
immediately outsource it, you don't
actually know if you're getting an
 
actually know if you're getting an
improvement, if improvements exist, like
 
improvement, if improvements exist, like
where there's arbitrage to be had. The
 
where there's arbitrage to be had. The
other thing too is like when you do it,
 
other thing too is like when you do it,
it kind of brings this sense of like,
 
it kind of brings this sense of like,
you know, I'm I'm like building the
 
you know, I'm I'm like building the
house from the
 
house from the
foundation. And so like I I know like
 
foundation. And so like I I know like
you know for like my house like my house
 
you know for like my house like my house
was built in 1952. Like there's still
 
was built in 1952. Like there's still
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm figuring out after living here
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm figuring out after living here
for eight years versus like a house I
 
for eight years versus like a house I
built like I know exactly like where
 
built like I know exactly like where
this plumbing goes and where this gas
 
this plumbing goes and where this gas
line is. And so there's I think there's
 
line is. And so there's I think there's
a there's an upfront cost to doing it
 
a there's an upfront cost to doing it
but then over time like it pays back in
 
but then over time like it pays back in
the form of just knowledge. Annie I want
 
the form of just knowledge. Annie I want
to talk to you a little bit about the
 
to talk to you a little bit about the
outcome at Humo. So sadly it was
 
outcome at Humo. So sadly it was
unsuccessful. I think honestly in an era
 
unsuccessful. I think honestly in an era
of AI like maybe we have a different
 
of AI like maybe we have a different
outcome now if you guys were to start
 
outcome now if you guys were to start
the business
 
the business
today but you stayed for four
 
today but you stayed for four
years. Why did you stay for so long?
 
years. Why did you stay for so long?
Yeah, I will say I think it you know I I
 
Yeah, I will say I think it you know I I
wish it had it had started a couple
 
wish it had it had started a couple
years after it did because I do think it
 
years after it did because I do think it
would have stood a better chance. I
 
would have stood a better chance. I
stayed for a long time because mostly
 
stayed for a long time because mostly
because of the people like we built a
 
because of the people like we built a
really world-class wonderful team and
 
really world-class wonderful team and
there was also deep belief in what we
 
there was also deep belief in what we
were doing and you know still is like I
 
were doing and you know still is like I
think it's really important to sort of
 
think it's really important to sort of
focus on how we can drive the right
 
focus on how we can drive the right
behaviors at the right time across a
 
behaviors at the right time across a
company. So the the mission and and
 
company. So the the mission and and
vision were quite exciting. And then I
 
vision were quite exciting. And then I
also
 
also
just, you know, I I like to see things
 
just, you know, I I like to see things
through and really wanted to stick it
 
through and really wanted to stick it
through for the the people that that I
 
through for the the people that that I
was working with. One of my best
 
was working with. One of my best
friends, this guy reported to Door Dash,
 
friends, this guy reported to Door Dash,
his name's Andrew Monday.
 
his name's Andrew Monday.
Literally yesterday we were texting and
 
Literally yesterday we were texting and
he was like it's he's like I can't
 
he was like it's he's like I can't
believe how many of these successful
 
believe how many of these successful
companies are just so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up on the
 
companies are just so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up on the
inside and it got us on this thread
 
inside and it got us on this thread
talking about product market fit is more
 
talking about product market fit is more
important than
 
important than
people and I don't think actually people
 
people and I don't think actually people
talk about it like it's one of my
 
talk about it like it's one of my
learnings you know with continuum I
 
learnings you know with continuum I
actually feel the same way I think we
 
actually feel the same way I think we
had the best possible team to go after
 
had the best possible team to go after
the But sadly we were unsuccessful
 
the But sadly we were unsuccessful
because we didn't have product market
 
because we didn't have product market
fit. What's your view on that topic?
 
fit. What's your view on that topic?
Like do you think product market fit is
 
Like do you think product market fit is
more important than people? I don't know
 
more important than people? I don't know
if I want to say more important but at
 
if I want to say more important but at
least as important for sure. I think
 
least as important for sure. I think
like it's it's probably more important.
 
like it's it's probably more important.
You have to you must have that otherwise
 
You have to you must have that otherwise
you will not win, right? And so I think
 
you will not win, right? And so I think
you can assemble the best team in the
 
you can assemble the best team in the
world and if you're not building the
 
world and if you're not building the
right thing together, if you don't have
 
right thing together, if you don't have
the right focus, you're not shipping the
 
the right focus, you're not shipping the
right products, it doesn't actually
 
right products, it doesn't actually
matter. And so I think that is at an
 
matter. And so I think that is at an
early stage all that matters is that
 
early stage all that matters is that
you're executing and building and like
 
you're executing and building and like
testing new products so that you can so
 
testing new products so that you can so
you can get to product market fit and
 
you can get to product market fit and
spending you should focus on your
 
spending you should focus on your
people. You should make it a place they
 
people. You should make it a place they
want to be. Like all those things are
 
want to be. Like all those things are
true, but spending, you know, extra
 
true, but spending, you know, extra
cycles on building an amazing culture is
 
cycles on building an amazing culture is
probably not the right place to be
 
probably not the right place to be
spending your effort versus spending the
 
spending your effort versus spending the
the time to really hone in on like what
 
the time to really hone in on like what
are the goals? Are we shipping
 
are the goals? Are we shipping
correctly? Are we are we like on a race
 
correctly? Are we are we like on a race
towards the product market fit? Because
 
towards the product market fit? Because
then the culture follows from there. you
 
then the culture follows from there. you
know, people as you get more and
 
know, people as you get more and
more wins on your belt, people are more
 
more wins on your belt, people are more
and more excited to be there and you'll
 
and more excited to be there and you'll
you'll retain your best people. I've
 
you'll retain your best people. I've
worked at places where the product was
 
worked at places where the product was
like you had to have it. I mean, it just
 
like you had to have it. I mean, it just
it it was such a a gold mine of right
 
it it was such a a gold mine of right
thing, right place, right time,
 
thing, right place, right time,
incredibly sticky, incredibly good. You
 
incredibly sticky, incredibly good. You
just literally could not live without
 
just literally could not live without
it. And it didn't matter how
 
it. And it didn't matter how
dysfunctional the inside was. And
 
dysfunctional the inside was. And
believe me, it was capital
 
believe me, it was capital
D. It didn't matter. Now, do I think
 
D. It didn't matter. Now, do I think
that there's a ton of those? It's
 
that there's a ton of those? It's
probably not the norm. And do I think
 
probably not the norm. And do I think
that you can actually live like that
 
that you can actually live like that
forever? Like, you know, the the more
 
forever? Like, you know, the the more
bold that capital D becomes, I think
 
bold that capital D becomes, I think
that is TBD because a lot of these
 
that is TBD because a lot of these
places before that happens, they get
 
places before that happens, they get
acquired, which happened, or they go
 
acquired, which happened, or they go
public or or something happens. And so I
 
public or or something happens. And so I
I think it's that the jury's out on how
 
I think it's that the jury's out on how
long it can go. But I have a pretty
 
long it can go. But I have a pretty
strong point of view. I'd love for you
 
strong point of view. I'd love for you
guys to push back that a company can be
 
guys to push back that a company can be
successful if if the culture is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If
 
successful if if the culture is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If
the if the product is that good and a
 
the if the product is that good and a
company can't be successful if it's the
 
company can't be successful if it's the
best place to work in the world and it's
 
best place to work in the world and it's
not doing well. I mean, you might feel
 
not doing well. I mean, you might feel
good as you're like playing in the band
 
good as you're like playing in the band
when Titanic's going down, but it's
 
when Titanic's going down, but it's
going to go down. And that's hard for me
 
going to go down. And that's hard for me
to say because I hate
 
to say because I hate
that. I really do. It's true. But it
 
that. I really do. It's true. But it
really speaks to like there's a moment
 
really speaks to like there's a moment
in time where you must like pour the,
 
in time where you must like pour the,
you know, pour the gas onto the culture
 
you know, pour the gas onto the culture
and really building because then you can
 
and really building because then you can
like 10x from a really great spot. But
 
like 10x from a really great spot. But
doing that too early is you're you're
 
doing that too early is you're you're
not focusing on the right things. Yep.
 
not focusing on the right things. Yep.
It's the truth, Kelly. Like it's it's
 
It's the truth, Kelly. Like it's it's
crazy. And I don't think people talk
 
crazy. And I don't think people talk
about it much. like it's
 
about it much. like it's
so you know if you look on LinkedIn
 
so you know if you look on LinkedIn
right it's all about like the people and
 
right it's all about like the people and
the culture and like those things and
 
the culture and like those things and
people just don't really talk much about
 
people just don't really talk much about
the depth of product market fit and so I
 
the depth of product market fit and so I
think you know my feedback to people is
 
think you know my feedback to people is
like if you are like thinking about a
 
like if you are like thinking about a
career move the first thing is product
 
career move the first thing is product
market fit and the depth of it because
 
market fit and the depth of it because
everything else I like if you have that
 
everything else I like if you have that
figured out and the company succeeds
 
figured out and the company succeeds
right like that ends up solving So many
 
right like that ends up solving So many
of those secondorder problems like even
 
of those secondorder problems like even
your ability to attract great people is
 
your ability to attract great people is
solved by depth of product market fit
 
solved by depth of product market fit
and it goes back to like the theme of
 
and it goes back to like the theme of
this show Annie we've been joking for
 
this show Annie we've been joking for
almost two years now is like clarity of
 
almost two years now is like clarity of
identity like who who are you and what
 
identity like who who are you and what
are you optimizing for at that time and
 
are you optimizing for at that time and
just be clear about it if you're like
 
just be clear about it if you're like
hey this thing is a freaking rocket ship
 
hey this thing is a freaking rocket ship
it's got it's got the best pro it's got
 
it's got it's got the best pro it's got
making like it's got something's going
 
making like it's got something's going
to happen here and you're miserable and
 
to happen here and you're miserable and
it's a terrible face, but you're like,
 
it's a terrible face, but you're like,
I'm going to do this for a couple years
 
I'm going to do this for a couple years
because of X. I mean, I had a great
 
because of X. I mean, I had a great
outcome because of it. You live through
 
outcome because of it. You live through
hell and sometimes you're like, that was
 
hell and sometimes you're like, that was
worth it. And sometimes you're like, it
 
worth it. And sometimes you're like, it
wasn't worth it. But I tell you
 
wasn't worth it. But I tell you
something, like now old people like me,
 
something, like now old people like me,
I guess, that don't have to
 
I guess, that don't have to
like deal with that. The first thing we
 
like deal with that. The first thing we
say is, I'm not going to work for a
 
say is, I'm not going to work for a
place that's not great because I don't
 
place that's not great because I don't
have to anymore. And that's that's the
 
have to anymore. And that's that's the
truth of it, Nolan. And some people are
 
truth of it, Nolan. And some people are
like, I don't I can't do it. And other
 
like, I don't I can't do it. And other
people are like, I'm going to swallow
 
people are like, I'm going to swallow
this pill for a while because of this.
 
this pill for a while because of this.
It just it really is clarity of
 
It just it really is clarity of
identity. But that's the truth. That's
 
identity. But that's the truth. That's
earning your agency.
 
earning your agency.
Yeah. Yeah. Give give people the choice.
 
Yeah. Yeah. Give give people the choice.
You got to be really upfront in the
 
You got to be really upfront in the
recruiting process about what what sort
 
recruiting process about what what sort
of mess they're walking
 
of mess they're walking
into. I think one of the one of the
 
into. I think one of the one of the
biggest learnings for me has been really
 
biggest learnings for me has been really
identifying the right like managers and
 
identifying the right like managers and
leaders for the stage of company. You
 
leaders for the stage of company. You
actually want the leaders that are like,
 
actually want the leaders that are like,
"Okay, how are we going to ship product?
 
"Okay, how are we going to ship product?
How are we going to prioritize? Like,
 
How are we going to prioritize? Like,
I've done this before and that's the and
 
I've done this before and that's the and
like I'm going to roll up my sleeves and
 
like I'm going to roll up my sleeves and
get in the code and understand like all
 
get in the code and understand like all
the ins and outs." That's the hire for
 
the ins and outs." That's the hire for
the early stage because they're going to
 
the early stage because they're going to
be focused on the right things. Molly
 
be focused on the right things. Molly
Graham came on the show and said
 
Graham came on the show and said
something, you know, a couple years ago
 
something, you know, a couple years ago
as like my company was struggling that
 
as like my company was struggling that
like really hit me hard. She said, "When
 
like really hit me hard. She said, "When
a company is winning, it covers up so
 
a company is winning, it covers up so
many
 
many
problems." And that's definitely been
 
problems." And that's definitely been
true. And one of the things that I'm
 
true. And one of the things that I'm
really proud of is like we we managed to
 
really proud of is like we we managed to
like keep morale as high as I think it
 
like keep morale as high as I think it
could go when the company wasn't
 
could go when the company wasn't
winning. How did you guys think about
 
winning. How did you guys think about
that at Humu given that you were in a
 
that at Humu given that you were in a
similar situation? I mean, I think it
 
similar situation? I mean, I think it
was it because we built it from just
 
was it because we built it from just
from day one to be a place people really
 
from day one to be a place people really
wanted to work and you know, people
 
wanted to work and you know, people
really trusted each other, cared about
 
really trusted each other, cared about
each other. We were also going through
 
each other. We were also going through
co so I think people really came
 
co so I think people really came
together to support each other and
 
together to support each other and
people felt cared for and safe and so I
 
people felt cared for and safe and so I
think that was how people stayed and and
 
think that was how people stayed and and
why people stayed. Yeah. It's like I I
 
why people stayed. Yeah. It's like I I
found that transparency is is like the
 
found that transparency is is like the
best antidote even when it feels scary
 
best antidote even when it feels scary
like just being super real about like
 
like just being super real about like
because everyone can see the metrics,
 
because everyone can see the metrics,
right? It's like there's a scoreboard.
 
right? It's like there's a scoreboard.
Everyone sees the scoreboard. And so if
 
Everyone sees the scoreboard. And so if
you can't describe what's going on and
 
you can't describe what's going on and
if you're just trying to like constantly
 
if you're just trying to like constantly
offiscate or hide from it, that is like
 
offiscate or hide from it, that is like
the fastest way to trust a destruction
 
the fastest way to trust a destruction
versus like if you're talking about it
 
versus like if you're talking about it
saying like, "Hey, we tried these
 
saying like, "Hey, we tried these
experiments. These experiments failed.
 
experiments. These experiments failed.
Here's why they failed. Here's our next
 
Here's why they failed. Here's our next

I was just talking to someone about
 
I was just talking to someone about
this last week. I mean, and you know,
 
this last week. I mean, and you know,
companies that that fail aren't like one
 
companies that that fail aren't like one
in a million anymore. It's almost like a
 
in a million anymore. It's almost like a
notch in your belt to start something
 
notch in your belt to start something
and have to go through it. I mean, we
 
and have to go through it. I mean, we
talked about your journey, Nolan. And a
 
talked about your journey, Nolan. And a
lot of folks, you know, bring people
 
lot of folks, you know, bring people
they trust into these smaller companies.
 
they trust into these smaller companies.
Like, if you're going to put your
 
Like, if you're going to put your
everything on the line, you're going to
 
everything on the line, you're going to
bring the people that you trust that you
 
bring the people that you trust that you
know. So, a lot of these folks are not
 
know. So, a lot of these folks are not
like strangers that have applied. And
 
like strangers that have applied. And
that's even more so reason I told this
 
that's even more so reason I told this
person to be honest because there are
 
person to be honest because there are
people that have trusted you and they're
 
people that have trusted you and they're
people that maybe you'll do it again
 
people that maybe you'll do it again
with them in the future and and that's
 
with them in the future and and that's
going to be a really important, you
 
going to be a really important, you
know, decision for them whether you're
 
know, decision for them whether you're
successful or not is if you're you're
 
successful or not is if you're you're
open or not. It's hard to do it though.
 
open or not. It's hard to do it though.
Like it feels really scary in the moment
 
Like it feels really scary in the moment
to like bear the things that you know
 
to like bear the things that you know
that are your deepest darkest thoughts.
 
that are your deepest darkest thoughts.
And every time that I've like got to
 
And every time that I've like got to
that decision point and was like, "Okay,
 
that decision point and was like, "Okay,
I cannot say this thing or say I always
 
I cannot say this thing or say I always
defer like I always defer to say the
 
defer like I always defer to say the
thing." And it's amazing like the
 
thing." And it's amazing like the
reciprocation you get from humans. Like
 
reciprocation you get from humans. Like
it's just like life isn't up and to the
 
it's just like life isn't up and to the
right. Like it's it's life, it's
 
right. Like it's it's life, it's
business, it's relationships. And so
 
business, it's relationships. And so
just I think in general the biggest
 
just I think in general the biggest
lesson for me like struggling through
 
lesson for me like struggling through
that period was just like just be real
 
that period was just like just be real
and people will be real with you. And it
 
and people will be real with you. And it
is hard because the fear they had it's
 
is hard because the fear they had it's
not they were trying to like do bad
 
not they were trying to like do bad
things but the fear was
 
things but the fear was
that you know the the fire will stop
 
that you know the the fire will stop
like folks will just stop fighting and
 
like folks will just stop fighting and
go into preservation mode or kind of
 
go into preservation mode or kind of
give up which makes sense too. So, it's
 
give up which makes sense too. So, it's
a hard thing, but it wasn't anything,
 
a hard thing, but it wasn't anything,
you know, bad intent. It was just, hey,
 
you know, bad intent. It was just, hey,
these engines are going to shut down now
 
these engines are going to shut down now
versus keep going. That was that
 
versus keep going. That was that
definitely was not my experience. Like,
 
definitely was not my experience. Like,
you know, with with our team, I think
 
you know, with with our team, I think
it's a fair fear to have, but I don't
 
it's a fair fear to have, but I don't
think it's realistic. I think when you
 
think it's realistic. I think when you
like when you are honest with people and
 
like when you are honest with people and
you tell them what's up, but but you
 
you tell them what's up, but but you
can't do that without a plan moving
 
can't do that without a plan moving
forward. Right. Right. If you have no
 
forward. Right. Right. If you have no
plan moving forward, then yeah, like you
 
plan moving forward, then yeah, like you
shouldn't say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] until you figure that
 
shouldn't say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] until you figure that
out because people are going to be like,
 
out because people are going to be like,
"Okay, now what?" Like that is your job
 
"Okay, now what?" Like that is your job
as a leader. And and Annie, just
 
as a leader. And and Annie, just
oscillating back to Llo, what was the
 
oscillating back to Llo, what was the
best lesson you learned from working
 
best lesson you learned from working
with him? I think the best the best
 
with him? I think the best the best
lesson is probably Lzlo is amazing at pe
 
lesson is probably Lzlo is amazing at pe
putting people into roles that are are a
 
putting people into roles that are are a
huge stretch for them and just like
 
huge stretch for them and just like
hiring amazing people and then letting
 
hiring amazing people and then letting
them have a job or you know a a scope
 
them have a job or you know a a scope
that is way bigger than anybody else
 
that is way bigger than anybody else
would have thought was possible and then
 
would have thought was possible and then
watching them succeed and thrive and of
 
watching them succeed and thrive and of
course being there to to help support if
 
course being there to to help support if
they need it. So that's been huge for me
 
they need it. So that's been huge for me
is just like hire really amazing people
 
is just like hire really amazing people
and then you know throw them in the deep
 
and then you know throw them in the deep
end and be standing by if they need you
 
end and be standing by if they need you
but people will always surprise you.
 
but people will always surprise you.
That's really that's like counter to
 
That's really that's like counter to
what I would like he has access
 
what I would like he has access
to like the best talent in the world,
 
to like the best talent in the world,
right? Like basically everyone knows who
 
right? Like basically everyone knows who
he is. Like his the book is like
 
he is. Like his the book is like
somewhere behind me. Like this dude's
 
somewhere behind me. Like this dude's
super famous. And what you're saying is
 
super famous. And what you're saying is
kind of counter because like he could
 
kind of counter because like he could
pick up the phone and call the world's
 
pick up the phone and call the world's
expert and have them come and solve that
 
expert and have them come and solve that
problem. But like even Llo is like
 
problem. But like even Llo is like
actually like let's go let this like
 
actually like let's go let this like
high potential even though they may have
 
high potential even though they may have
never figured it out before like go
 
never figured it out before like go
figure out this problem. Like you saw
 
figure out this problem. Like you saw
him do that pretty often. Totally. Yeah.
 
him do that pretty often. Totally. Yeah.
And he all about you know just put
 
And he all about you know just put
elevating people you know from within
 
elevating people you know from within
and and he really really believed in
 
and and he really really believed in
people which helps them believe in
 
people which helps them believe in
themselves. Yeah. You see a lot of
 
themselves. Yeah. You see a lot of
leaders who kind of make somebody really
 
leaders who kind of make somebody really
prove it before they can like take a
 
prove it before they can like take a
step up opportunity. Lazo gives the step
 
step up opportunity. Lazo gives the step
up opportunity to people who he who he
 
up opportunity to people who he who he
feels can really thrive in that role. I
 
feels can really thrive in that role. I
love that. I so subscribe to that
 
love that. I so subscribe to that
methodology. Let's talk about your
 
methodology. Let's talk about your
 
VC, I I think that every venture-backed
 
VC, I I think that every venture-backed
people leader I've ever known has at
 
people leader I've ever known has at
least had the
 
least had the
thought about working in VC. And usually
 
thought about working in VC. And usually
it's like this big like glorified like
 
it's like this big like glorified like
oh yeah like when I like you know that
 
oh yeah like when I like you know that
they all have this like amazing job and
 
they all have this like amazing job and
it's so much better on the other side of
 
it's so much better on the other side of
the table. You did it for two years but
 
the table. You did it for two years but
now you're back in the operating seat.
 
now you're back in the operating seat.
Is working in VC overrated? I don't
 
Is working in VC overrated? I don't
think it's necessarily overrated. I
 
think it's necessarily overrated. I
think the two things I'll say. One is
 
think the two things I'll say. One is
every venture firm is totally different
 
every venture firm is totally different
in how their operating team works. So
 
in how their operating team works. So
really understanding the role and and
 
really understanding the role and and
the VC is critical for people who are
 
the VC is critical for people who are
going to explore that. The the thing
 
going to explore that. The the thing
that wasn't for me is I just I really
 
that wasn't for me is I just I really
love being part of a team and building
 
love being part of a team and building
something together with other people
 
something together with other people
like driving towards a mission together.
 
like driving towards a mission together.
And that is missing on the VC side. You
 
And that is missing on the VC side. You
know, you're helping a lot of different
 
know, you're helping a lot of different
founders with their companies and giving
 
founders with their companies and giving
them advice and kind of tapping in and
 
them advice and kind of tapping in and
then tapping out which is fun and
 
then tapping out which is fun and
energizing.
 
energizing.
But I I really miss being part of
 
But I I really miss being part of
something bigger. Annie, are all
 
something bigger. Annie, are all
VCs equal in that respect? Because I get
 
VCs equal in that respect? Because I get
a lot of questions, hey, does it matter
 
a lot of questions, hey, does it matter
which one I go to? I just want to go to
 
which one I go to? I just want to go to
one. What's what are the differences?
 
one. What's what are the differences?
What should I ask about or look for?
 
What should I ask about or look for?
What would you say to folks that are
 
What would you say to folks that are
asking that question? I would say
 
asking that question? I would say
they're all completely different from my
 
they're all completely different from my
experience. And I was really lucky to
 
experience. And I was really lucky to
join. I I am biased, but I think they're
 
join. I I am biased, but I think they're
the best. You know, the team at 4Runner
 
the best. You know, the team at 4Runner
was amazing. I I really really have a
 
was amazing. I I really really have a
lot of respect for everybody there. It
 
lot of respect for everybody there. It
was so much fun to be part of that
 
was so much fun to be part of that
team. But and and they were I was the
 
team. But and and they were I was the
first person in this role at Forerunner.
 
first person in this role at Forerunner.
So, it was about sort of shaping what
 
So, it was about sort of shaping what
that looks like for 4Runner and
 
that looks like for 4Runner and
understanding what the founders wanted
 
understanding what the founders wanted
and needed and building, you know,
 
and needed and building, you know,
networks for for the venture partners.
 
networks for for the venture partners.
At some firms it's all about like you
 
At some firms it's all about like you
know they the venture partners promise
 
know they the venture partners promise
they have different promises that they
 
they have different promises that they
make to the founders and some of them
 
make to the founders and some of them
you know you can have x number of hires
 
you know you can have x number of hires
or you they'll support them on the
 
or you they'll support them on the
executive searches. So it's it's a
 
executive searches. So it's it's a
completely different role depending on
 
completely different role depending on
the venture firm. What was the role like
 
the venture firm. What was the role like
how did you guys do it at 4Runner? Was
 
how did you guys do it at 4Runner? Was
it like a teach them how to fish model
 
it like a teach them how to fish model
or were you guys act actively providing
 
or were you guys act actively providing
services to the portfolio companies?
 
services to the portfolio companies?
Teach you how to fish. And what do you
 
Teach you how to fish. And what do you
think about that model? Like what what
 
think about that model? Like what what
is what is your view? That one worked.
 
is what is your view? That one worked.
So at the bigger firms where they have
 
So at the bigger firms where they have
big talent teams, you know, you can
 
big talent teams, you know, you can
structure it differently and you know,
 
structure it differently and you know,
each talent partner is sort of focused
 
each talent partner is sort of focused
on a different vertical building
 
on a different vertical building
networks for for the portfolio for
 
networks for for the portfolio for
example. But at 4Runner, it was just me.
 
example. But at 4Runner, it was just me.
And so it was all about like identify
 
And so it was all about like identify
sort of the the key things that our all
 
sort of the the key things that our all
of our founders should know and do lunch
 
of our founders should know and do lunch
and learns on those or you know do a
 
and learns on those or you know do a
speaking session and then identify sort
 
speaking session and then identify sort
of our earliest new investments who we
 
of our earliest new investments who we
put a lot of money into and spend some
 
put a lot of money into and spend some
you know white glove time with those
 
you know white glove time with those
founders or with the first people person
 
founders or with the first people person
that they bring on and and mentor those
 
that they bring on and and mentor those
folks so that they can learn how to do
 
folks so that they can learn how to do
this. And then it was also about like
 
this. And then it was also about like
building networks of founders so that
 
building networks of founders so that
they can learn from each other as well
 
they can learn from each other as well
and sort of founders of things. Oh,
 
and sort of founders of things. Oh,
interesting. Inside the portfolio.
 
interesting. Inside the portfolio.
Yeah. Got it. And I I also often
 
Yeah. Got it. And I I also often
connected people leaders within the
 
connected people leaders within the
portfolio so they could learn from each
 
portfolio so they could learn from each
other as well. Cool. And like I've
 
other as well. Cool. And like I've
talked to a few over the past, you know,
 
talked to a few over the past, you know,
a handful over the past year or so about
 
a handful over the past year or so about
maybe joining. Like what do you ask
 
maybe joining. Like what do you ask
Annie? What would you what wisdom would
 
Annie? What would you what wisdom would
you share for those listening that may
 
you share for those listening that may
be assessing whether it's a great VC
 
be assessing whether it's a great VC
like 4ERunner or a terrible place where
 
like 4ERunner or a terrible place where
they're going to want to run out? Like
 
they're going to want to run out? Like
how do you sus that out? What do you
 
how do you sus that out? What do you
ask? What do you dive into? I mean, I
 
ask? What do you dive into? I mean, I
would definitely look for who's done the
 
would definitely look for who's done the
role or in operating role at that VC
 
role or in operating role at that VC
prior. So scour LinkedIn for prior
 
prior. So scour LinkedIn for prior
people to like back channel. So, I would
 
people to like back channel. So, I would
imagine somebody taking a role at
 
imagine somebody taking a role at
 
me. I think also making sure that you
 
me. I think also making sure that you
talk to the other people on the team.
 
talk to the other people on the team.
So, if you're joining an A16Z, you know,
 
So, if you're joining an A16Z, you know,
try to make sure you're talking with the
 
try to make sure you're talking with the
other people in the talent role to
 
other people in the talent role to
really understand the ins and outs of
 
really understand the ins and outs of
what they're doing and make sure that
 
what they're doing and make sure that
that role is what you actually want to
 
that role is what you actually want to
do. I think another thing to ask is
 
do. I think another thing to ask is
which partner you'll be working
 
which partner you'll be working
with or if you'll be working with all
 
with or if you'll be working with all
the partners because if you're working
 
the partners because if you're working
with many partners you then have a lot
 
with many partners you then have a lot
of different sort of bosses who think
 
of different sort of bosses who think
about the role very differently and so
 
about the role very differently and so
trying to scratch under what that
 
trying to scratch under what that
actually will look like. So one partner
 
actually will look like. So one partner
might think of you as like a resource to
 
might think of you as like a resource to
just like go to when you need to hire a
 
just like go to when you need to hire a
head of marketing and so you need to
 
head of marketing and so you need to
like build out your network of
 
like build out your network of
recruiters for that. Another might come
 
recruiters for that. Another might come
to you with strategic HR questions. But
 
to you with strategic HR questions. But
really getting to understand that is
 
really getting to understand that is
helpful. Yeah. And just selfishly, this
 
helpful. Yeah. And just selfishly, this
wasn't on the, you know, we didn't talk
 
wasn't on the, you know, we didn't talk
about this,
 
about this,
but like how do you get smart on the the
 
but like how do you get smart on the the
dollar side of things? Like I'll be
 
dollar side of things? Like I'll be
honest, like I'm trying to get smarter
 
honest, like I'm trying to get smarter
at this and I'm pretty savvy already,
 
at this and I'm pretty savvy already,
but like when I'm talking to VCs, we
 
but like when I'm talking to VCs, we
talk about the fund and the carry and
 
talk about the fund and the carry and
how that all works as far as kind of
 
how that all works as far as kind of
like your equity and in in the the
 
like your equity and in in the the
portfolio, if you will. Like how do you
 
portfolio, if you will. Like how do you
talk about that or what questions are
 
talk about that or what questions are
good to ask to understand how that
 
good to ask to understand how that
works? Yeah. I I mean, I think asking
 
works? Yeah. I I mean, I think asking
how many dollars are at
 
how many dollars are at
play with the carry is probably the most
 
play with the carry is probably the most
important thing. I I've never heard
 
important thing. I I've never heard
that. That's incred. I don't even know
 
that. That's incred. I don't even know
what that means. So, can you tell what
 
what that means. So, can you tell what
that means? Yeah. Well, well, it's I I
 
that means? Yeah. Well, well, it's I I
don't really either, but I you there
 
don't really either, but I you there
anybody on the finance side at the VC
 
anybody on the finance side at the VC
fund should be able to explain like if
 
fund should be able to explain like if
you're getting, you know, whatever
 
you're getting, you know, whatever
amount of carry you're getting, they
 
amount of carry you're getting, they
should be able to tell you how much at a
 
should be able to tell you how much at a
base is at play with that amount of
 
base is at play with that amount of
carry. So, like if the fund returns,
 
carry. So, like if the fund returns,
this is how much money you'll get. If
 
this is how much money you'll get. If
the fund 10xes, here's what that will
 
the fund 10xes, here's what that will
look like. Oh, I like that. It's about
 
look like. Oh, I like that. It's about
playing the scenarios like you would,
 
playing the scenarios like you would,
you know, with with venture money as or
 
you know, with with venture money as or
like equity. I love that. I think that
 
like equity. I love that. I think that
that's a big takeway that I'm going to
 
that's a big takeway that I'm going to
start actively getting trying to get
 
start actively getting trying to get
better at is real smart around how that
 
better at is real smart around how that
works. Yeah, scenario planning for
 
works. Yeah, scenario planning for
Carrie is is not something I thought
 
Carrie is is not something I thought
about. I was actually just about to
 
about. I was actually just about to
mention. So, I'm I'm advising Day One
 
mention. So, I'm I'm advising Day One
Ventures right now. And Kelly, to your
 
Ventures right now. And Kelly, to your
point, I was a founder. I was a chief
 
point, I was a founder. I was a chief
people officer. Like I know a lot of
 
people officer. Like I know a lot of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like I've seen a lot of these
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like I've seen a lot of these
situations. And it amazes me that I'm
 
situations. And it amazes me that I'm
learning something new like every two
 
learning something new like every two
weeks. And and just like a a couple of
 
weeks. And and just like a a couple of
rules of thumb for me that's been super
 
rules of thumb for me that's been super
helpful is like I ask the dumb question.
 
helpful is like I ask the dumb question.
And you know, some I won't do it with
 
And you know, some I won't do it with
like the GP in the room cuz like I don't
 
like the GP in the room cuz like I don't
want to waste her time, but like I I'll
 
want to waste her time, but like I I'll
do it with shout out to my boy Hunter
 
do it with shout out to my boy Hunter
who leads legal and finance and I'll
 
who leads legal and finance and I'll
just be like Hunter like please explain
 
just be like Hunter like please explain
this to me like I'm five. Like what is
 
this to me like I'm five. Like what is
going on with this thing? And there's a
 
going on with this thing? And there's a
lot of like one of my biggest learnings
 
lot of like one of my biggest learnings
with Carrie is that it actually it it
 
with Carrie is that it actually it it
pays out right when there is a
 
pays out right when there is a
liquidation event. And I didn't I didn't
 
liquidation event. And I didn't I didn't
actually know that. I thought like oh
 
actually know that. I thought like oh
the fund closes and then at the end of
 
the fund closes and then at the end of
the fund like that's when everything
 
the fund like that's when everything
gets distributed. Like distributions
 
gets distributed. Like distributions
happen as companies are acquired in real
 
happen as companies are acquired in real
time. And so the math is like it's
 
time. And so the math is like it's
literally moving around in real time
 
literally moving around in real time
which is very challenging when people
 
which is very challenging when people
start like especially for new hires
 
start like especially for new hires
starting as like a fund has already like
 
starting as like a fund has already like
taken off because like that math is
 
taken off because like that math is
actually different for that person than
 
actually different for that person than
it was for the people who were there.
 
it was for the people who were there.
So, I'm I'm learning like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton
 
So, I'm I'm learning like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton
about this game, and I I can't believe
 
about this game, and I I can't believe
like how nuanced and bespoke it is.
 
like how nuanced and bespoke it is.
Importantly, before before you do get
 
Importantly, before before you do get
paid out, the the fund has to like hit
 
paid out, the the fund has to like hit
the payback. Yeah. It can take quite a
 
the payback. Yeah. It can take quite a
while. Yeah. You have to pay your LPs
 
while. Yeah. You have to pay your LPs
first. Yeah. Yeah. LPs get paid first
 
first. Yeah. Yeah. LPs get paid first
and then and then VCs get paid. Only if
 
and then and then VCs get paid. Only if
like they're making money on it. That's
 
like they're making money on it. That's
right. Yeah. I have a friend who's been
 
right. Yeah. I have a friend who's been
a venture partner for like eight years
 
a venture partner for like eight years
and hasn't seen any return yet. So, it
 
and hasn't seen any return yet. So, it
can be a very long game. Yeah, that
 
can be a very long game. Yeah, that
that's the that's actually it's a great
 
that's the that's actually it's a great
point, Andy, which is like the the other
 
point, Andy, which is like the the other
learning is the feedback loop is so
 
learning is the feedback loop is so
slow.
 
slow.
Like it's you know, it's even even
 
Like it's you know, it's even even
working for a VCback tech company, the
 
working for a VCback tech company, the
feedback loop is is often really really
 
feedback loop is is often really really
slow. But for venture funds, it's even
 
slow. But for venture funds, it's even
worse because like, you know, oftentimes
 
worse because like, you know, oftentimes
in order to return a fund, you either
 
in order to return a fund, you either
need a mega mega winner or multiple
 
need a mega mega winner or multiple
winners. And so for that to happen, it
 
winners. And so for that to happen, it
like time is it just takes
 
like time is it just takes
time. All right, Ann, let's talk about
 
time. All right, Ann, let's talk about
character. So, let me just kind of set
 
character. So, let me just kind of set
the scene for the audience and please
 
the scene for the audience and please
fill in any gaps that I have in in this
 
fill in any gaps that I have in in this
narrative. So you guys are just
 
narrative. So you guys are just
objectively on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy ride. In
 
objectively on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy ride. In
 
had raised 150 million bucks at a
 
had raised 150 million bucks at a
valuation north of a billion. Then in
 
valuation north of a billion. Then in
October of 24, Google reportedly
 
October of 24, Google reportedly
invested 2.7 billion in a reverse aqua
 
invested 2.7 billion in a reverse aqua
hire of the founders and 30 AI
 
hire of the founders and 30 AI
researchers.
 
researchers.
So, I've actually never heard of a deal
 
So, I've actually never heard of a deal
like this. And you know, there's a lot
 
like this. And you know, there's a lot
of media that's reporting the reason why
 
of media that's reporting the reason why
stuff like this is happening is
 
stuff like this is happening is
because the the prior SEC chair, Lena
 
because the the prior SEC chair, Lena
Khan, was not like very favorable to
 
Khan, was not like very favorable to
acquisitions. And so, this is a
 
acquisitions. And so, this is a
different way to
 
different way to
structure essentially like an
 
structure essentially like an
acquisition of
 
acquisition of
talent, but you guys are still operating
 
talent, but you guys are still operating
the company. So, the founders are no
 
the company. So, the founders are no
longer there. These 30 AI researchers
 
longer there. These 30 AI researchers
are no longer there. They're at Google
 
are no longer there. They're at Google
and you guys are still building, I
 
and you guys are still building, I
think, a really interesting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
think, a really interesting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
product. What has that been like for you
 
product. What has that been like for you
and the team? It's been wild. So, so
 
and the team? It's been wild. So, so
this happened, it happened in August and
 
this happened, it happened in August and
basically the the way I like to describe
 
basically the the way I like to describe
it is they took our pre-training folks
 
it is they took our pre-training folks
to Google, so all the folks that were
 
to Google, so all the folks that were
working on foundational models. So just
 
working on foundational models. So just
looking at it from a like academic
 
looking at it from a like academic
viewpoint, they kind of removed some of
 
viewpoint, they kind of removed some of
the noise because we had these two
 
the noise because we had these two
somewhat competing missions where we
 
somewhat competing missions where we
were going after AGI and building a
 
were going after AGI and building a
consumer product company and they
 
consumer product company and they
weren't always like going hand in hand.
 
weren't always like going hand in hand.
So or they weren't always like without
 
So or they weren't always like without
distraction, you know, and so they took
 
distraction, you know, and so they took
the the AGI focus to
 
the the AGI focus to
Google and it it you know and now we can
 
Google and it it you know and now we can
focus on building a consumer product
 
focus on building a consumer product
company and infusing sort of the like
 
company and infusing sort of the like
post-training AI and and data focus as
 
post-training AI and and data focus as
opposed to building foundational models
 
opposed to building foundational models
which is obviously very expensive and
 
which is obviously very expensive and
not our core business. So it was very
 
not our core business. So it was very
distracting though as any type of event
 
distracting though as any type of event
like that would be because a lot of
 
like that would be because a lot of
people joined the company to work with
 
people joined the company to work with
Gnome and to work with a lot of those
 
Gnome and to work with a lot of those
folks that that did go to
 
folks that that did go to
Google. But we we still have a real shot
 
Google. But we we still have a real shot
because we now again don't have that
 
because we now again don't have that
distraction and can rebuild as a
 
distraction and can rebuild as a
consumer product company. The thing that
 
consumer product company. The thing that
has been really tough
 
has been really tough
is we don't have a founder anymore and
 
is we don't have a founder anymore and
we weren't we have had never really
 
we weren't we have had never really
focused on having a product leader and
 
focused on having a product leader and
so until I think Erin joined us in
 
so until I think Erin joined us in
October we really didn't have a you know
 
October we really didn't have a you know
a product leader at all and so the we
 
a product leader at all and so the we
had a we we had and have been kind of
 
had a we we had and have been kind of
recouping a gap of product vision and
 
recouping a gap of product vision and
sort of the focus that the vision and
 
sort of the focus that the vision and
the mission that people need to be
 
the mission that people need to be
driving after. And so it's kind of what
 
driving after. And so it's kind of what
you said earlier, Nolan, where you're
 
you said earlier, Nolan, where you're
you're going to communicate this thing
 
you're going to communicate this thing
out and you need to tell people what
 
out and you need to tell people what
comes next. And so we did this deal and
 
comes next. And so we did this deal and
told people, great, now we're going to
 
told people, great, now we're going to
build a consumer product company or
 
build a consumer product company or
focus entirely on that, but didn't have
 
focus entirely on that, but didn't have
the like here's the exciting mission and
 
the like here's the exciting mission and
vision and like let's all charge
 
vision and like let's all charge
together. And so it's been a bit of
 
together. And so it's been a bit of
several months of us like building that
 
several months of us like building that
and we've come a long way and really
 
and we've come a long way and really
brought people along, but it's been a
 
brought people along, but it's been a
lot of work from a people's p
 
lot of work from a people's p
perspective. Can you walk me through
 
perspective. Can you walk me through
like when you found out and like your
 
like when you found out and like your
like what did you do? Like how did you
 
like what did you do? Like how did you
respond? What did you do? And then like
 
respond? What did you do? And then like
what was that companywide communication
 
what was that companywide communication
like? And and did it take a long time?
 
like? And and did it take a long time?
Was there a bunch of Yeah. waiting
 
Was there a bunch of Yeah. waiting
because when Looker went into Google, we
 
because when Looker went into Google, we
had like nine months of what we call it
 
had like nine months of what we call it
hell or no man's land or purgatory like
 
hell or no man's land or purgatory like
like how was that? So I started in mid
 
like how was that? So I started in mid
to late April. So I've been at Character
 
to late April. So I've been at Character
for almost almost a year now. Oh my god,
 
for almost almost a year now. Oh my god,
what a year. What a year. It's been
 
what a year. What a year. It's been
nuts. And then we these conversations
 
nuts. And then we these conversations
started in June. So, you know, I was
 
started in June. So, you know, I was
like getting all the like foundations
 
like getting all the like foundations
going for, you know, scaling the people
 
going for, you know, scaling the people
org and and then got pulled into this
 
org and and then got pulled into this
and I was kind of like, oh,
 
and I was kind of like, oh,
okay. And the the evolution of of what
 
okay. And the the evolution of of what
might what this might look like, you
 
might what this might look like, you
know, of course changed over the course
 
know, of course changed over the course
of two months, but it happened quite
 
of two months, but it happened quite
quickly to be honest. So it wasn't it
 
quickly to be honest. So it wasn't it
was hard on the people in that in that
 
was hard on the people in that in that
employees felt like all the leaders were
 
employees felt like all the leaders were
sort of in closed doors for you know a
 
sort of in closed doors for you know a
month and a half two months and then
 
month and a half two months and then
just got told okay of you know 30 of our
 
just got told okay of you know 30 of our
people plus Nome and Daniel are going
 
people plus Nome and Daniel are going
over to Google. So that from a comm's
 
over to Google. So that from a comm's
perspective was really hard for
 
perspective was really hard for
employees and people were also you know
 
employees and people were also you know
there was kind of different feelings.
 
there was kind of different feelings.
There were also people who are very
 
There were also people who are very
optimistic about our ability now to
 
optimistic about our ability now to
really focus on building a consumer
 
really focus on building a consumer
product company. Yeah. I mean you you
 
product company. Yeah. I mean you you
and you can't even tell like the because
 
and you can't even tell like the because
like this is a situation to where
 
like this is a situation to where
transparency is essentially not allowed,
 
transparency is essentially not allowed,
right? Like there's NDAs going on,
 
right? Like there's NDAs going on,
right? And so to the to the point around
 
right? And so to the to the point around
like employees felt like leadership was
 
like employees felt like leadership was
just in a conference room and not
 
just in a conference room and not
telling them anything, you actually
 
telling them anything, you actually
can't tell them anything, right? Yeah.
 
can't tell them anything, right? Yeah.
But you lose a lot of trust still and
 
But you lose a lot of trust still and
and like of course and rebuilding that
 
and like of course and rebuilding that
back is is hard. God that's so brutal.
 
back is is hard. God that's so brutal.
And so okay so then then you have like
 
And so okay so then then you have like
this all hands but this is it one of
 
this all hands but this is it one of
those situations Kelly like you were
 
those situations Kelly like you were
part of at Looker where it's like okay
 
part of at Looker where it's like okay
we have these all these conversations
 
we have these all these conversations
now we're all going we're all going
 
now we're all going we're all going
together. Yeah. Now it's now like
 
together. Yeah. Now it's now like
everyone's in the boat and here we go
 
everyone's in the boat and here we go
like to the new destination. This is
 
like to the new destination. This is
like some of us are going and the rest
 
like some of us are going and the rest
of us are staying. How many though? I
 
of us are staying. How many though? I
should know the exact number. So 30 went
 
should know the exact number. So 30 went
and probably like 60 or 70 stayed. Yeah,
 
and probably like 60 or 70 stayed. Yeah,
that's tough. And it's like the parents
 
that's tough. And it's like the parents
the parents are leaving with some of the
 
the parents are leaving with some of the
kids and the rest are not going. Like
 
kids and the rest are not going. Like
how do you say
 
how do you say
that? And and if I'm in a pool and I'm
 
that? And and if I'm in a pool and I'm
like who who did you pick? And and then
 
like who who did you pick? And and then
I'm thinking they picked the best people
 
I'm thinking they picked the best people
so I suck. No, it it wasn't that at all.
 
so I suck. No, it it wasn't that at all.
It was really the pre-training folks. So
 
It was really the pre-training folks. So
it was like very clear division of who's
 
it was like very clear division of who's
coming because it was all just the
 
coming because it was all just the
people who were working on pre-training
 
people who were working on pre-training
models. Yep. Okay. But a lot of those
 
models. Yep. Okay. But a lot of those
people were were individuals that you
 
people were were individuals that you
know our post-training folks were like
 
know our post-training folks were like
super excited to be mentored by and
 
super excited to be mentored by and
learn from. That makes sense. Okay. So
 
learn from. That makes sense. Okay. So
you I'm assuming we like have an all
 
you I'm assuming we like have an all
hands to where we communicate this and
 
hands to where we communicate this and
like the all hands is generally like the
 
like the all hands is generally like the
thing where it's like okay like this is
 
thing where it's like okay like this is
what we're doing this is what's
 
what we're doing this is what's
happening like I know this is a surprise
 
happening like I know this is a surprise
like this is the announcement but then I
 
like this is the announcement but then I
think what's more interesting is like
 
think what's more interesting is like
that next week like what happens in that
 
that next week like what happens in that
week and how do you reset those folks on
 
week and how do you reset those folks on
this go forward mission we actually we
 
this go forward mission we actually we
did an offsite so we had everybody go to
 
did an offsite so we had everybody go to
Napa together and spend two days just
 
Napa together and spend two days just
kind like talking it through, feeling
 
kind like talking it through, feeling
feelings, like asking questions and it
 
feelings, like asking questions and it
was it was good. I mean, I think a lot
 
was it was good. I mean, I think a lot
of people were still were like
 
of people were still were like
cautiously optimistic about the future,
 
cautiously optimistic about the future,
but feeling
 
but feeling
feelings and then and then we actually
 
feelings and then and then we actually
came back from that and did a hackathon
 
came back from that and did a hackathon
to like put all the energy into like,
 
to like put all the energy into like,
all right, let's build some stuff
 
all right, let's build some stuff
together. Let's like, you know, take
 
together. Let's like, you know, take
this energy of us all being together and
 
this energy of us all being together and
and really like crank on projects to see
 
and really like crank on projects to see
that we can execute to see what we can
 
that we can execute to see what we can
push forward on as far as the product
 
push forward on as far as the product
and really make it better. I love that.
 
and really make it better. I love that.
That's actually a great idea, especially
 
That's actually a great idea, especially
Napa to where it's like, hey, like let's
 
Napa to where it's like, hey, like let's
get a couple glasses of wine and like
 
get a couple glasses of wine and like
Yeah. like let's really like lower the
 
Yeah. like let's really like lower the
you know the the waterline on the
 
you know the the waterline on the
iceberg right now and talk about some
 
iceberg right now and talk about some
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know, versus especially with
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know, versus especially with
so many of these companies like being
 
so many of these companies like being
hybrid or at least, you know, in some of
 
hybrid or at least, you know, in some of
those senses like like you get people in
 
those senses like like you get people in
person, you get them in an off-site
 
person, you get them in an off-site
location like you can actually like have
 
location like you can actually like have
more of these conversations because
 
more of these conversations because
people are are more willing to be real
 
people are are more willing to be real
in those
 
in those
environments. That's a good idea. It
 
environments. That's a good idea. It
helped and I do think it
 
helped and I do think it
helped lower the bar to future
 
helped lower the bar to future
conversations too. So people really felt
 
conversations too. So people really felt
like okay doors open if I if I want to
 
like okay doors open if I if I want to
like give feedback and like talk about
 
like give feedback and like talk about
this thing or share you know what feels
 
this thing or share you know what feels
off and which which you know is really
 
off and which which you know is really
good and also can be a lot on the
 
good and also can be a lot on the
people's side. Yeah. So we we spent many
 
people's side. Yeah. So we we spent many
months, you know, working working people
 
months, you know, working working people
through what had happened. Yeah. And and
 
through what had happened. Yeah. And and
were you all concerned about the
 
were you all concerned about the
business continuity, Annie? How did you
 
business continuity, Annie? How did you
kind of plan for that and ensure
 
kind of plan for that and ensure
character was still on a good path?
 
character was still on a good path?
Yeah, as part of the deal, they worked
 
Yeah, as part of the deal, they worked
out sort of the a fancy way to help
 
out sort of the a fancy way to help
people who were at Character 1.0 know
 
people who were at Character 1.0 know
share in some of the benefits of the
 
share in some of the benefits of the
deal. And so, you know, everybody who
 
deal. And so, you know, everybody who
was there at deal time financially got
 
was there at deal time financially got
some benefit from it that that is
 
some benefit from it that that is
ongoing. And also, we we now are
 
ongoing. And also, we we now are
entirely employee owned. So, our cat
 
entirely employee owned. So, our cat
table was wiped. We paid everybody. And
 
table was wiped. We paid everybody. And
so, we got to re which is like, you
 
so, we got to re which is like, you
know, we we brought on comp consultants
 
know, we we brought on comp consultants
and lawyers who had 20 plus years of
 
and lawyers who had 20 plus years of
experience. They're like, I've never
 
experience. They're like, I've never
seen anything like this. And so
 
seen anything like this. And so
we recreated our cap table from scratch,
 
we recreated our cap table from scratch,
which allowed us and has allowed us to
 
which allowed us and has allowed us to
bring people in really good ownership
 
bring people in really good ownership
and and really feeling like they're
 
and and really feeling like they're
they're a true owner in the company,
 
they're a true owner in the company,
which has helped quite a lot. So does
 
which has helped quite a lot. So does
the in that model, does the company get
 
the in that model, does the company get
recapped? Like is it a whole new
 
recapped? Like is it a whole new
valuation than what was going on before?
 
valuation than what was going on before?
Yep.
 
Yep.
Damn, that that's so interesting because
 
Damn, that that's so interesting because
that actually makes it like much, you
 
that actually makes it like much, you
know, I could see a situation there to
 
know, I could see a situation there to
where if I'm an employee, right? Thing
 
where if I'm an employee, right? Thing
one is you're thinking about the
 
one is you're thinking about the
finances of the deal. So, you're getting
 
finances of the deal. So, you're getting
upside from that, then you're getting
 
upside from that, then you're getting
significant upside in a recapped company
 
significant upside in a recapped company
that is still like super hot and, you
 
that is still like super hot and, you
know, has product market fit and all the
 
know, has product market fit and all the
things that we were talking about at the
 
things that we were talking about at the
beginning of the
 
beginning of the
show that Yeah. Okay. Like that's
 
show that Yeah. Okay. Like that's
actually a really interestingly
 
actually a really interestingly
structured deal because you see it from
 
structured deal because you see it from
the outside and you're like these people
 
the outside and you're like these people
got screwed.
 
got screwed.
No, they didn't. Cool. Okay. And so talk
