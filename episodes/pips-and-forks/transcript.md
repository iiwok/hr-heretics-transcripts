are typically designed as a cya for the
 
are typically designed as a cya for the
company and you know most people do not
 
company and you know most people do not

the majority yeah I I love that answer I
also agree that it's and I was hoping
 
also agree that it's and I was hoping
you'd say that it's it's it's through
 
you'd say that it's it's it's through
context you know what I mean and you
 
context you know what I mean and you
know I was taking some notes on this
 
know I was taking some notes on this
before you know I'm a big fan of
 
before you know I'm a big fan of
analogies and I feel like everyone's
 
analogies and I feel like everyone's
focused on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pip like the
 
focused on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pip like the
conversation actually if you peel back
 
conversation actually if you peel back
the onion isn't about the PIP the PIP is
 
the onion isn't about the PIP the PIP is
like a car it depends on who's driving
 
like a car it depends on who's driving
it you know what I mean like and that's
 
it you know what I mean like and that's
something that I've learned in my career
 
something that I've learned in my career
is that like the a pip is not just a
 
is that like the a pip is not just a
thing that everyone uses the same way
 
thing that everyone uses the same way
everyone thinks about the same way even
 
everyone thinks about the same way even
in the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] company a pip can be
 
in the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] company a pip can be
driven differently so I think we should
 
driven differently so I think we should
start talking about the people that are
 
start talking about the people that are
have their hands on the wheel or the
 
have their hands on the wheel or the
form so to speak not the the like the
 
form so to speak not the the like the
the the mechanism itself because that's
 
the the mechanism itself because that's
what really makes or breaks these things
 
what really makes or breaks these things
to your point how David uses them in
 
to your point how David uses them in
this company very genuine I've seen and
 
this company very genuine I've seen and
been a part of companies that do not use
 
been a part of companies that do not use
it genuinely um and so I actually don't
 
it genuinely um and so I actually don't
care if you're going to use Pips or not
 
care if you're going to use Pips or not
but if you are make sure that it is
 
but if you are make sure that it is
genuine because we've talked about this
 
genuine because we've talked about this
a lot and I I think this could be
 
a lot and I I think this could be
controversial in a lot of companies
 
controversial in a lot of companies
these things are in place as a forcing
 
these things are in place as a forcing

introduce the PIP IT it does make
everyone feel defensive I'm telling you
 
everyone feel defensive I'm telling you
it changes the whole vibe it's like that
 
it changes the whole vibe it's like that
person that comes to the party and
 
person that comes to the party and
you're like ooo what just happened the
 
you're like ooo what just happened the
whole the whole energy like shifts and
 
whole the whole energy like shifts and
I've always worked this way like even
 
I've always worked this way like even
when it was a tough situation you just
 
when it was a tough situation you just
you look someone in the eye and you talk
 
you look someone in the eye and you talk
to them like a human to a human and you
 
to them like a human to a human and you
talk in in reasonable terms you don't
 
talk in in reasonable terms you don't
use a lot of jargon and people when they
 
use a lot of jargon and people when they
trust that they'll want to figure it out
 
trust that they'll want to figure it out
like no one likes to fight I mean
 
like no one likes to fight I mean
unreasonable people do but that will
 
unreasonable people do but that will

anyway what's your take on if someone
survives
 
survives
that how do you how do you feel like
 
that how do you how do you feel like
they're viewed moving forward in the
 
they're viewed moving forward in the
majority of companies yeah you know what
 
majority of companies yeah you know what
that's interesting and I have a
 
that's interesting and I have a
hypothesis here that I think it actually
 
hypothesis here that I think it actually

bigger companies to be honest like the
 
bigger companies to be honest like the
Fang type companies exactly you know
 
Fang type companies exactly you know

they move too fast people change too
much um there's a lot of blood
 
much um there's a lot of blood
transfusion in earlier stage companies
 
transfusion in earlier stage companies
like these big companies you know you
 
like these big companies you know you
get 100,000 people in a company and you
 
get 100,000 people in a company and you
don't know people anymore so all you do
 
don't know people anymore so all you do
is look in the system at this stranger
