what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment today we
have a segment from a listener and it's
from Carissa so here's the note to us
hey big fan in the Pod I listen every
week my company is noodling on the idea
of doing a bar raiser type of interview
to ensure we hold our standards high for
bringing in exceptional Talent as we
scale so their series D about 220
employees she has heard mixed reviews on
the bar raiser program in theory it's a
good idea to have a trusted Elite group
of interviewers who assess leadership
potential and look for other high agency
people and hire the brightest Hustlers
who will push the company
forward I would love to hear what y'all
have seen and done and hear an opinion
or or take on this one so a couple of
things on Amazon's bar rer program from
the website so the goal is to bring
objectivity and to interview Loops uh to
fuel Innovation at Amazon bar raisers
are nominated by their peers managers or
other bar raisers they then have a
training program there's 3600 of these
people and they have a couple of jobs as
an interviewer they evaluate candidates
against core competencies as a decision
driver they drive excellent group hiring
decisions through interview feedback
reference checking so on and so forth
and then they teach other bar risers so
Kelly what is your take on this this
phrase has been around for a long time I
think it's a very powerful term that I
think a lot of leaders like is what I
think uh and I think it comes with a lot
of baggage either positive or negative
based on people's experiences with it
what I think is that it's thrown around
a lot and it feels good to say we have a
bar raiser process because that feels
good we hire the elite we have this
thing and I think in a lot of cases it
is implemented really really poorly and
there's not a lot underneath the term
bar raiser and I think it could be very
confusing in
organizations so I'll be honest there's
a lot of folks that I've worked with and
kind of chatted to and they hear this
term a lot implement this I want this
implement this bar raiser and they kind
of roll their eyes just like what what
do you mean what do you want so I think
there's a lot of confusion out there and
if I finish this I think we should
Rebrand it I think we should figure out
what do we want to do and and call it
something different that's very clear
what it is okay so is your take then
that
the execution of it is actually okay but
the nomenclature is where there's
problems or like where do you land on
like actually how I guess let's talk
about how Amazon does it and then how
can app to their own so how Amazon does
it is I think it's like less than 5% of
the population they're all cross
functional interviewers and they're all
focused on
identifying uh I think it's like the 17
principles that Amazon has for
leadership so these people come into
interviews they're not part of the team
and they're making sure that these
people are better than 50% of the
population how do you feel about that
specific aspect of it I feel like
anything in any interview process things
can get away from you and bias can creep
in that's how I feel so I do like the
idea of having people in the
organization that can do this and add
value to interviewers key term being
objective third party not a part of the
team I do think the term can again get
away from people and be a little bit
abused misused if you will right like
let's talk about nominations right we
say that referrals are one of the
biggest ways to get non diverse or yeah
non-diverse candidates or Workforce into
the organization because you refer
people that are like yourself you're
nominating peers to be bar raisers it's
just it's hard because it can be very
monoculture very quickly because you're
nominating people that are like you
they're looking for the same things and
I think it could you just it could be
very very dangerous and get away from
you if you're not constantly watching it
and assessing it and curing it if that
makes sense and there's one quote here
it says the bar Rider interviews are the
toxic Flex that no one needs and I just
again I think that term bar raiser comes
with a lot of power a lot of veto power
and clout that can be misused and I just
think it has to be watched right like
when I was at hired we had values
interviewers we didn't use bar raiser we
had interviewers that are at all levels
of the
organization they were a small subset
yeah probably about 10% of the company
highly like trained we spent a lot of
time with them they understood how to
ask questions what to look for how to
dissect those things behavioral
interviewing then we just kept poking
them right we kept poking them and made
sure that they were extracting these
things and it was very clear what we
were doing we were trying to extract
behavioral answers based on values that
were very viscerally defined you can see
it you can touch it you can feel it and
again that's my point I just feel like
this term bar raiser is thrown around go
Implement a bar raiser interview and
there's not a lot underneath it so
whether you use the bar Razer term or
not I just really encourage people to
unpack it be able to viscerally Define
it smell it touch it feel it and explain
it and not just kind of throw what they
think are great Superstar performers
into veto Talent cool so um we tried
this at door Dash we y um the the first
idea of a name was uh Team brda so like
you know the brda water filter so like
you can filter to for top top talent and
then I think we ended on like team red
um and I think the idea of bar raiser
makes a ton of sense I think like the
execution is is where it gets really
messy and it's hard to get right and so
I'll tell you what we learned so um
essentially like what we were trying to
optimize for is very similar to Amazon
is like you know we wanted to have our
best people uh interviewing and like
basically serving as like a a gut check
especially as we were hyper growing so I
was there from 50 to 800 that happened
over three years you have to think about
when that when you're in hyper growth
you tend to hire people and then
immediately throw them in interviews and
they haven't been calibrated on like the
interview process and what great looks
like and what our bar is and so there
are uh there are real problems to solve
which we wanted bar riser to S and I'll
tell you where we landed on this the
problem was um number one you burn out
all of your best
people and and so if you only have 5% of
your population as bar raisers and they
have to be part of every interview Loop
um they get burned out really fast
because not only they're interviewing
now for their team which they have to
hire for already they're now
interviewing for everyone else's
team hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
Real Talk most Talent leaders haven't
yet cracked how to leverage AI for
Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metav view is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join forward-thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
Kora and check out metaview head over to

here's a crazy stat between hybrid and
Frontline employees about 80% don't
typically work in an office so it's no
surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun
that's where work Vivo zoom's employee
experience platform comes in if you've
ever recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive
accessible and mobile First Tool people
actually like using it which is why
companies like ryion a Dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shoutouts and live streams among
other features help Elevate the employee
experience like never before the result
dramatically better retention
productivity and most importantly
connectedness a greater sense of the
belonging we all crave at work whether
we sit at a desk or drive a truck make
work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection to work vivo.com to book a
demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics
 
say and so they're not even like doing
their core job um problem number two is
that like we like to use this term like
objective and I'm not sure like there is
objective interviewing um it's just like
it's all subjective and I think it's
like a little bit of like a joke um to
call it objective so I tend to agree
with you on that um and then you know
problem number three was is just like
that you're exactly right the nominating
process of who these people are how you
pick them how you continue to come it
just became a huge overhead so what we
did instead um is we did uh we invested
significantly into interviewer training
and um and we we really wanted to do
this by team and by function to make
sure that like at the very top of the
org that that person who was running
that org knew exactly what they wanted
and then the second order was we then
created an offer review process so uh it
would you know the recruiter and the
hire manager hire manager made the
decision want to hire then that approval
would go through the org leader then the
final approval would go through Tony who
is our CEO and that way it was like the
microscope was out like every single
aspect I we weren't burning people out
so you know going back to what you said
Kelly the thing I really agree with um
is what problem are you
solving like what is it that we are
solving for um is it to raise the bar is
it to like have our best people
interview and then are you okay with the
tradeoff if it's like hey we want our
best people as part of every interview
are you okay with them like not working
as much and doing real work and actually
just spending more time on interviews
that's a real trade-off and that's a
real discussion to make right it's
almost like it should be a full-time job
right like a SWAT team of folks that do
nothing but this uh right because we had
the same thing they were like could I
can't I can't do this I can't interview
six people today and also
sell yeah um you know we there were some
other things that came up of like well I
want to be compensated more for this
stuff and and like those are you know
those those things like always come up
um but I I think the job of either a
recruiting or an HR leader who either is
thinking about doing this or gets
pressure from a business leader to go
implement it is to walk through the
tradeoffs of a program like this and
then also to walk through the
Alternatives and so we've talked a
little bit about the tradeoffs but like
you know your best people are you okay
with them not actually doing IC work and
spending more time in interviews because
that's a that is the trade-off like they
will be spending more time interviewing
and I'm actually for for a little bit of
time I'm okay making that trade but then
to them if you go and ask those people
this is the other thing that happened
you know our best people weren't
motivated by interviewing more
candidates like they were motivated by
doing deep work and correct they and
they were getting pulled away from that
work yeah so um I just think it's about
a trade-off discussion and then
evaluating what else that could help us
solve this problem again at door Dash we
found that offer review in a
multi-layered off review ended up
solving our problem which was raising
the bar and ensuring everyone coming
through uh had like a a microscope on
their packet which Tony and the orgal
leader did a really good job of I think
that's a really good example because I I
think it's very easy to get tangled up
in this um and again it gets away from
you right it's very easy to get the
adrenaline rush we're going to do bar
raisers we're going to put our best
people in and for me I just go back to
First principles why are we doing this
I'm assuming because you want
objectivity balance and you want to
ensure you get the best folks perhaps
that's the best way to do that for your
company is not to just pick 10 bar
raisers and let them go wild maybe it's
a multi-threaded offer process maybe
it's right job shadowing and we talked
about right the work trials which I
don't like that term but there's other
ways to get at this and so I think
there's a lot of folks that hear about
this and they just like jump into bar
raiser and they get very swept up in it
and the other thing that I'll I'll say
is that and we talked about this I'll
use the parallel of not all star
individual contributors are good leaders
not all star performers are good
interviewers and again I just I think I
think there's a lot of folks where a lot
of high performers they have strong
points of view and I believe they have
an inate bias to want to hire people
that are like them not necessarily look
like them but they might act like them
they might have the same energy right
these high performers that they might
want to model after themselves and then
you get again more of a mono like a
homogeneous culture that way and I'm not
saying not to do it I just am saying you
have to be careful with it and monitor
and continue to talk about it like
anything you can't just say you're the
bar raisers go and talk to them twice a
year it has to literally be day in and
day out it's not really even train it's
like how can you imprint how to do this
on these folks because that's what
that's what Founders want like that's
what they're trying to do they're trying
to create 10 of them so they don't have
to interview everyone yeah and I'm
trying to think of like this slide you
know if I'm a recruiting leader
presenting this to my CEO who my CEO is
like go build the bar raiser program
right and so I would say like that you
know one slide is is like you know
potential benefits um and then the other
side is is like you know potential
downside tradeoffs and then it's like
what is the tradeoff uh like what you
know and then how do we potentially
manage that so you're Point around bias
which you've mentioned a couple of times
I think that's fair right it's like you
know if we only have you know white men
or if we only have uh early
employees right they're going to bias
towards people who either look like them
or like are kind of like so like in the
early employee example yeah like and if
we're scaling like they're not going to
know what good looks like at scale and
constantly curate um and and be
thoughtful but one of the things you
said Kelly was actually where I was
going to go with it is as part of the
diligence
for thinking about what program you're
going to roll out and what is right for
you I strongly encourage leaders to go
talk to the top
performers and to get their feedback so
instead of just saying hey we're doing
bar Riser like this is what we're doing
now actually just go to your best people
and say look we're scaling or whatever
your problem set is we want to hire more
people like you but we also care deeply
around you know diversity or whatever
your other goals are what do you think
we should do like how do we have more um
how do we have less false positives and
uh how do we hire more great people and
just like get the feedback from them
because if you take those sound bites
and include it in your diligence deck to
your CEO they're going to listen to you
a lot more to when you say oh well Emily
you know who is like literally the best
performer in the in the company said we
should test this thing CEO all of a
sudden ears Park up and they're like
well that I I love Emily we should
definitely listen to what she has to say
yeah I think I think that is a great
example of my last takeaway if you take
nothing away from this and your CEO says
I want a bar raiser program don't go too
slow but go a little slow to go fast and
the first slide for me isn't tradeoffs
the first slide is interview your CEO
and say
why why do you think we need this what
does it look like like if we had a great
bar raiser program what would be
happening every day exactly what is the
outut what again what can you see touch
and feel because I think a lot of folks
get trapped in CEO saying bar raiser and
they go and they do stuff and it either
breaks other stuff or the CEO is like
what is this crap so try to go a little
bit slow unpack it and then you could
kick ass later yeah and then you know in
a world in your CE CEO's like go do this
Kelly like I told you to go build a bar
raiser program like don't give me you
know Nolan's deck of outline I don't
give a about that like go run this
program what you should actually do is
start small right and we we've said this
a million times on this show but like
start small with an experiment either
within one team or one organization
right and you know go ball to the wall
to make it happen there yeah and then
take the learnings from that then go
back to the CEO and say hey we we did an
this is what you know everybody in
engineering said this is what we learned
this would be the next steps for how we
roll this out on a more broad base the
best way to check the go box and not
break everything at the same yeah time
well it's also the best way to not get
your head chopped off you know for the
the CEO who's like I told you to go do
bar raiser and now you're coming back to
me with a deck that says why we
shouldn't do bar Riser so are we
misaligned like am I not speaking the
same language as you because I've
certainly been involved in those
conversations 100% 100% you gotta spread
that needle different topic totally all
