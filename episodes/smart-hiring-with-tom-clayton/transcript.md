what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics Tom
Clayton you were a sequoia back CEO the
VP at house during the Heyday the cro at
bill.com you've been like on 20 boards
which is still like crazy for me to
process and now you're the COO at Peak
welcome to the show man thank you for
having me cool so in our prep call you
blew my mind with this you call it like
the employee attribute chart so can you
give our audience a quick download on
what this thing is why you do it and
then just share your screen and give us
the the
Insight yeah uh probably just to give a
little bit of context before I flash a
confusing screen up but it's it's
something I use specifically when I'm
hiring large numbers for the same role
so think in sales AES or bdrs or sdrs or
support reps or csms whenever you've got
uh a current role that you have to fill
and there's tens if not hundreds of them
try to get it down more to a science
than uh individual individual emotions
and who you like when you're
interviewing them and so what I I do and
you could do this when you're building
out a new team or you can do this when
you're coming in and evaluating the
current team and trying to scale it I I
look at titl seek sales for example and
I'll show you the example when I share
my screen of sales there's about 20
attributes that could be correlated to
success in a role when you're in a sales
role at the company uh some people
emotionally get attached to certain
attributes over others but the data
doesn't lie and so what I'll do is I'll
go and score those 20 attributes if I'm
working with a current team say we've
got 30 AES I'll have three different
sales managers score on each of those
different attributes on a scale from one
to five and the reason I have three
managers is because you know everyone
evaluates people differently and so to
get some of that noise out of the way
you have three different managers score
them and then you run a regression
analysis against the past either 6
months or 12 months of performance six
months works if it's a fairly linear
sales cycle you have a very seasonal
sales cycle you need to do 12
months and then always without a doubt
four or five of them come up very
correlated and everything else is just
noise and so you can focus your entire
recruiting effort on those four or five
attributes and really focusing on them
as opposed to Boiling the ocean and what
happens in most of these scenarios is
you really like someone you connect with
them and then you want to hire that
person but they're not always the best
or the best fit for the role or for the
company I'll share my screen here so so
as you do this so like just let me let
me play that back slightly differently
so what I'm hearing is is like these are
the 20 attributes that matter for a
specific role regardless of the company
then what you what you're saying is is
there's like four or five of these that
matter contextually for the company and
what you're doing is is then you know
the way you figure out those four to
five is you're looking back on the top
performers and then what you're doing is
saying like now we need to assess for
these very specifically in the interview
process is that right yes and it does
very I've done it in many companies both
companies I've been a part of them
companies I've helped advise or been on
the board of it varies by company and
that's the the sort of surprising
Insight now some of them are are quite
consistent so if you look at the list
here uh I would say grit and and work
ethic tend to always rise to the top for
sales specifically and then some always
are on the bottom and so one I I don't
see here industry
expertise uh that you know just some
specific examples at how we hired former
interior designers to be salespeople
thinking they could speak the same lingo
at Bill we hired former CPAs and
accountants thinking they could speak
the same lingo horrible sales people uh
and Industry expertise never is a
correlating factor to success uh and and
then some some are very company specific
so at how competitiveness was very high
at Bill it was not an attribute
correlated at all but then when we
acquired divy divy was very high on the
competitiv side and that that really
goes to the the culture you have and
that you've built and that's why not all
attributes are the same at all
companies one one thing to note is a lot
of people are like well this these are
too many questions to go by when you're
interviewing but that's why you have
questions or cues and you notice more
than half of these you can answer with
cu's where you don't even have to ask
them a question you know uh how
interested are they in the job or how
you know how much do they prep they you
can judge that based on the questions
they're asking you have they gone to
LinkedIn profile are they leaning in um
some examples here you know curiosity do
they ask a lot of questions are they
good questions are they naturally
curious about the business it's not like
you have to ask them are you a curious
person like you're not you're you're
going to get a canned answer out on that
and so a lot of them might try to answer
with cu's as opposed to questions that's
super interesting okay so if you're
listening and you're not watching on
video what we're looking at here is a
Google sheet uh that has three three
four columns so column one says
attribute uh two says description three
says QE or question uh and then four
says example questions or cues to
evaluate and so for example if we go
across on one of these like you have
coachability uh and then is the
candidate or how receptive is the
candidate to feedback that's a question
uh and then here's an example question
which is after the role play give the
candidate feedback and have them do it
again see how well they listen and
incorporate that feedback
correct okay so Tom talk to me about
this regression
analysis yeah so it's I mean it sounds
complicated but it it does it's it's
pretty straightforward it's you take the
scores and you correlate them to uh
sales performance in in this case uh brr
sdrs would be different it' be more
activity based performance and the ones
that are the most correlated to uh
success meaning a good track record
within the company are the ones that are
going to be higher obviously the the
greater your in is meaning the greater
number of 80s you have the the better
the data set is so when you're building
out a team it does take some Cycles to
get this right you don't get it right
with the first five reps you hire you
you need a bigger end and it'll change
over time too as the company evolves and
scales early days maybe you don't have
perfect product Market fit you're still
figuring things out it's a different
type of DNA you're going to need when
you're got strong product Market fit and
you're just uh scaling as fast as
possible it'll probably be a different
set of attributes Kelly have you ever
seen one of these
yeah I was going to ask you but how when
who did this did this come about has it
been static have you had to evolve it or
change it I mean I I love it you know I
we I think we see the different
variations of this I'd love just to hear
the story for folks on yeah I started
doing a variation of
this uh at house uh basically because we
were growing extremely fast I think it
was maybe 50 people when I join joed and
we scaled it to a couple thousand over
uh a few years and we just we needed to
grow really really fast I mean that was
a days of hyperscaling right and going
across many countries and you wanted to
get the the framework right before you
added you know we were doing five
countries at a time and you didn't want
to go and do 10 countries and realize
you got the formula wrong and so uh and
then I I read a book uh it's actually he
since become a friend a good guy guy
named Mark Rober he was the first uh C
or sales leader at HubSpot he's now
teaching sales at Myoma Lauder uh which
didn't have a sales class when I was
there I I started the sales Club just to
try to get uh HBS to recognize sales was
important to companies uh and he wrote
this great book called the sales
acceleration formula and a lot of what
he talks about and how he thinks about
it is very similar to what I was doing
so I you know I I learned a lot from
what he was doing and you know took some
of my uh thinking behind it and took
some of his thinking and uh and I've
evolved it you know I started just in
sales doing it but it works within
support it works within uh post sales
customer support it works basically
wherever you have a lot of roles that
are doing the same
job I I mean I I think we've all seen
different variations of this over the
years you know it's it's wonderful Tom
and I think you know my my view on this
if you look at the attributes a lot of
them
are hard to measure you know what I mean
they're subjective they're like these
human characteristics that are that are
magical when people just nail them but
they're very hard to Define assess even
explain sometimes and they're the kind
of thing where if you ask 10 people what
do you mean by this you'll get six or
seven different answers and that's why I
like it because you you have attempted
or maybe mastered I guess I mean how to
like make tangible these things and
unpack them that it's like culture right
how do you define that and make it in a
way that people can touch it and feel it
or values or whatever the thing that
that's always the hardest part so I
guess i' love for the audience to hear
and selfishly because we haven't talked
about this how did you do that because
the attributes in the left column are
one thing thing what I think is the gold
part of this which probably was a pain
in the ass was the questions to get to
the cues and to train others to realize
how to unpack that and judge it because
that's like the hardest part yeah 100
perc uh it is it is part of uh the
exercise so first there's when you're
evaluating a current team getting
everyone on the same page on what each
of those attributes mean so you have
some consistency when you're scoring
it's never perfect it's not
you're trying to bring a you're trying
to make it uh you're trying to make
something objective that is naturally
subjective right or something
quantitative that's qualitative and
that's it's imperfect but getting
everyone on the same Baseline helps and
then uh training those that are doing
the recruiting and the interviewing also
helps uh over time people people get it
and the other thing that I we can get
into later but when I recruiting I also
like to have a lot of interviews and
I've got a lot of reasons around that
because I think the more data points are
the better uh and it's not just the more
data points but it's also and this goes
back to very early in my career one of
my first jobs working at BCG I was
interviewing with BCG McKenzie and Bane
and they put you through like four
rounds of three case study interviews
each and you're prepping for these and
you go in them you don't know what to
expect and by the time you're doing the
the fourth round you're in their office
they're not visiting you on campus
and you know you go through the cycle of
working just so hard to try to get the
job that I remember driving back across
the bay bridge and getting a call from
BCG and saying we want to extend you an
offer like I want to accept on the spot
I worked so hard to get it and I didn't
care what the I didn't ask you know how
much the comp was I didn't ask what
office they were going to put me in I
asked nothing I just wanted to accept
and then not only when you do that not
only do people feel like they've earned
it and they're have a much higher
likelihood to accept but they're also a
much more committed employee because
they feel like they've earned it and
it's just a different mindset when they
start and so I know a lot of people
don't like long processes larger
companies you tend to also get it
becomes a really slow elongated process
you don't want that either but it is
nice to have people feel like they've
earned it like I've had offers where
I've interviewed with two or three
people and I feel like they didn't even
test me you get an offer and it's yeah I
just don't appreciate it the same way
yeah you have like an an emotional
investment already with that group of
people that's a really I I like that
take I mean when I was at Google we
instituted the the rule of four which
meant you couldn't have more than four
on-site interviews and the reason we did
that was because with people analytics
we looked at the data and said we don't
learn anything more after that that
actually turned out to not be true like
four people four people or four trips
four on-site interviews four different
interviewers 45 minutes long yeah yeah
and that's also only looking at half of
it you're only considering what you get
from those interviews not what the
employee gets too because the employee
feels like they've met more people
they've be they they have more points of
contact they get more comfortable
uh and people also s to let the guard
down over time too so you know the first
interview everyone's very stiff and
buttoned up and by the sixth or seventh
interview they'll drop an fbom because
they feel more comfortable totally I
actually found though too that you know
four interviews it's it feels like speed
dating on both
sides hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after award from our
sponsors I must admit I used to believe
that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR that is until my friend
Heather do who leads talented signal
fire told me to check out metav I got
into the product and was like Wow AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick metav viw is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metaview changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out metav head over to metav view.
Heretics to talk to one of Med's product
experts tell them that me and Kelly sent
you or you could just go to their
website and get started for free you'll
be up running and AI enabled in
minutes you know there's something to be
said about you know Expediting the
process um but I I just always found
that like that even though data may have
said that four interview like we don't
learn anything more Beyond four
interviews I always felt like but I
don't know like I'm learning something
about the person and they're learning
more about us to your point which I
think is a really good one that I hadn't
considered well I I'll just give you an
analogy you go out on a date do you feel
like you know as much about your now
significant other after four dates then
after 20 dates no I hate dating I I I've
never really done it so I yes I don't
know I I bet you're you're totally right
Tom but like you know so the other take
that Kelly and I have had is
interviewing is very
performative and job simulation when you
can do it is so much more effective so
what's your view on job simulation and
work trials and those sorts of things
yeah I mean where I've seen it be very
effective is well the case study example
within a BCG or McKenzie obviously is is
a good one but with sales you know we
always have a role play where they're
selling something you know some
companies I I have given them a download
on everything our product does and have
them sell it sometimes I prefer just to
have them sell what they're selling
today and walk me through it and see how
it goes and then always give them
feedback have them do it again and see
how coachable they are and how they
incorporate that feedback it's very
important in a sales role I think that
is the most valuable data point or
interview we do in the process
uh and it's usually later in the process
because there's usually two or three
people involved in that but I I think
it's great it's a lot more difficult
when you are hiring senior execs because
you know having them come to you and
having a
CMO walk first of all it could be
borderline insulting for a senior person
to say hey I'm gonna have you do this as
you would do as a CMO here when they've
been a CMO three times over right and so
you got to be a little sensitive to that
and it's also just hard like what case
study do you come up with for a CMO or a
cro it's you get a lot more from a
conversation but I think for more Junior
roles It's very effective have you seen
a good like work trial work simulation
thing for a senior go to market leader
no and I I'm actually not not in favor
of it because of I've just seen too many
people myself included get kind of
annoyed at it it's it's like if you you
want to know my domain expertise in a
certain area just ask me all the
questions you want and I've seen people
react the same way when when I'm
interviewing well when others have
interviewed them and and tried to do
that you know it's just more difficult
to do at a senior level yeah one of the
things we did at CA which was kind of
interesting it's
it's I don't I don't know how much data
you actually get but we actually invited
uh prospective execs towards the end of
the process to a couple of exec
meetings and they got to sit down and
actually listen to what was happening in
the exact room and then after the fact
we were able to like we were just like
what's your take what do you think and
just kind of doing it very open-ended
again I don't it gave some signal it's
not like the best right it's not like
they're like actually doing real work
but you could see how somebody thinks
you could see how somebody is like going
to or wants to take part in in the group
level discussion I actually did find
that kind of help
I I love that idea most Founders are a
little sensitive to they are bringing
Outsiders into that level of
discussion but I love the idea I know as
a candidate I would love it too because
it's a two-way street you're trying to
figure out if there's a good fit there
there's a bunch you don't know you know
just like a person interviewing is
putting on their best space the
company's doing the same thing right and
so by getting behind the a bit it's it's
helpful for the candidate as well yeah I
mean I most of my Venture jobs I
wouldn't take it unless I engaged in
that as a candidate usually followed by
like a dinner or something else um and I
just talked about it today with with
Quizlet like we're we're hiring a CMO
and I was like you got I think you got
to do this because at this level to your
point Tom it's not about hopefully it's
not about the functional or technical
expert
I mean if it is it's a whole another
session but it's Mo like what no we've
talked about this when cxo level highers
fail nine times out of 10 it's based on
chemistry philosophy
style fit um you know all all all those
things uh and I think you can sus that
out really well in like a mock exec
meeting you know and and have a
conversation so I think it's important
and if and if an exec
box at that I think we've also talked
about this Nolan that's a red flag
whether it's ego or this or that and
it's like I mean that they should never
B at that that's that's valuable for
them too totally like but I've I've seen
it some are like what how much longer is
this process and I've talked to six
people it's like have a nice day yeah no
that walk away from that that's that's a
huge red flag yeah but just to close out
the attributes really quick I think
again a lot of folks don't don't jump
into this pool because it's so hard like
where do I start how do I make these
intangibles tangible and I would say
even if you get it 30% right and you try
you're you're you're making things
better you know because to your point at
how's like two 50 to 2,000 people people
always ask how do I scale culture and
it's like I'm always like culture is
like a huge game of telephone and I
believe that the best cultures scale
well the more successful you can make
that game a telephone so how can you and
usually that's tied to making
intangibles very clear and like more
tangible so that maybe eight out of 10
people say it the same way versus like
three out of 10 before so I think it's
really cool trying to trying to make
that real and scale that out yeah and it
evolves over time right maybe you're 30%
accurate in the beginning you get the
 
headed in the right direction yeah and
there is no such thing as Perfection
right like it's just it's always a work
in progress but in the absence of that
what happens you're a Founder we've
talked about it Nolan you are terrified
to let anyone else judge this stuff so
you have to interview every single
person and then we we know what happens
from there yeah all right Tom I want to
talk about team building and you had
mentioned this also on our prep call of
just the importance for you and you
would mention some interesting
activities like doing your own Outreach
right so like what are what are the
activities that you do to build
worldclass teams yeah when it's a a
direct report for sure even key hires a
layer or two down I I like to be very
involved so I'll do first my own
Outreach to my network you know if I'm
hiring someone a CMO or cro I'll go and
reach out to the best CMOS cro I know
and you know maybe there's a little
probing them to see if they're
interested but also birds of a feather
flock together and say I'll ask them not
who they would recommend but who's the
best they've ever worked with because
they're not always shooting as high as
you're shooting right they're thinking
about who's available I'm thinking about
who could be available and so and then
I'll talk to them and it's just a
network of conversations trying to
figure out who could be good candidates
um I always reach out myself directly
obviously there's a a warm intro that's
great but I'll I'll reach out cold the I
found that the conversion rate or the
response rate is just significantly
higher than having a recruiter reach out
on my behalf you know Everyone likes to
feel flattered I noticed it with my
brother he he was at Apple back in the
day and he was running Finance for first
the the iPhone then the iPad and then
the iatch and he was you know Apple you
get very
sheltered and he got this email one day
maybe one of the first emails he got
from a recruiter because he was so
enclosed within the Apple
uh realm and it was from a tier four VC
saying they wanted to recruit him as a a
venture partner operating partner
something like that and he's like hey
what do you think should I consider this
and I'm like well you could do so much
better than this like if you really want
to leave Apple then do a proactive
search and I can help you with it but
don't just take something because you
feel flattered because they reached out
but I use that to my advantage all the
time I also there's times where I've had
to get extreme ex creative hiring
especially when I'm hiring areas where I
have no background or expertise so when
we're building out house you know
there's 20 plus countries and we had to
hire an editorial function with a full
editorial staff to write about Home and
Gardens and interior design and
architecture I don't have any background
in this right and so the team and I we
got creative in every country we would
go to the magazine store we'd buy
architectural digest Home and Gardens
interior magazines like a dozen
magazines flip a few pages they have a
page with all the editors and authors on
it start reaching out to them on
LinkedIn and ask to grab a coffee and I
was blown away at how receptive they
were not just having coffee but they all
wanted to leave because they were in a
dying industry and they all wanted to
come to house and so we got the crilla
CRM of editors in the by country just by
being creative um
I a few others that I serve rules I live
by and I don't know if I'm allowed to
say this but don't be a brand uh a
lot of people really focus on certain
brands like oh I want salespeople so I'm
going to go look at Salesforce or you
know back in the day it was Oracle the
the reality is some of the best
employees I've hired are from companies
I had never even heard of before and
sometimes they great companies I just
don't know the whole world of all the
companies out there but at the same
time people that join a company after
it's got strong product Market fit it's
scaled the operation is mature is very
different than the people in the
beginning and typically I'm hiring for
high growth startups and you need people
that can figure things out and be very
malleable and adapt and just be Hustlers
and be Scrappy and you're not going to
typically get that when you're hiring
based on Brands and where someone's
worked at a later stage in that company
don't be a brand I'm I'm
definitely going to steal uh you would
also mention something about your
current CEO like showing up on a
vacation you were at yeah so in general
a lot
of what influences recruiting I've done
is how people have also recruited me the
most recent one ruana uh our CEO founder
you know we were talking for a few
months and she had flown out a couple
times we spent a lot of time together
and for me
at at my stage of my career that
personal connection and culture fits the
most important if you're not having fun
what you're doing you're you're a it's
going to be miserable then B you you
likely won't be
successful and I was flying to Thailand
for Christmas break with my daughters
and she just happened to be going on
vacation and she's like well I'll go to
Thailand too and we met up in an island
uh we were in puket and we spent the day
together it actually my birthday it was
December 23rd spent the day together on
the beach having lunch um chatting about
the business her vision my thoughts just
going through a lot of stuff and getting
to know each other personally and it was
great and that you know I was already
leaning in but that put me over the top
like someone's going to fly out to to
Thailand you know she was going there on
vacation but still it's it just shows
how committed she was to the partnership
and and how she viewed me and I knew
that I was going to be given an
environment where I could be successful
there's probably a couple other
examples like that you know the BCG one
is one where I I've learned something
from one when I was coming out of
business
school IBM was trying to recruit me and
the the chief sales officer for the the
software division uh it was in his group
and I was on vacation for the weekend in
DC I was at one of the
museums and I got a call from him and it
was like on a Saturday and started
talking to him in the museum and it was
like an hourlong conversation just the
fact that that someone so senior was
calling me on a Saturday and spent an
hour talking to me was flattering in
itself but in the beginning he asked me
oh my son goes to uh Georgetown where
where are you staying I just said the
hotel and didn't think twice of it my
wife and I went back to the hotel after
we finished the museum tours and lo and
behold there was flowers and chocolates
and a bottle of champagne in our room
like he just took that one quue heard it
and had someone send us that to my hotel
before I got back and I I try to do that
a lot when I'm hiring someone senior you
know when I was running a company in
Singapore I had to relocate most people
and there it's not just the person
you're recruiting involved in that
decision it's there's a significant
other there's a family and so sending a
gift basket what it's like to live in
Singapore just thinking creatively
flying them out on the trip that's
awesome that's so cool I mean it's it
just
like my seventh grade basketball coach
used to say it's it's not the big things
it's the little things I guess like
flying to Thailand is kind of like a big
thing but like you know it just shows
that you care in in a world that kind of
just like doesn't have like a whole lot
of like care or like human
especially in interviewing like we just
get into these weird like robot States
like I I love how that is done yeah I do
you both feel like that has yeah sorry
do you both feel like that's subsided a
bit as of late like absolutely I don't
have any hard data but it's like
anecdotal like the Heyday there was a
lot of stuff you know and I just feel
like the last I don't know I just want
to ask if you if you both have noticed
less of it because I have noticed less
of it yeah and it's so we're in a
virtual world so many of us work
remotely and so you know you can click
on and click off for Zoom meetings and
so it does become more impersonal but I
do think for those that leverage the
personal touches it becomes even more
impactful more valuable because not as
many people are doing it yeah I totally
agree like my uh my mom still does
handwritten thank you
notes for everything I right and it's
like
I mean my handwriting is dog so I
don't do that but uh it it it just it
does feel like that Personal Touch has
been lost and you know Kelly I attribute
it to to the phone I know but like you
know you were one of the recipients I
sent I sent handwritten cards this
holiday season little holiday cheer and
my handwriting is also dog but
that's not really the point I I actually
w i I wasn't going to talk to you about
it but that is actually 100% true I will
screen shot it and Sh it on LinkedIn cuz
it's it's really bad it's like it's like
if it was a do I was like babe what does
this say
like uh as I say to my as I say to my
wife it's a thought that counts so you
you just put that on your mantle and you
know
Tom yes in addition to I love I love
this about you know creativity and the
team building and and town attraction um
how how did you sustain great teams
during you know the the the fun and the
hell of hypers scale and the pressure
and I just love to share kind of are you
like a trustfall guy like how did you
how did you keep those together and do
you have non-negotiables like I don't
care if you're excellent you do this and
you're out like what are some beliefs
you have to keep teams strong and
healthy yeah so
 
I I try to hire people that are
ambitious
hardworking strong gray matter because
smart people just figure things out uh
but also team players so non-negotiable
to me is a a non-team player you know a
mercenary or someone you know when
they're talking about I I I versus us or
we uh you know you're only as good as
the the team itself and if someone's you
know I hate politics and if someone's
going to introduce politics into an
organization they're it's going to be
destructive and so for me that's a
non-negotiable and then ethics you know
someone doing something unethical and
unfortunately it happens and that's a
non-negotiable for me too and so th
those are sort of the two
non-negotiables but in general if you
build a strong
team and you work hard together you
paint the vision and the goal and you
all rally around it but then you just
have fun doing it you know I'm very
close to hundreds of my former employees
and I love watching their careers and
the success they've had and continue to
back them invest in them be on their
board uh just stay in touch with them
when a lot of them live overseas so when
they're visiting the US have them over
uh at my place it's I I I love it and I
think that collegiality of of the teams
creates great br and it it's just a lot
of fun yeah that's totally true but so
Tom so topically right now uh you know
this is like I started another shitstorm
on LinkedIn Kelly but basically Meta
Meta has decid like meta came out
internally with an internal memo that
said hey we're changing our performance
process we're no longer going to give
people a year to turn around their
performance we're going to manage out
the bottom 5% we're going to give you
like really generous Severance but like
this is a change uh people are freaking
out about that and Tom I I just want to
like get like the nitty-gritty from you
ultimately you can do all this attribute
chart stuff you know you can like run
your regression analysis but you're
still going to miss in hiring it's
imperfect it's not a science and I have
always found the kind thing to do for
the employee for the employees
colleagues and for the company is to
manage that person out as fast as
possible what is your take on that I
 
meta stuff just making an announcement
that they're going to do it is odd I
mean it's at a different scale than I've
ever been at so I'm not going to get too
much into it it's maybe you have to do
that when you're that large of an
organization but I would never I would
never announce a month in advance we're
g to just let a bunch of people go
because all you do is create a bunch of
panic just like if I'm G to do a layoff
I'm not going to go I've seen some
companies go function by function so
everyone's completely distracted Ed and
stressed out until it gets to their team
I I just don't agree with that I we all
make mistakes we also there's people
that they either interview it really
well or they're they're great in the
domain but the culture fits not there
there's lots of reasons but you're best
off for both the company yourself and
the employee just to move on as quick as
possible I think it's really hard when
you get one or two layers down for
people to do that uh and especially when
you
hire good people they they tend to not
want to make those tougher decisions uh
and and it's hard um you you grow to
like someone but maybe their performance
isn't great and you've got to make that
tough
decision um but when you've done it
hundreds of times you sort of realize
that it's going to be okay in the end
like the person's going to land on their
feet and be just
fine and and I haven't read your
storm yet that you started Nolan but
come on we all know that it's not really
just about what was posted there's a lot
going on around Mark right now and I
suspect I refuse to call him Zuck
there's a lot going on with Mark right
now and I suspect that it's just all in
one one pot and I'm not you know taking
so I'm not you know but but I'm just
objectively there's there's a lot going
on so agree with that yeah and I do
think people have a hard time like
unpacking things um you know we'll we'll
have we should probably segment on that
one but okay so Tom the the thing you
had mentioned also is that you've had
multiple employees start
companies and I'm really interested in
this because like you know one of the
things uh at door Dash um we've had a
lot of employees start businesses too
and then at Carta we called it the Carta
cartel Henry like writes a check to
everybody um that wants to go start a
company I'm finding that like more and
more of these companies um specifically
if they have good leaders are really
encouraging
entrepreneurship um and then what ends
up happening is is if like the company's
unsuccessful you often see the employee
Boomerang back to the
company talk to me about like what's
your view of the world on this and how
have you fostered it on your teams yeah
I I mean part of it self- selection
right you're hiring people that are
Scrappy smart people driven that have
the profile of entrepreneurs and then
they come and they work for a few years
or more and they
learn what it takes to build a company
to get product Market fit to scale it
and you know they want to go they're
ambitious they want to go do it on their
own and when an employee comes to me and
says hey I'm I'm thinking of leaving
first of all I I always try to have a
very open position with employees where
I'm very transparent they're very
transparent if they're looking or
thinking you know I know well in advance
so it's not like here's my two week
notice and I'm I'm
out and the thing is what a lot of
people don't realize is people see how
you treat other exits so if you have one
or two bad examples then everyone's
going to close up and not say anything
to you right but if you treat someone
that's exiting even if you're frustrated
with them or they didn't work out but if
you treat them well then everyone's
going to be very open with you and you
earn that trust over time and so by
earning that trust and having them come
and say they're thinking about starting
something I can have a candidate
conversation with them it doesn't sound
like I'm trying to retain them I've had
you know an employee recently was
thinking about going to one of these uh
VCS that do U the incubators where they
come up with the idea and then you try
it and so I I didn't know it well but I
reached out to a few friends and I got a
lot of bad references I said look if
you're if you're going to go start
something just start something don't go
to this because you know the success
rate is is really low and I'll support
you and do it on your own and raise
funding separately uh I love when they
do that and yeah some of them do
Boomerang and some of them go off and
start really successful companies and I
love it this stage of my career I came
from a very very humble beginnings my
dad worked for the railroad made 25
Grand a year his whole life my mom
stayed at home they adopted terminally
kids we had a big family and I my dream
in life was to go to college because my
parents didn't and make $50,000 a year
I've accomplished everything I've wanted
in my life and so it's I get more
fulfillment out of watching the success
of my employees than I do any career
objective I could have at this stage
like that's what I enjoy and I love it
and just seeing you know being a
reference for them investing in them
giving them ad connecting them to people
that'll help them I I love it feel like
that's it's so rare it's so rare in
today's world right Kelly like Tom
that's such a cool St it's a what a cool
story of like your family too by the way
um but it's just it's just so rare in
today's world to like actually have
people that care and that's one of the
things Kelly is like when if you're a
job seeker and you have agency in your
search right um which is a big if right
and you get to that point in your career
I think one of the things that needs to
be at the very top of the things that
you care about is are you working with
real humans that you want to spend a
 ton of time with cuz like we spend
more time with our colleagues than we do
with our families and and being
altruistic in this industry and it's
it's it's always gonna win yep it does
Tom this was a blast thank you so much
for spending time with us today yeah
Kelly Nolan thank you it was great HR
