blew my mind with this you call it like
 
blew my mind with this you call it like
the employee attribute chart so can you
 
the employee attribute chart so can you
give our audience a quick download on
 
give our audience a quick download on
what this thing is why you do it and
 
what this thing is why you do it and
then just share your screen and give us
 
then just share your screen and give us
the the
 
the the
Insight yeah uh probably just to give a
 
Insight yeah uh probably just to give a
little bit of context before I flash a
 
little bit of context before I flash a
confusing screen up but it's it's
 
confusing screen up but it's it's
something I use specifically when I'm
 
something I use specifically when I'm
hiring large numbers for the same role
 
hiring large numbers for the same role
so think in sales AES or bdrs or sdrs or
 
so think in sales AES or bdrs or sdrs or
support reps or csms whenever you've got
 
support reps or csms whenever you've got
uh a current role that you have to fill
 
uh a current role that you have to fill
and there's tens if not hundreds of them
 
and there's tens if not hundreds of them
try to get it down more to a science
 
try to get it down more to a science
than uh individual individual emotions
 
than uh individual individual emotions
and who you like when you're
 
and who you like when you're
interviewing them and so what I I do and
 
interviewing them and so what I I do and
you could do this when you're building
 
you could do this when you're building
out a new team or you can do this when
 
out a new team or you can do this when
you're coming in and evaluating the
 
you're coming in and evaluating the
current team and trying to scale it I I
 
current team and trying to scale it I I
look at titl seek sales for example and
 
look at titl seek sales for example and
I'll show you the example when I share
 
I'll show you the example when I share
my screen of sales there's about 20
 
my screen of sales there's about 20
attributes that could be correlated to
 
attributes that could be correlated to
success in a role when you're in a sales
 
success in a role when you're in a sales
role at the company uh some people
 
role at the company uh some people
emotionally get attached to certain
 
emotionally get attached to certain
attributes over others but the data
 
attributes over others but the data
doesn't lie and so what I'll do is I'll
 
doesn't lie and so what I'll do is I'll
go and score those 20 attributes if I'm
 
go and score those 20 attributes if I'm
working with a current team say we've
 
working with a current team say we've
got 30 AES I'll have three different
 
got 30 AES I'll have three different
sales managers score on each of those
 
sales managers score on each of those
different attributes on a scale from one
 
different attributes on a scale from one
to five and the reason I have three
 
to five and the reason I have three
managers is because you know everyone
 
managers is because you know everyone
evaluates people differently and so to
 
evaluates people differently and so to
get some of that noise out of the way
 
get some of that noise out of the way
you have three different managers score
 
you have three different managers score
them and then you run a regression
 
them and then you run a regression
analysis against the past either 6
 
analysis against the past either 6
months or 12 months of performance six
 
months or 12 months of performance six
months works if it's a fairly linear
 
months works if it's a fairly linear
sales cycle you have a very seasonal
 
sales cycle you have a very seasonal
sales cycle you need to do 12
 
sales cycle you need to do 12
months and then always without a doubt
 
months and then always without a doubt
four or five of them come up very
 
four or five of them come up very
correlated and everything else is just
 
correlated and everything else is just
noise and so you can focus your entire
 
noise and so you can focus your entire
recruiting effort on those four or five
 
recruiting effort on those four or five
attributes and really focusing on them
 
attributes and really focusing on them
as opposed to Boiling the ocean and what
 
as opposed to Boiling the ocean and what
happens in most of these scenarios is
 
happens in most of these scenarios is
you really like someone you connect with
 
you really like someone you connect with
them and then you want to hire that
 
them and then you want to hire that
person but they're not always the best
 
person but they're not always the best
or the best fit for the role or for the
 
or the best fit for the role or for the
company I'll share my screen here so so
 
company I'll share my screen here so so
as you do this so like just let me let
 
as you do this so like just let me let
me play that back slightly differently
 
me play that back slightly differently
so what I'm hearing is is like these are
 
so what I'm hearing is is like these are
the 20 attributes that matter for a
 
the 20 attributes that matter for a
specific role regardless of the company
 
specific role regardless of the company
then what you what you're saying is is
 
then what you what you're saying is is
there's like four or five of these that
 
there's like four or five of these that
matter contextually for the company and
 
matter contextually for the company and
what you're doing is is then you know
 
what you're doing is is then you know
the way you figure out those four to
 
the way you figure out those four to
five is you're looking back on the top
 
five is you're looking back on the top
performers and then what you're doing is
 
performers and then what you're doing is
saying like now we need to assess for
 
saying like now we need to assess for
these very specifically in the interview
 
these very specifically in the interview
process is that right yes and it does
 
process is that right yes and it does
very I've done it in many companies both
 
very I've done it in many companies both
companies I've been a part of them
 
companies I've been a part of them
companies I've helped advise or been on
 
companies I've helped advise or been on
the board of it varies by company and
 
the board of it varies by company and
that's the the sort of surprising
 
that's the the sort of surprising
Insight now some of them are are quite
 
Insight now some of them are are quite
consistent so if you look at the list
 
consistent so if you look at the list
here uh I would say grit and and work
 
here uh I would say grit and and work
ethic tend to always rise to the top for
 
ethic tend to always rise to the top for
sales specifically and then some always
 
sales specifically and then some always
are on the bottom and so one I I don't
 
are on the bottom and so one I I don't
see here industry
 
see here industry
expertise uh that you know just some
 
expertise uh that you know just some
specific examples at how we hired former
 
specific examples at how we hired former
interior designers to be salespeople
 
interior designers to be salespeople
thinking they could speak the same lingo
 
thinking they could speak the same lingo
at Bill we hired former CPAs and
 
at Bill we hired former CPAs and
accountants thinking they could speak
 
accountants thinking they could speak
the same lingo horrible sales people uh
 
the same lingo horrible sales people uh
and Industry expertise never is a
 
and Industry expertise never is a
correlating factor to success uh and and
 
correlating factor to success uh and and
then some some are very company specific
 
then some some are very company specific
so at how competitiveness was very high
 
so at how competitiveness was very high
at Bill it was not an attribute
 
at Bill it was not an attribute
correlated at all but then when we
 
correlated at all but then when we
acquired divy divy was very high on the
 
acquired divy divy was very high on the
competitiv side and that that really
 
competitiv side and that that really
goes to the the culture you have and
 
goes to the the culture you have and
that you've built and that's why not all
 
that you've built and that's why not all
attributes are the same at all
 
attributes are the same at all
companies one one thing to note is a lot
 
companies one one thing to note is a lot
of people are like well this these are
 
of people are like well this these are
too many questions to go by when you're
 
too many questions to go by when you're
interviewing but that's why you have
 
interviewing but that's why you have
questions or cues and you notice more
 
questions or cues and you notice more
than half of these you can answer with
 
than half of these you can answer with
cu's where you don't even have to ask
 
cu's where you don't even have to ask
them a question you know uh how
 
them a question you know uh how
interested are they in the job or how
 
interested are they in the job or how
you know how much do they prep they you
 
you know how much do they prep they you
can judge that based on the questions
 
can judge that based on the questions
they're asking you have they gone to
 
they're asking you have they gone to
LinkedIn profile are they leaning in um
 
LinkedIn profile are they leaning in um
some examples here you know curiosity do
 
some examples here you know curiosity do
they ask a lot of questions are they
 
they ask a lot of questions are they
good questions are they naturally
 
good questions are they naturally
curious about the business it's not like
 
curious about the business it's not like
you have to ask them are you a curious
 
you have to ask them are you a curious
person like you're not you're you're
 
person like you're not you're you're
going to get a canned answer out on that
 
going to get a canned answer out on that
and so a lot of them might try to answer
 
and so a lot of them might try to answer
with cu's as opposed to questions that's
 
with cu's as opposed to questions that's
super interesting okay so if you're
 
super interesting okay so if you're
listening and you're not watching on
 
listening and you're not watching on
video what we're looking at here is a
 
video what we're looking at here is a
Google sheet uh that has three three
 
Google sheet uh that has three three
four columns so column one says
 
four columns so column one says
attribute uh two says description three
 
attribute uh two says description three
says QE or question uh and then four
 
says QE or question uh and then four
says example questions or cues to
 
says example questions or cues to
evaluate and so for example if we go
 
evaluate and so for example if we go
across on one of these like you have
 
across on one of these like you have
coachability uh and then is the
 
coachability uh and then is the
candidate or how receptive is the
 
candidate or how receptive is the
candidate to feedback that's a question
 
candidate to feedback that's a question
uh and then here's an example question
 
uh and then here's an example question
which is after the role play give the
 
which is after the role play give the
candidate feedback and have them do it
 
candidate feedback and have them do it
again see how well they listen and
 
again see how well they listen and
incorporate that feedback
 
incorporate that feedback
correct okay so Tom talk to me about
 
correct okay so Tom talk to me about
this regression
 
this regression
analysis yeah so it's I mean it sounds
 
analysis yeah so it's I mean it sounds
complicated but it it does it's it's
 
complicated but it it does it's it's
pretty straightforward it's you take the
 
pretty straightforward it's you take the
scores and you correlate them to uh
 
scores and you correlate them to uh
sales performance in in this case uh brr
 
sales performance in in this case uh brr
sdrs would be different it' be more
 
sdrs would be different it' be more
activity based performance and the ones
 
activity based performance and the ones
that are the most correlated to uh
 
that are the most correlated to uh
success meaning a good track record
 
success meaning a good track record
within the company are the ones that are
 
within the company are the ones that are
going to be higher obviously the the
 
going to be higher obviously the the
greater your in is meaning the greater
 
greater your in is meaning the greater
number of 80s you have the the better
 
number of 80s you have the the better
the data set is so when you're building
 
the data set is so when you're building
out a team it does take some Cycles to
 
out a team it does take some Cycles to
get this right you don't get it right
 
get this right you don't get it right
with the first five reps you hire you
 
with the first five reps you hire you
you need a bigger end and it'll change
 
you need a bigger end and it'll change
over time too as the company evolves and
 
over time too as the company evolves and
scales early days maybe you don't have
 
scales early days maybe you don't have
perfect product Market fit you're still
 
perfect product Market fit you're still
figuring things out it's a different
 
figuring things out it's a different
type of DNA you're going to need when
 
type of DNA you're going to need when
you're got strong product Market fit and
 
you're got strong product Market fit and
you're just uh scaling as fast as
 
you're just uh scaling as fast as
possible it'll probably be a different
 
possible it'll probably be a different
set of attributes Kelly have you ever
 
set of attributes Kelly have you ever
seen one of these
 
seen one of these
yeah I was going to ask you but how when
 
yeah I was going to ask you but how when
who did this did this come about has it
 
who did this did this come about has it
been static have you had to evolve it or
 
been static have you had to evolve it or
change it I mean I I love it you know I
 
change it I mean I I love it you know I
we I think we see the different
 
we I think we see the different
variations of this I'd love just to hear
 
variations of this I'd love just to hear
the story for folks on yeah I started
 
the story for folks on yeah I started
doing a variation of
 
doing a variation of
this uh at house uh basically because we
 
this uh at house uh basically because we
were growing extremely fast I think it
 
were growing extremely fast I think it
was maybe 50 people when I join joed and
 
was maybe 50 people when I join joed and
we scaled it to a couple thousand over
 
we scaled it to a couple thousand over
uh a few years and we just we needed to
 
uh a few years and we just we needed to
grow really really fast I mean that was
 
grow really really fast I mean that was
a days of hyperscaling right and going
 
a days of hyperscaling right and going
across many countries and you wanted to
 
across many countries and you wanted to
get the the framework right before you
 
get the the framework right before you
added you know we were doing five
 
added you know we were doing five
countries at a time and you didn't want
 
countries at a time and you didn't want
to go and do 10 countries and realize
 
to go and do 10 countries and realize
you got the formula wrong and so uh and
 
you got the formula wrong and so uh and
then I I read a book uh it's actually he
 
then I I read a book uh it's actually he
since become a friend a good guy guy

he talks about and how he thinks about
it is very similar to what I was doing
 
it is very similar to what I was doing
so I you know I I learned a lot from
 
so I you know I I learned a lot from
what he was doing and you know took some
 
what he was doing and you know took some
of my uh thinking behind it and took
 
of my uh thinking behind it and took
some of his thinking and uh and I've
 
some of his thinking and uh and I've
evolved it you know I started just in
 
evolved it you know I started just in
sales doing it but it works within
 
sales doing it but it works within
support it works within uh post sales
 
support it works within uh post sales
customer support it works basically
 
customer support it works basically
wherever you have a lot of roles that
 
wherever you have a lot of roles that
are doing the same
 
are doing the same
job I I mean I I think we've all seen
 
job I I mean I I think we've all seen
different variations of this over the
 
different variations of this over the
years you know it's it's wonderful Tom
 
years you know it's it's wonderful Tom
and I think you know my my view on this
 
and I think you know my my view on this
if you look at the attributes a lot of
 
if you look at the attributes a lot of
them
 
them
are hard to measure you know what I mean
 
are hard to measure you know what I mean
they're subjective they're like these
 
they're subjective they're like these
human characteristics that are that are
 
human characteristics that are that are
magical when people just nail them but
 
magical when people just nail them but
they're very hard to Define assess even
 
they're very hard to Define assess even
explain sometimes and they're the kind
 
explain sometimes and they're the kind
of thing where if you ask 10 people what
 
of thing where if you ask 10 people what
do you mean by this you'll get six or
 
do you mean by this you'll get six or
seven different answers and that's why I
 
seven different answers and that's why I
like it because you you have attempted
 
like it because you you have attempted
or maybe mastered I guess I mean how to
 
or maybe mastered I guess I mean how to
like make tangible these things and
 
like make tangible these things and
unpack them that it's like culture right
 
unpack them that it's like culture right
how do you define that and make it in a
 
how do you define that and make it in a
way that people can touch it and feel it
 
way that people can touch it and feel it
or values or whatever the thing that
 
or values or whatever the thing that
that's always the hardest part so I
 
that's always the hardest part so I
guess i' love for the audience to hear
 
guess i' love for the audience to hear
and selfishly because we haven't talked
 
and selfishly because we haven't talked
about this how did you do that because
 
about this how did you do that because
the attributes in the left column are
 
the attributes in the left column are
one thing thing what I think is the gold
 
one thing thing what I think is the gold
part of this which probably was a pain
 
part of this which probably was a pain
in the ass was the questions to get to
 
in the ass was the questions to get to
the cues and to train others to realize
 
the cues and to train others to realize
how to unpack that and judge it because
 
how to unpack that and judge it because
that's like the hardest part yeah 100
 
that's like the hardest part yeah 100
perc uh it is it is part of uh the
 
perc uh it is it is part of uh the
exercise so first there's when you're
 
exercise so first there's when you're
evaluating a current team getting
 
evaluating a current team getting
everyone on the same page on what each
 
everyone on the same page on what each
of those attributes mean so you have
 
of those attributes mean so you have
some consistency when you're scoring
 
some consistency when you're scoring
it's never perfect it's not
 
it's never perfect it's not
you're trying to bring a you're trying
 
you're trying to bring a you're trying
to make it uh you're trying to make
 
to make it uh you're trying to make
something objective that is naturally
 
something objective that is naturally
subjective right or something
 
subjective right or something
quantitative that's qualitative and
 
quantitative that's qualitative and
that's it's imperfect but getting
 
that's it's imperfect but getting
everyone on the same Baseline helps and
 
everyone on the same Baseline helps and
then uh training those that are doing
 
then uh training those that are doing
the recruiting and the interviewing also
 
the recruiting and the interviewing also
helps uh over time people people get it
 
helps uh over time people people get it
and the other thing that I we can get
 
and the other thing that I we can get
into later but when I recruiting I also
 
into later but when I recruiting I also
like to have a lot of interviews and
 
like to have a lot of interviews and
I've got a lot of reasons around that
 
I've got a lot of reasons around that
because I think the more data points are
 
because I think the more data points are
the better uh and it's not just the more
 
the better uh and it's not just the more
data points but it's also and this goes
 
data points but it's also and this goes
back to very early in my career one of
 
back to very early in my career one of
my first jobs working at BCG I was
 
my first jobs working at BCG I was
interviewing with BCG McKenzie and Bane
 
interviewing with BCG McKenzie and Bane
and they put you through like four
 
and they put you through like four
rounds of three case study interviews
 
rounds of three case study interviews
each and you're prepping for these and
 
each and you're prepping for these and
you go in them you don't know what to
 
you go in them you don't know what to
expect and by the time you're doing the
 
expect and by the time you're doing the
the fourth round you're in their office
 
the fourth round you're in their office
they're not visiting you on campus
 
they're not visiting you on campus
and you know you go through the cycle of
 
and you know you go through the cycle of
working just so hard to try to get the
 
working just so hard to try to get the
job that I remember driving back across
 
job that I remember driving back across
the bay bridge and getting a call from
 
the bay bridge and getting a call from
BCG and saying we want to extend you an
 
BCG and saying we want to extend you an
offer like I want to accept on the spot
 
offer like I want to accept on the spot
I worked so hard to get it and I didn't
 
I worked so hard to get it and I didn't
care what the I didn't ask you know how
 
care what the I didn't ask you know how
much the comp was I didn't ask what
 
much the comp was I didn't ask what
office they were going to put me in I
 
office they were going to put me in I
asked nothing I just wanted to accept
 
asked nothing I just wanted to accept
and then not only when you do that not
 
and then not only when you do that not
only do people feel like they've earned
 
only do people feel like they've earned
it and they're have a much higher
 
it and they're have a much higher
likelihood to accept but they're also a
 
likelihood to accept but they're also a
much more committed employee because
 
much more committed employee because
they feel like they've earned it and
 
they feel like they've earned it and
it's just a different mindset when they
 
it's just a different mindset when they
start and so I know a lot of people
 
start and so I know a lot of people
don't like long processes larger
 
don't like long processes larger
companies you tend to also get it
 
companies you tend to also get it
becomes a really slow elongated process
 
becomes a really slow elongated process
you don't want that either but it is
 
you don't want that either but it is
nice to have people feel like they've
 
nice to have people feel like they've
earned it like I've had offers where
 
earned it like I've had offers where
I've interviewed with two or three
 
I've interviewed with two or three
people and I feel like they didn't even
 
people and I feel like they didn't even
test me you get an offer and it's yeah I
 
test me you get an offer and it's yeah I
just don't appreciate it the same way
 
just don't appreciate it the same way
yeah you have like an an emotional
 
yeah you have like an an emotional
investment already with that group of
 
investment already with that group of
people that's a really I I like that
 
people that's a really I I like that
take I mean when I was at Google we
 
take I mean when I was at Google we
instituted the the rule of four which
 
instituted the the rule of four which
meant you couldn't have more than four
 
meant you couldn't have more than four
on-site interviews and the reason we did
 
on-site interviews and the reason we did
that was because with people analytics
 
that was because with people analytics
we looked at the data and said we don't
 
we looked at the data and said we don't
learn anything more after that that
 
learn anything more after that that
actually turned out to not be true like
 
actually turned out to not be true like
four people four people or four trips
 
four people four people or four trips
four on-site interviews four different
 
four on-site interviews four different
interviewers 45 minutes long yeah yeah
 
interviewers 45 minutes long yeah yeah
and that's also only looking at half of
 
and that's also only looking at half of
it you're only considering what you get
 
it you're only considering what you get
from those interviews not what the
 
from those interviews not what the
employee gets too because the employee
 
employee gets too because the employee
feels like they've met more people
 
feels like they've met more people
they've be they they have more points of
 
they've be they they have more points of
contact they get more comfortable
 
contact they get more comfortable
uh and people also s to let the guard
 
uh and people also s to let the guard
down over time too so you know the first
 
down over time too so you know the first
interview everyone's very stiff and
 
interview everyone's very stiff and
buttoned up and by the sixth or seventh
 
buttoned up and by the sixth or seventh
interview they'll drop an fbom because
 
interview they'll drop an fbom because
they feel more comfortable totally I
 
they feel more comfortable totally I
actually found though too that you know
 
actually found though too that you know
four interviews it's it feels like speed
 
four interviews it's it feels like speed
dating on both
 
dating on both
sides hey everyone we'll be right back
 
sides hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after award from our
 
in a moment after award from our
sponsors I must admit I used to believe

have them sell what they're selling
today and walk me through it and see how
 
today and walk me through it and see how
it goes and then always give them
 
it goes and then always give them
feedback have them do it again and see
 
feedback have them do it again and see
how coachable they are and how they
 
how coachable they are and how they
incorporate that feedback it's very
 
incorporate that feedback it's very
important in a sales role I think that

tangible so that maybe eight out of 10
 
tangible so that maybe eight out of 10
people say it the same way versus like
 
people say it the same way versus like
three out of 10 before so I think it's
 
three out of 10 before so I think it's
really cool trying to trying to make
 
really cool trying to trying to make
that real and scale that out yeah and it
 
that real and scale that out yeah and it
