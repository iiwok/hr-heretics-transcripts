but we really Endeavor to back up as
much of our Guidance with data as we can
 
much of our Guidance with data as we can
and we don't really want to replicate
 
and we don't really want to replicate
what's already out there we're so lucky
 
what's already out there we're so lucky
that our friends that Norwest and light
 
that our friends that Norwest and light
spe and so many other firms are are open
 
spe and so many other firms are are open
sourcing and Publishing their reports
 
sourcing and Publishing their reports
that we synthesize a lot of those and
 
that we synthesize a lot of those and
then where we see gaps in the data we
 
then where we see gaps in the data we
will once or twice a year conduct
 
will once or twice a year conduct
surveys ourselves so this Equity refresh
 
surveys ourselves so this Equity refresh
report is the one that we took on this
 
report is the one that we took on this
year and frankly designing it told me a
 
year and frankly designing it told me a
lot about why nobody has really done
 
lot about why nobody has really done
this before because asking the questions
 
this before because asking the questions
in a right way was was really
 
in a right way was was really
challenging and and I really wanted
 
challenging and and I really wanted
thank so many people including guests
 
thank so many people including guests
that you've had on this show for helping
 
that you've had on this show for helping
us with designing that and then getting
 
us with designing that and then getting
it out there so to your question on key
 
it out there so to your question on key
findings the the purpose of this survey
 
findings the the purpose of this survey
was really to talk about the design so
 
was really to talk about the design so
this isn't supposed to be like a
 
this isn't supposed to be like a
benchmarking report of you know what
 
benchmarking report of you know what
percentage Equity refresh to give to
 
percentage Equity refresh to give to
employees but really more about how
 
employees but really more about how
companies today are constructing their
 
companies today are constructing their
Equity refresh programs and the findings
 
Equity refresh programs and the findings
I found to be really interesting
 
I found to be really interesting
especially given sort of my history and
 
especially given sort of my history and
experience designing programs like this
 
experience designing programs like this
at startups and the main one that I
 
at startups and the main one that I
would sort of highlight is that it's
 
would sort of highlight is that it's
really clear that the macroeconomic
 
really clear that the macroeconomic
climate is impacting the way companies
 
climate is impacting the way companies
are issuing followon grants and refresh
 
are issuing followon grants and refresh
grants so they're definitely being more
 
grants so they're definitely being more
judicious about equity delution and
 
judicious about equity delution and
really focusing on retaining top
 
really focusing on retaining top
performers so you know
 
performers so you know
 
prioritize refresh grants for in based
 
prioritize refresh grants for in based
on individual performance when we talked
 
on individual performance when we talked
about eligibility performance was really
 
about eligibility performance was really
highly rated as a factor that was in
 
highly rated as a factor that was in
there and I want to contrast that from
 
there and I want to contrast that from
you know the era of like not to say
 
you know the era of like not to say
Company still don't have like the box
 
Company still don't have like the box
car model or or whatever the wealth
 
car model or or whatever the wealth
front model of you know here's everybody
 
front model of you know here's everybody
get something because they're here and
 
get something because they're here and
and you know they've hadit a 10year
 
and you know they've hadit a 10year
milestone this to me is a departure from
 
milestone this to me is a departure from
where we have been where refresh is
 
where we have been where refresh is
typically and I use the word typically
 
typically and I use the word typically
really Loosely because I don't think
 
really Loosely because I don't think
there is a typical having sort of
 
there is a typical having sort of
studied this but there really is this
 
studied this but there really is this
focus on performance in a way that is a
 
focus on performance in a way that is a
departure from how refresh grants in
 
departure from how refresh grants in
particular have been handled so that was
 
particular have been handled so that was
that was like a major takeaway um and
 
that was like a major takeaway um and
then the others were really around the
 
then the others were really around the
calculation and the terms so really
 
calculation and the terms so really
focusing on a just a fraction of what a
 
focusing on a just a fraction of what a
new higher Grant uh is in terms of what
 
new higher Grant uh is in terms of what
the size of the grant is and again you
 
the size of the grant is and again you
know there have been debates around like
 
know there have been debates around like
well you know at three years or four
 
well you know at three years or four
years if you're granting refreshes then
 
years if you're granting refreshes then
should you fully rehire someone should
 
should you fully rehire someone should
you give them fully what they've
 
you give them fully what they've
received before I mean that would be
 
received before I mean that would be
very generous and believe me I've had
 
very generous and believe me I've had
companies advocate for that companies
 
companies advocate for that companies
have taken that position it's highly
 
have taken that position it's highly
dilutive obviously and completely
 
dilutive obviously and completely
disregards the sort of upside value of
 
disregards the sort of upside value of
that new higher Grant so really we were
 
that new higher Grant so really we were
able to put some data behind you know
 
able to put some data behind you know
being thoughtful about who you're
 
being thoughtful about who you're
spending spending it on how much you're
 
spending spending it on how much you're
spending it and then I think the other
 
spending it and then I think the other
interesting thing was like almost half
 
interesting thing was like almost half
did not have a vesting Cliff so 47% had
 
did not have a vesting Cliff so 47% had
no vesting Cliff that was also an
 
no vesting Cliff that was also an
interesting insight into the way that
 
interesting insight into the way that
companies are structuring refresh grants
 
companies are structuring refresh grants
compared to to new higher grants so my
 
compared to to new higher grants so my
take on this is like I would have
 
take on this is like I would have
expected cash to be more conservative
 
expected cash to be more conservative
given the new macro environment and C
 
given the new macro environment and C
has actually pushed out data recently
 
has actually pushed out data recently
that says like that's not the case like
 
that says like that's not the case like
cash is not really coming down and
 
cash is not really coming down and
Equity is and yet most companies have
 
Equity is and yet most companies have
valuations probably still to this point
 
valuations probably still to this point
that might be out of whack towards the
 
that might be out of whack towards the
highend and so what is causing the
 
highend and so what is causing the
microscope to be put on Equity right now
 
microscope to be put on Equity right now
yeah well I do think you know managing
 
yeah well I do think you know managing
that that cap table and managing that
 
that that cap table and managing that
Equity pool you know think
 
Equity pool you know think
about I think companies when they
 
about I think companies when they
thinking they're thinking about Runway
 
thinking they're thinking about Runway
they're thinking about their cash Runway
 
they're thinking about their cash Runway
but they also have a Runway when it
 
but they also have a Runway when it
comes to their Equity pool because
 
comes to their Equity pool because
otherwise they have to go back to their
 
otherwise they have to go back to their
investors and expand the pool and really
 
investors and expand the pool and really
justify why they're doing that when
 
justify why they're doing that when
they're facing a number of other
 
they're facing a number of other
headwinds so you know I was always
 
headwinds so you know I was always
taught in sort of startup comp land to
 
taught in sort of startup comp land to
treat Equity the same as cash which is
 
treat Equity the same as cash which is
not the way many companies at least you
 
not the way many companies at least you
know many years ago thought about it
 
know many years ago thought about it
they thought about it as this like free
 
they thought about it as this like free
thing that they can give out and you
 
thing that they can give out and you
know it is worth nothing thing early on
 
know it is worth nothing thing early on
in the company's history but once it
 
in the company's history but once it
really does have have and I'll be
 
really does have have and I'll be
careful not to use the word tangible
 
careful not to use the word tangible
value because obviously there's issues
 
value because obviously there's issues
around liquidity and and the point you
 
around liquidity and and the point you
raised around valuation but once it
 
raised around valuation but once it
starts to have more sort of value to it
 
starts to have more sort of value to it
it really in my opinion is important to
 
it really in my opinion is important to
treat it as carefully as cash and to
 
treat it as carefully as cash and to
really help people understand what the
 
really help people understand what the
value of that is so you know I I think
 
value of that is so you know I I think
investors are scrutinizing requests to
 
investors are scrutinizing requests to
expand option pools as much as they are
 
expand option pools as much as they are
ISR izing operating expenses and if
 
ISR izing operating expenses and if
companies are waiting longer before
 
companies are waiting longer before
their next fund raise or having
 
their next fund raise or having
challenges ahead of their next fundraise
 
challenges ahead of their next fundraise
you know they're they're try trying to
 
you know they're they're try trying to
be careful about what do they need in
 
be careful about what do they need in
order to hire key talent and of course
 
order to hire key talent and of course
retain Talent too totally totally agree
 
retain Talent too totally totally agree
I mean expanding the pool in hard times
 
I mean expanding the pool in hard times
like this especially if you have a
 
like this especially if you have a
bloated valuation is dangerous right I
 
bloated valuation is dangerous right I
mean and so I think I think that the
 
mean and so I think I think that the
scrutiny on that makes total sense just
 
scrutiny on that makes total sense just
from experience gesu did you see in your
 
from experience gesu did you see in your
survey based on all of that kind of
 
survey based on all of that kind of
refresh grants with maybe shorter
 
refresh grants with maybe shorter
vesting schedules shorter grants to help
 
vesting schedules shorter grants to help
with that interestingly the vesting
 
with that interestingly the vesting
periods that were most common were just
 
periods that were most common were just
over four years still and you know I
 
over four years still and you know I
think at the end of the day and I think
 
think at the end of the day and I think
this is where it's tricky too because
 
this is where it's tricky too because
companies use equity in different ways
 
companies use equity in different ways
sometimes it's in lie of having bonus
 
sometimes it's in lie of having bonus
plans for example or really trying to
 
plans for example or really trying to
make up for lower cash although I I
 
make up for lower cash although I I
think that's been happening less I've
 
think that's been happening less I've
been noticing that like it's not as
 
been noticing that like it's not as
common to sort of make up for the lower
 
common to sort of make up for the lower
cash offer in in sort of that same way
 
cash offer in in sort of that same way
that I I felt like was the case maybe
 
that I I felt like was the case maybe
you know SE six years ago but it still
 
you know SE six years ago but it still
is a long-term incentive tool so like
 
is a long-term incentive tool so like
cash is the short-term play and Equity
 
cash is the short-term play and Equity
is the longterm play so you know I think
 
is the longterm play so you know I think
that explains why you still want that
 
that explains why you still want that
four-year time Horizon but I think the
 
four-year time Horizon but I think the
of that Cliff gives a little bit more
 
of that Cliff gives a little bit more
recognition to the fact that you're a
 
recognition to the fact that you're a
known quantity and that you know we're
 
known quantity and that you know we're
not going to make you wait a year to
 
not going to make you wait a year to
vest into this Equity you're somebody
 
vest into this Equity you're somebody
that we want and we want to keep here
 
that we want and we want to keep here
and so you know we're not going to place
 
and so you know we're not going to place
that cliff on it that that I thought was
 
that cliff on it that that I thought was
was sort of more reflective of of that
 
was sort of more reflective of of that
recognition of it being different than
 
recognition of it being different than
for a new hire yeah we had that
 
for a new hire yeah we had that
discussion at Carta actually with the
 
discussion at Carta actually with the
cliff and you know obviously the board
 
cliff and you know obviously the board
is going to push to include the cliff on
 
is going to push to include the cliff on
the refresh program and the reason why
 
the refresh program and the reason why
is because if somebody departs then that
 
is because if somebody departs then that
that Equity goes back into the pool and
 
that Equity goes back into the pool and
they're less deluded our take was like
 
they're less deluded our take was like
that's not the right thing to do they've
 
that's not the right thing to do they've
already been here making them wait with
 
already been here making them wait with
more golden handcuffs I think could
 
more golden handcuffs I think could
actually lead to poor behaviors so like
 
actually lead to poor behaviors so like
they're just sitting in the seat waiting
 
they're just sitting in the seat waiting
until their next vesting date and that's
 
until their next vesting date and that's
where we landed as like no Cliff
 
where we landed as like no Cliff
refreshes but I do want to just quickly
 
refreshes but I do want to just quickly
take a minute on on performance and so
 
take a minute on on performance and so
you're saying hey almost every everybody
 
you're saying hey almost every everybody
now when they do a refresh Grant is
 
now when they do a refresh Grant is
thinking about performance and I think
 
thinking about performance and I think
that's great I've seen this phenomenon
 
that's great I've seen this phenomenon
in recruiting to
 
in recruiting to
where you know everyone says we want to
 
where you know everyone says we want to
pay for performance yet we extend
 
pay for performance yet we extend
significantly for the new hire and yet
 
significantly for the new hire and yet
for somebody who is a proven quantity
 
for somebody who is a proven quantity
you would just set it of like when they
 
you would just set it of like when they
get to their third or fourth year should
 
get to their third or fourth year should
we give them a new Grant as if they were
 
we give them a new Grant as if they were
a new hire isn't the answer obviously
 
a new hire isn't the answer obviously
yes like we have data on them like
 
yes like we have data on them like
interviews are completely
 
interviews are completely
imperfect and yet we continue to index
 
imperfect and yet we continue to index
on hiring as opposed to investing in in
 
on hiring as opposed to investing in in
the existing talent that we have so this
 
the existing talent that we have so this
is my soap box which I will gently step
 
is my soap box which I will gently step
off of now but I'm curious to get your
 
off of now but I'm curious to get your
take in what you see given the aperture
 
take in what you see given the aperture
that you have yeah I mean look I I love
 
that you have yeah I mean look I I love
to sort of we know we got to reason from
 
to sort of we know we got to reason from
first principles here and so there
 
first principles here and so there
there's definitely a rational argument
 
there's definitely a rational argument
to be made of look isn't this person's
 
to be made of look isn't this person's
alternative to go and get another
 
alternative to go and get another
fouryear grand somewhere else and fully
 
fouryear grand somewhere else and fully
get rehired somewhere else like what is
 
get rehired somewhere else like what is
stopping them from doing that and why
 
stopping them from doing that and why
wouldn't we do the same for them that
 
wouldn't we do the same for them that
that another company is willing to do so
 
that another company is willing to do so
I mean a couple of things one especially
 
I mean a couple of things one especially
in a bold Talent
 
in a bold Talent
Market you know the the desperation
 
Market you know the the desperation
leads to a lot of you know extreme
 
leads to a lot of you know extreme
behaviors and so I think there's just a
 
behaviors and so I think there's just a
lot more of attention and and unknown
 
lot more of attention and and unknown
quantities on both sides right it's not
 
quantities on both sides right it's not
just is the employee you know you're
 
just is the employee you know you're
really hungry for that Talent you really
 
really hungry for that Talent you really
desperate to have them and then on the
 
desperate to have them and then on the
flip side for the employee the employee
 
flip side for the employee the employee
like I don't know you you know is your
 
like I don't know you you know is your
culture going to be someplace I really
 
culture going to be someplace I really
want to work is this going to be the
 
want to work is this going to be the
place I really want to spend my time and
 
place I really want to spend my time and
and so I think just from a negotiating
 
and so I think just from a negotiating
leverage standpoint that new higher
 
leverage standpoint that new higher
Grant it doesn't surprise me that those
 
Grant it doesn't surprise me that those
continue to be sort of targeted higher
 
continue to be sort of targeted higher
if you're extracting someone from
 
if you're extracting someone from
another very compelling opportunity
 
another very compelling opportunity
there's just a lot there that explains
 
there's just a lot there that explains
why there's a premium placed on that on
 
why there's a premium placed on that on
your point around around sort of follow
 
your point around around sort of follow
on and refresh grants I think
 
on and refresh grants I think
look if you were to follow that logic of
 
look if you were to follow that logic of
like oh well we should you know
 
like oh well we should you know
completely rehire this person because we
 
completely rehire this person because we
value them that much it completely
 
value them that much it completely
places it zero their existing Holdings
 
places it zero their existing Holdings
and I think like when we were
 
and I think like when we were
constructing some of this instacar when
 
constructing some of this instacar when
we were thinking about our refresh
 
we were thinking about our refresh
grants we had a lot of debate around it
 
grants we had a lot of debate around it
and there was a lot of discussion around
 
and there was a lot of discussion around
like oh well is this person you know
 
like oh well is this person you know
this person has like a ton of equity
 
this person has like a ton of equity
it's okay that their cash is like so
 
it's okay that their cash is like so
much lower than everyone else or well
 
much lower than everyone else or well
well that person's not super vested in
 
well that person's not super vested in
their Equity so like how you know how
 
their Equity so like how you know how
should we be thinking about that and so
 
should we be thinking about that and so
I think what it solves for is that
 
I think what it solves for is that
largely you do want people playing for
 
largely you do want people playing for
their new higher grants and this goes
 
their new higher grants and this goes
for executives too the majority of their
 
for executives too the majority of their
value is in their new higher grants and
 
value is in their new higher grants and
so you really want people to like treat
 
so you really want people to like treat
that as like not zero right and to
 
that as like not zero right and to
really think about like building on the
 
really think about like building on the
value of that initially and then yes
 
value of that initially and then yes
like continued recognition having you
 
like continued recognition having you
know carrots in front of them you know
 
know carrots in front of them you know
as you're on this longer term Sprint
 
as you're on this longer term Sprint
like it makes sense to continue to reup
 
like it makes sense to continue to reup
it but you know in the era that I was in
 
it but you know in the era that I was in
instacart this was at a different
 
instacart this was at a different
company was before it was public it was
 
company was before it was public it was
still a founder-led business the CEO
 
still a founder-led business the CEO
didn't want to have conversations at the
 
didn't want to have conversations at the
executive level about refresh grants
 
executive level about refresh grants
until people were fully vested and he
 
until people were fully vested and he
felt really strong like it's a four-year
 
felt really strong like it's a four-year
contract I I made a contract with you
 
contract I I made a contract with you
and I will talk to you about it again at
 
and I will talk to you about it again at
the end now if you have a key executive
 
the end now if you have a key executive
that has a lot of you know that places a
 
that has a lot of you know that places a
lot of negotiating leverage in their
 
lot of negotiating leverage in their
hands at the time that that contract is
 
hands at the time that that contract is
up for negotiation again so it's a
 
up for negotiation again so it's a
little bit of a trade-off right on the
 
little bit of a trade-off right on the
one hand you're sort of able to go years
 
one hand you're sort of able to go years
before you're touching like pretty
 
before you're touching like pretty
expensive refresh GRS and on the other
 
expensive refresh GRS and on the other
hand you're sort of one counting on that
 
hand you're sort of one counting on that
person to stick around and if they're
 
person to stick around and if they're
vit to the business like you're really
 
vit to the business like you're really
you know putting a lot of negotiating
 
you know putting a lot of negotiating
leverage into their hands to really
 
leverage into their hands to really
fight for something that might be even
 
fight for something that might be even
higher than what Market you know you
 
higher than what Market you know you
talk about what Market is it's like
 
talk about what Market is it's like
really what am I worth to you if I walk
 
really what am I worth to you if I walk
out the door and I'm able to do that and
 
out the door and I'm able to do that and
so you know I think it's important to to
 
so you know I think it's important to to
sort of put that into perspective too
 
sort of put that into perspective too
yeah I mean I appreciate the the
 
yeah I mean I appreciate the the
fortitude and perseverance of it
 
fortitude and perseverance of it
actually I mean it you know depends on
 
actually I mean it you know depends on
the company but I I'd love your ear
 
the company but I I'd love your ear
guys' thoughts because I've gone to the
 
guys' thoughts because I've gone to the
mat on what I think is a pretty old
 
mat on what I think is a pretty old
school hey we're not going to give
 
school hey we're not going to give
refresh grants until three or four years
 
refresh grants until three or four years
and for the best people I mean you're
 
and for the best people I mean you're
you're not necessarily giving grants but
 
you're not necessarily giving grants but
you're looking at everyone who's greater
 
you're looking at everyone who's greater
than 50% vested which would you know
 
than 50% vested which would you know
lead to a two-year right every every two
 
lead to a two-year right every every two
years if you're phenomenal maybe they're
 
years if you're phenomenal maybe they're
not as big but I just think it's really
 
not as big but I just think it's really
important and I think that three-year
 
important and I think that three-year
mark it just
 
mark it just
causes you know complacency and just
 
causes you know complacency and just
this this risk and back in the in the
 
this this risk and back in the in the
bull market it was like everyone got a
 
bull market it was like everyone got a
nominal refresh Grant at three years so
 
nominal refresh Grant at three years so
if you were okay you got a refresh Grant
 
if you were okay you got a refresh Grant
if you were great you got a refresh
 
if you were great you got a refresh
Grant at three years and I just think
 
Grant at three years and I just think
it's Insanity yeah well actually going
 
it's Insanity yeah well actually going
back to our report we asked about when
 
back to our report we asked about when
employees are first eligible for a
 
employees are first eligible for a
refresh Grant and another big surprise

and programs we looked into this and one
of the the reasons we decided against it
 
of the the reasons we decided against it
was it was hard to think about fairness
 
was it was hard to think about fairness
like if somebody you know comes in and
 
like if somebody you know comes in and
like chooses more equity and then that
 
like chooses more equity and then that
Equity goes way up and maybe they could
 
Equity goes way up and maybe they could
take lower cash it's it was hard for us
 
take lower cash it's it was hard for us
to think about fairness at the time but
 
to think about fairness at the time but
I think we've moved into a world that is
 
I think we've moved into a world that is
more accepting of these sorts of
 
more accepting of these sorts of
delineations it's like well they made
 
delineations it's like well they made
that choice you didn't and people are
 
that choice you didn't and people are
okay with that yeah I think I think
 
okay with that yeah I think I think
there's that there's also so you know
 
there's that there's also so you know
some I think support that there it
 
some I think support that there it
disproportionately impacts you know

your interview with Michelle D Camry
 
your interview with Michelle D Camry
from fisis is that most companies don't
 
from fisis is that most companies don't
track that it happens so the Savvy thing
 
track that it happens so the Savvy thing
to do is to take the higher equity and

be or I'm at the lower end of your
 
be or I'm at the lower end of your
ranges and I'm one of your high
 
ranges and I'm one of your high
performers and then I'll you know and
 
performers and then I'll you know and
then there'll be like a
 
then there'll be like a
correction and then you'll really get
 
correction and then you'll really get
the upside of both and I think generally
 
the upside of both and I think generally
the way we advise our portfolio
 
the way we advise our portfolio
companies when they're thinking about

doing a trade-off is to do either a one
for one here's $10,000 more in lie of
 
for one here's $10,000 more in lie of
sort of equal value and Equity or to
 
sort of equal value and Equity or to
place some you know again if they're ear
 
place some you know again if they're ear
especially if they're early stage it's
 
especially if they're early stage it's
maybe more appropriate to place some
 
maybe more appropriate to place some
discount against the the equity and say
 
discount against the the equity and say
like I'll give you 10,000 for like
 
like I'll give you 10,000 for like
$15,000 worth of stock or whatever yeah
 
$15,000 worth of stock or whatever yeah

it was a steep learning curve and so I I
 
it was a steep learning curve and so I I
did what I you know knew best is just be
 
did what I you know knew best is just be
really curious go and really try and
 
really curious go and really try and
understand the problem set at the end of
 
understand the problem set at the end of
the day I'm really sort of passionate
 
the day I'm really sort of passionate
about root cause problem solving and
 
about root cause problem solving and
what was really clear is that amongst
 
what was really clear is that amongst
our employees and even amongst our
 
our employees and even amongst our
executive team there was just a lot of
 
executive team there was just a lot of
dissatisfaction with our compensation
 
dissatisfaction with our compensation
approach and it really came down to it
 
approach and it really came down to it
wasn't really codified articulated there
 
wasn't really codified articulated there
wasn't consistency around it and
 
wasn't consistency around it and
probably most critically when we looked
 
probably most critically when we looked
when I sort of asked our team to pull
 
when I sort of asked our team to pull
together the numbers for me there was a
 
together the numbers for me there was a
lot of ad hoc compensation decisions
 
lot of ad hoc compensation decisions
that were being made at extraordinarily
 
that were being made at extraordinarily
more expensive rates than would have
 
more expensive rates than would have
been if they were done programmatically
 
been if they were done programmatically
right so if you look like Delta Dem Mark
 
right so if you look like Delta Dem Mark
I mean I think we're were spending like
 
I mean I think we're were spending like
 
have or or however you want to describe
 
have or or however you want to describe
it um because we were just making sort
 
it um because we were just making sort
of you know ad hoc random compensation
 
of you know ad hoc random compensation
decisions so there was sort of this ven
 
decisions so there was sort of this ven
diagram of you know stakeholders that
 
diagram of you know stakeholders that
were interested in streamlining some of
 
were interested in streamlining some of
this and and coming together on it and
 
this and and coming together on it and

is that there was real like Divergence
 
is that there was real like Divergence
of opinions on the leadership team
 
of opinions on the leadership team
around that compensation philosophy and

from the harder parts of that the the
 
from the harder parts of that the the
beauty in it was around enlisting their
 
beauty in it was around enlisting their

talking about this about hr's ownership
 
talking about this about hr's ownership
and this is a perfect example of
 
and this is a perfect example of
something that we own the delivery of
 
something that we own the delivery of
and we potentially own how you know like
 
and we potentially own how you know like
the the machine machine in which the
 
the the machine machine in which the
sausage is made but like the actual like
 
sausage is made but like the actual like
sausage thing is actually being

state to where you know the employees
 
state to where you know the employees
understand it and they understand the
 
understand it and they understand the
trade-offs that we made but like HR
 
trade-offs that we made but like HR
didn't design comp and if you fall into
 
didn't design comp and if you fall into
that bucket which I have mistakenly
 
that bucket which I have mistakenly
fallen into in my career at least from a
 
fallen into in my career at least from a
branding standpoint
 
branding standpoint
and if you get branded as well HR did
 
and if you get branded as well HR did
this then what's going to happen is is
 
this then what's going to happen is is
every single time you know a comp cycle
 
every single time you know a comp cycle
comes up then the manager is going to
 
comes up then the manager is going to
point to HR and be like sorry you got
 
point to HR and be like sorry you got
your comp because HR decided this
 
your comp because HR decided this
easyest scapegoat I think that I I fell
 
easyest scapegoat I think that I I fell
into it too I made so many mistakes and
 
into it too I made so many mistakes and
I use the exact word I was going to use
 
I use the exact word I was going to use
which I can't believe you know we agreed
 
which I can't believe you know we agreed
on something it is the word facilitation
 
on something it is the word facilitation
and I was like I don't I don't own RTO
 
and I was like I don't I don't own RTO
people I own the facilitation of the
 
people I own the facilitation of the
process to which we want to get but it's
 
process to which we want to get but it's
we and I think that is it's easy trapped

to fall into especially when you're
younger in your career you know what I
 
younger in your career you know what I

it is we did bring in external Partners
 
it is we did bring in external Partners
but we wrapped it in our own DNA so I
 
but we wrapped it in our own DNA so I
pulled on those same leaders VP of
 
pulled on those same leaders VP of
engineering you know I think our VP of

going to Cobble it together and and I
 
going to Cobble it together and and I
you know I'm really happy with the

relationships oh yes yeah because he he
can't he can't discount you because
 
can't he can't discount you because
you've done both jobs so well I mean he
 
you've done both jobs so well I mean he
can do whatever he wants to do but we'll
 
can do whatever he wants to do but we'll
find out but no first tell me what it is
 
find out but no first tell me what it is
that has frustrated you or left you with
 
that has frustrated you or left you with
this sort of impression yeah so I think
 
this sort of impression yeah so I think
look it it's not always the case but I
 
look it it's not always the case but I
would say the overwhelming population of
 
would say the overwhelming population of
lawyers is the party of no and it's we
 
lawyers is the party of no and it's we
can't do this because
 
can't do this because
versus I hear what you're saying and
 
versus I hear what you're saying and
what I think you mean is this and that's
 
what I think you mean is this and that's
how we can go do that that's what a
 
how we can go do that that's what a
really good lawyer does but I think
 
really good lawyer does but I think
actually like finding those people with
 
actually like finding those people with
a business mindset is very challenging
 
a business mindset is very challenging
and I think there's a similar branding
 
and I think there's a similar branding
