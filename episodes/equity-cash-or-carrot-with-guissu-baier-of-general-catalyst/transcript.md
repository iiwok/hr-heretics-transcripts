what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics gesu it's
a first timer welcome to the show thank
you so much for having me I'm really
excited so glad to have you giz this is
going to be so fun and I want to get
into your very unique background here in
a second
but I want to lead off with General
Catalyst which is where you currently
work you guys just launched an equity
refresh survey and I want you to tell
our audience about the key findings of
that survey yes I would be happy to so I
lead a a fairly new and unique practice
at GC on the executive Talent team that
we call people advisory and insights and
so the equity refresh survey is one of
our products on the Insight side big
shout out to Grant revas who's hopefully
listening to this episode on my team and
has been instrumental and helping us
stand up this practice really the
objective for us is to help our
companies navigate business critical
people practices and some of that comes
through you know experience and
expertise and you know here's what I've
lived and here's what our community says
but we really Endeavor to back up as
much of our Guidance with data as we can
and we don't really want to replicate
what's already out there we're so lucky
that our friends that Norwest and light
spe and so many other firms are are open
sourcing and Publishing their reports
that we synthesize a lot of those and
then where we see gaps in the data we
will once or twice a year conduct
surveys ourselves so this Equity refresh
report is the one that we took on this
year and frankly designing it told me a
lot about why nobody has really done
this before because asking the questions
in a right way was was really
challenging and and I really wanted
thank so many people including guests
that you've had on this show for helping
us with designing that and then getting
it out there so to your question on key
findings the the purpose of this survey
was really to talk about the design so
this isn't supposed to be like a
benchmarking report of you know what
percentage Equity refresh to give to
employees but really more about how
companies today are constructing their
Equity refresh programs and the findings
I found to be really interesting
especially given sort of my history and
experience designing programs like this
at startups and the main one that I
would sort of highlight is that it's
really clear that the macroeconomic
climate is impacting the way companies
are issuing followon grants and refresh
grants so they're definitely being more
judicious about equity delution and
really focusing on retaining top
performers so you know
 
prioritize refresh grants for in based
on individual performance when we talked
about eligibility performance was really
highly rated as a factor that was in
there and I want to contrast that from
you know the era of like not to say
Company still don't have like the box
car model or or whatever the wealth
front model of you know here's everybody
get something because they're here and
and you know they've hadit a 10year
milestone this to me is a departure from
where we have been where refresh is
typically and I use the word typically
really Loosely because I don't think
there is a typical having sort of
studied this but there really is this
focus on performance in a way that is a
departure from how refresh grants in
particular have been handled so that was
that was like a major takeaway um and
then the others were really around the
calculation and the terms so really
focusing on a just a fraction of what a
new higher Grant uh is in terms of what
the size of the grant is and again you
know there have been debates around like
well you know at three years or four
years if you're granting refreshes then
should you fully rehire someone should
you give them fully what they've
received before I mean that would be
very generous and believe me I've had
companies advocate for that companies
have taken that position it's highly
dilutive obviously and completely
disregards the sort of upside value of
that new higher Grant so really we were
able to put some data behind you know
being thoughtful about who you're
spending spending it on how much you're
spending it and then I think the other
interesting thing was like almost half
did not have a vesting Cliff so 47% had
no vesting Cliff that was also an
interesting insight into the way that
companies are structuring refresh grants
compared to to new higher grants so my
take on this is like I would have
expected cash to be more conservative
given the new macro environment and C
has actually pushed out data recently
that says like that's not the case like
cash is not really coming down and
Equity is and yet most companies have
valuations probably still to this point
that might be out of whack towards the
highend and so what is causing the
microscope to be put on Equity right now
yeah well I do think you know managing
that that cap table and managing that
Equity pool you know think
about I think companies when they
thinking they're thinking about Runway
they're thinking about their cash Runway
but they also have a Runway when it
comes to their Equity pool because
otherwise they have to go back to their
investors and expand the pool and really
justify why they're doing that when
they're facing a number of other
headwinds so you know I was always
taught in sort of startup comp land to
treat Equity the same as cash which is
not the way many companies at least you
know many years ago thought about it
they thought about it as this like free
thing that they can give out and you
know it is worth nothing thing early on
in the company's history but once it
really does have have and I'll be
careful not to use the word tangible
value because obviously there's issues
around liquidity and and the point you
raised around valuation but once it
starts to have more sort of value to it
it really in my opinion is important to
treat it as carefully as cash and to
really help people understand what the
value of that is so you know I I think
investors are scrutinizing requests to
expand option pools as much as they are
ISR izing operating expenses and if
companies are waiting longer before
their next fund raise or having
challenges ahead of their next fundraise
you know they're they're try trying to
be careful about what do they need in
order to hire key talent and of course
retain Talent too totally totally agree
I mean expanding the pool in hard times
like this especially if you have a
bloated valuation is dangerous right I
mean and so I think I think that the
scrutiny on that makes total sense just
from experience gesu did you see in your
survey based on all of that kind of
refresh grants with maybe shorter
vesting schedules shorter grants to help
with that interestingly the vesting
periods that were most common were just
over four years still and you know I
think at the end of the day and I think
this is where it's tricky too because
companies use equity in different ways
sometimes it's in lie of having bonus
plans for example or really trying to
make up for lower cash although I I
think that's been happening less I've
been noticing that like it's not as
common to sort of make up for the lower
cash offer in in sort of that same way
that I I felt like was the case maybe
you know SE six years ago but it still
is a long-term incentive tool so like
cash is the short-term play and Equity
is the longterm play so you know I think
that explains why you still want that
four-year time Horizon but I think the
of that Cliff gives a little bit more
recognition to the fact that you're a
known quantity and that you know we're
not going to make you wait a year to
vest into this Equity you're somebody
that we want and we want to keep here
and so you know we're not going to place
that cliff on it that that I thought was
was sort of more reflective of of that
recognition of it being different than
for a new hire yeah we had that
discussion at Carta actually with the
cliff and you know obviously the board
is going to push to include the cliff on
the refresh program and the reason why
is because if somebody departs then that
that Equity goes back into the pool and
they're less deluded our take was like
that's not the right thing to do they've
already been here making them wait with
more golden handcuffs I think could
actually lead to poor behaviors so like
they're just sitting in the seat waiting
until their next vesting date and that's
where we landed as like no Cliff
refreshes but I do want to just quickly
take a minute on on performance and so
you're saying hey almost every everybody
now when they do a refresh Grant is
thinking about performance and I think
that's great I've seen this phenomenon
in recruiting to
where you know everyone says we want to
pay for performance yet we extend
significantly for the new hire and yet
for somebody who is a proven quantity
you would just set it of like when they
get to their third or fourth year should
we give them a new Grant as if they were
a new hire isn't the answer obviously
yes like we have data on them like
interviews are completely
imperfect and yet we continue to index
on hiring as opposed to investing in in
the existing talent that we have so this
is my soap box which I will gently step
off of now but I'm curious to get your
take in what you see given the aperture
that you have yeah I mean look I I love
to sort of we know we got to reason from
first principles here and so there
there's definitely a rational argument
to be made of look isn't this person's
alternative to go and get another
fouryear grand somewhere else and fully
get rehired somewhere else like what is
stopping them from doing that and why
wouldn't we do the same for them that
that another company is willing to do so
I mean a couple of things one especially
in a bold Talent
Market you know the the desperation
leads to a lot of you know extreme
behaviors and so I think there's just a
lot more of attention and and unknown
quantities on both sides right it's not
just is the employee you know you're
really hungry for that Talent you really
desperate to have them and then on the
flip side for the employee the employee
like I don't know you you know is your
culture going to be someplace I really
want to work is this going to be the
place I really want to spend my time and
and so I think just from a negotiating
leverage standpoint that new higher
Grant it doesn't surprise me that those
continue to be sort of targeted higher
if you're extracting someone from
another very compelling opportunity
there's just a lot there that explains
why there's a premium placed on that on
your point around around sort of follow
on and refresh grants I think
look if you were to follow that logic of
like oh well we should you know
completely rehire this person because we
value them that much it completely
places it zero their existing Holdings
and I think like when we were
constructing some of this instacar when
we were thinking about our refresh
grants we had a lot of debate around it
and there was a lot of discussion around
like oh well is this person you know
this person has like a ton of equity
it's okay that their cash is like so
much lower than everyone else or well
well that person's not super vested in
their Equity so like how you know how
should we be thinking about that and so
I think what it solves for is that
largely you do want people playing for
their new higher grants and this goes
for executives too the majority of their
value is in their new higher grants and
so you really want people to like treat
that as like not zero right and to
really think about like building on the
value of that initially and then yes
like continued recognition having you
know carrots in front of them you know
as you're on this longer term Sprint
like it makes sense to continue to reup
it but you know in the era that I was in
instacart this was at a different
company was before it was public it was
still a founder-led business the CEO
didn't want to have conversations at the
executive level about refresh grants
until people were fully vested and he
felt really strong like it's a four-year
contract I I made a contract with you
and I will talk to you about it again at
the end now if you have a key executive
that has a lot of you know that places a
lot of negotiating leverage in their
hands at the time that that contract is
up for negotiation again so it's a
little bit of a trade-off right on the
one hand you're sort of able to go years
before you're touching like pretty
expensive refresh GRS and on the other
hand you're sort of one counting on that
person to stick around and if they're
vit to the business like you're really
you know putting a lot of negotiating
leverage into their hands to really
fight for something that might be even
higher than what Market you know you
talk about what Market is it's like
really what am I worth to you if I walk
out the door and I'm able to do that and
so you know I think it's important to to
sort of put that into perspective too
yeah I mean I appreciate the the
fortitude and perseverance of it
actually I mean it you know depends on
the company but I I'd love your ear
guys' thoughts because I've gone to the
mat on what I think is a pretty old
school hey we're not going to give
refresh grants until three or four years
and for the best people I mean you're
you're not necessarily giving grants but
you're looking at everyone who's greater
than 50% vested which would you know
lead to a two-year right every every two
years if you're phenomenal maybe they're
not as big but I just think it's really
important and I think that three-year
mark it just
causes you know complacency and just
this this risk and back in the in the
bull market it was like everyone got a
nominal refresh Grant at three years so
if you were okay you got a refresh Grant
if you were great you got a refresh
Grant at three years and I just think
it's Insanity yeah well actually going
back to our report we asked about when
employees are first eligible for a
refresh Grant and another big surprise
was that actually one to two years was
more typical then the threeyear plus
which like I said was more what I was

minutes now the the other side of that
coin gesu right is eligible does not it
was really really Pro some people are
Discerning have really picked up on that
and that's really key because because
performance is such a factor it's really
hard to ask like when are you actually
doing this I mean also just frankly
becomes a really long survey that people
don't want to answer so we were trying
to optimize for Simplicity as well as as
getting insights that we were looking
for so you know again I found it 78% of
companies all employees with two years
of tenure or less are eligible for their
first refresh Grant and then of those
 
for subsequent subsequent subsequent
refresh grants annually so that's also a
bit of a know some of our investors are
like well hold on a second does that
mean everybody's getting refreshed
annually after the first two years and
I'm like that is true for top performers
so if you're still in that bucket of top
performer you might end up getting
annual refreshes thereafter and you
might not some years you do some years
you don't so I think it's just it's way
more nuanced and less formulaic than
what people were used to and so it's a
little you know it's also a little bit
hard to explain and that thing but there
is no standard there is no standard on
that that's what I've been learning as
as we did this at Carta we we asked for
a huge increase to the pool which was I
found very controversial with our board
at the time and I learned about that
process but when we were trying to get
data on this that there just isn't data
and so so Kelly I want to make sure I
heard what you said are were you
advocating that employees were not
eligible for refresh grants until after
their second year of employment I I was
advocating that ref fresh Grant
eligibility yes 50% or more vested to to
take a look at not necessarily Grant but
to take a look at versus versus 75% or
more versus 75 or 100% which is what I
was seen so I was
seeing every steady Edie at 75% vested
get something I was like H you know
let's actually make it that not everyone
gets something the best people people
get it at 50% sooner you're compounding
them over time you're locking them in on
that future value that's building on
each other and it was helpful for the
investors to hear that you know it's
zero some game we're not changing the
total we're just allocating it
differently you know for for better
acceleration of the business and
retention of the best talent don't you
think you can get signal on the best
talent within 12 months of course you
can oh you're saying it's should be
sooner all in yeah okay so that's great
but why would you I'm trying to Lo like
I be this is my point around I see so
much this desire to lean on recruiting
and to go spend on recruiting when I
think actually what we should be doing
if we truly believe in paying for
performance is potentially being more
competitive on the cash side in
recruiting and less competitive in
equity and using Equity as the lever to
really lock in our people that's like
you know my diet tribe and how I would
go about building these things and doing
it on an annual Cadence because I want
my best people to feel true ownership
and that's what you see right at the
Googles at the you know most public
companies have an annual look which is
which is great I just you know my
personal point of view Nolan is at early
stage companies where where you've got
folks coming I don't think it's
necessary
to dilute the cap table and give equity
to folks that have been there for a year
cash yes blah blah blah but I just I
don't think it's necessary and I'm not
sure it's enough time to give half of a
new high Grant to someone who just got a
four-year thing now anomalies happen or
like we're quarter maybe you're saying
it's a quarter a year in or something
like that I think the other thing look
like when I when I first had to take on
like when I joined instacart or when I
took on the VP of HR role there I didn't
know anything about any of this stuff
quite frankly and so I've come at this
and what I heard a lot of from people
who asserted themselves as experts
mostly Engineers who' worked at a bunch
of different companies is they were like
they're like here's how it's here's how
it's done let me tell you how it's done
since you clearly don't know what you're
doing it's not just with Equity gesu
it's every part of HR it's done and and
and Nolan when I did investigate this
and I went and I did research because
look I am a former lawyer so I apply
these skills right to go and I'm like
okay well let me see is this true let me
validate these assumptions and the truth
is that nobody there was no singular way
despite the articles about wealth front
I actually really appreciate that Carta
has since published theirs which I found
to be really interesting and helpful
there is no singular way and actually
most companies don't even have a
proactive strategy around it they're
doing sorts of stuff they're like oh oh
this person's like about to leave like
let me go and like like give them some
more Equity based on nothing you know
don't really have a an overall strategy
and might I add like real quick like not
only because I think a lot of people
have impostor syndome around Equity like
you know you're like and everyone's like
everyone knows what they're doing I
don't know what it really H like no one
really has the perfect thing and then
because they don't know they spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars
bringing in compensia to tell them what
to do and you know what compensia says
well it depends okay friends with
compensia so no no compensia is great
I'm just saying I'm I'm joking I know
but I know I've worked with compensia
for years I'm just saying like they will
also say well there's a bunch of
different ways to do it depends on your
so I'm just trying to give the audience
some confidence that you might be well
okay so on yeah smarter around this than
you think yeah and on that on that point
let's just let's put some data behind it
because I think when we get kind of
caught up in like oh this seems like
rational and let's like this makes sense
let's do it that way like let's actually
put some data around it you all have put
looked at these numbers I think CA
published them too that the average
tenure for an employee at a startup is
two years so you know to to Kelly's
point if if that person is more likely
than not to be leaving at the two-year
Mark anyway kind of like regardless of
you know I guess your thesis has to
believe that there's a higher likelihood
that they wouldn't leave at two years
and go diversify their port folio if you
granted it to them sooner which by the
way also would create a spike in their
overall comp if you look at it as their
comp like the bar graph it creates a
significant spike in their comp in years
two and year three if you start to Grant
things right away and so you're making
them more valuable and expensive I guess
you're making them more expensive in
year two by doing
that and you know there's a PR there's a
pretty good chance that you may not even
need them in a year from now just
because the pace of the company is
changing so much it's a different
company this is top performers I I'm
only talking about like the top 10% I
don't think the top 10% has that much
variance every year and so I I hear you
and I agree with you but I would say
that like for the top 10% to your point
we have data that they mostly leave
every 18 to 24 months and that is the
nightmare situation from a talent
management standpoint is that we want to
lock in our best people and and to your
your earlier Point around being reactive
which is exactly right most companies
are entirely reactive this is how you
lock people in this is how you say like
yay we only do this for a small
percentage of our population you are you
are now eligible for that this year and
we want to thank you for doing
everything that you can to help this
company succeed here's more ownership to
lock you in that's where I think like no
one does that well and I think that's
going to be part of the future of how we
manage tallenge I I was going to say one
way to think about that too that I've
thought about love maybe both your
opinions on that is to lock people
people in but if you're going to do that
at at the one-ear Mark apply the oneyear
cliff in this case so you lock them in
at the at the 409a at that date then
it's the one-year cliff and then you
avoid that Spike why give the cliff
though there it's vesting monthly
anyways and if they leave it returns to
the pool like you're just handcuffing
them I I also feel like we're a little
tomato tomato right now just be
honest I I disagree I mean I've spent I
was at car so I spent a lot of time
thinking about this the the comp
consultant thing though just to quote
the late great Charlie Munger I would
rather throw a Viper down my shirt than
hire a compensation consultant was his
famous saying oh it's it's the I died
when I first heard this it's an
incredible quote I actually do believe
in leveraging com Consultants so me and
Charlie what was the reason why why a
Viper what was in the spirit of like our
profession and Industry there are
definitely things that are left to be
desired in in that area for sure Nolan I
this is sort of like a I'm not trying to
split the baby on this or anything but
there isn't anything that really stops a
company from doing the thing that you're
talking about so just to take like a
further step back our survey first of
all our survey is not geared towards
executive p and it certainly we did ask
questions about sort of spot grants
which I really think is is the tool or
the vehicle through which you can
accomplish some of what you're talking
about if it really is like a top five
percenter that you know a top 10
percenter that that you're you have a
different vehicle it's not your
programat
refresh Grant it's even more targeted
and specific than that so for example I
mean even until I think the current CEO
came on at instacart instacart didn't
have a cash bonus program we were very
heavily reliant on our equity and
started to get a little bit more you
know top a market around cash as we were
competing against public companies for
talent but you know a lot of the
criticism of our refresh program when we
rolled it out was there's just not
enough differentiation for performance
and you know we did have a backloaded
structure it was a pretty novel
structure that we rolled out and sort of
communicated to the team and the
solution that we were evaluating was
like fine then like let's have basically
a bonus program using our Equity as a
bonus program and you can do exactly
what you're talking about you can have
it Grant you can have it vest
immediately if you want so that you're
basically using your equity in two ways
one as a long-term thing and then as
another as sort of a substitute for a
short-term sort of incen
I like that I wouldn't do it as a spot I
would do it as part of the broader
program this is just me in my bias
towards top performers because as
somebody who grew up in recruiting I see
it all the time we forget about our
talent that is actually delivering high
performance today and just believe that
you know person XYZ that we're talking
to in the interview process is going to
be this magical performer and you know
 
performer or somebody that we manage out
and in just very rare cases they end up
being a top performer so again off my
soap box I do want to talk about my my
two last thoughts on Equity just to just
to wrap this up then yeah is is I don't
think in especially larger earlier stage
companies I don't think the recruiting
ranges and how that works for new hires
is as connected as it should be with the
refresh ranges in the talent management
space you know what I mean those are
usually two different worlds and I do
think that they should be more connected
which I think is CA causing a little bit
of this um and secondly like I I thought
of this years ago and I still haven't
seen it but the element of choice I
think it's very interesting um choice
between cash or Equity Choice as far as
risk for war with Equity I mean I know
it's it's administratively more complex
Etc but I think like a menu of choice
around cash versus equity and then
within the equity bucket is very
interesting I think it's coming too
Kelly I think that's going to be part of
the next iteration of people thinking
about novel compensation philosophies
and programs we looked into this and one
of the the reasons we decided against it
was it was hard to think about fairness
like if somebody you know comes in and
like chooses more equity and then that
Equity goes way up and maybe they could
take lower cash it's it was hard for us
to think about fairness at the time but
I think we've moved into a world that is
more accepting of these sorts of
delineations it's like well they made
that choice you didn't and people are
okay with that yeah I think I think
there's that there's also so you know
some I think support that there it
disproportionately impacts you know
either women or people from
underrepresented backgrounds that may
not sort of be as risk tolerant as as
others I don't think it's a reason not
to do it I think in general having
agency over your choices is the
direction people industry is going you
see a lot more around customizable
benefits and pick and choose the menu it
certainly is Administrative headache the
main thing and I think this came up in
your interview with Michelle D Camry
from fisis is that most companies don't
track that it happens so the Savvy thing
to do is to take the higher equity and
then in a year be like why is my cash so
low like I'm totally off of your you
know of your ranges or whatever it may
be or I'm at the lower end of your
ranges and I'm one of your high
performers and then I'll you know and
then there'll be like a
correction and then you'll really get
the upside of both and I think generally
the way we advise our portfolio
companies when they're thinking about
doing a trade-off is to do either a one
for one here's $10,000 more in lie of
sort of equal value and Equity or to
place some you know again if they're ear
especially if they're early stage it's
maybe more appropriate to place some
discount against the the equity and say
like I'll give you 10,000 for like
$15,000 worth of stock or whatever yeah
it this is I think an area that has a
ton of room for people to innovate on
and I don't think they actually know it
and and this is what I mean is like
everyone thinks about this differently
and it is bespoke and so this is an area
when you can get deep alignment with
your leadership team to do something
novel and cool that other companies
aren't doing and so with that I giz you
you know you at instacart you know it
sounds like you have a little story
about a a contentious Compensation
Program design can you tell us about
that story yes I'm happy to so look when
I stepped into the role of leading HR at
instacart I was coming over from those
legal team and I'm happy to share a
little bit more of that Journey if it's
interesting to anybody but like I said
it was a steep learning curve and so I I
did what I you know knew best is just be
really curious go and really try and
understand the problem set at the end of
the day I'm really sort of passionate
about root cause problem solving and
what was really clear is that amongst
our employees and even amongst our
executive team there was just a lot of
dissatisfaction with our compensation
approach and it really came down to it
wasn't really codified articulated there
wasn't consistency around it and
probably most critically when we looked
when I sort of asked our team to pull
together the numbers for me there was a
lot of ad hoc compensation decisions
that were being made at extraordinarily
more expensive rates than would have
been if they were done programmatically
right so if you look like Delta Dem Mark
I mean I think we're were spending like
 
have or or however you want to describe
it um because we were just making sort
of you know ad hoc random compensation
decisions so there was sort of this ven
diagram of you know stakeholders that
were interested in streamlining some of
this and and coming together on it and
so what I what I quickly realized though
is that there was real like Divergence
of opinions on the leadership team
around that compensation philosophy and
I really put myself kind of squarely in
the middle of trying to broker a
compromise between honestly what felt
like Democrats and Republicans like this
was my our like releasing our
compensation philosophy in front of the
whole company after 9 months in you know
nine months is a lifetime in in startup
land it took nine months to get from
okay we're gonna do this to we're ready
to get in front of the company and and
roll this out it was like my bar
bipartisan Bill like my bipartisan bill
was was bringing to the world you know
this this agreement between you know
really pretty extreme views on our
leadership team around what this should
look like and it was you know I could
have just come in and be like this is
what the CEO wants to do this is what
we're going to do you know or you know I
you know I probably should have removed
myself at some point and said okay you
should go in this room and and Duke this
out and let me know where you land just
just tell me what you decide but I was
really committed to delivering you know
you give me a goal and I'm going to go
I'm going to go deliver it that's sort
of my you give me something to do I'm
going to go do it and I'm going to
deliver and I I wasn't really willing to
separate my own success from from
helping them see alignment with each
other but I think sort of stepping away
from the harder parts of that the the
beauty in it was around enlisting their
participation in rolling out the
strategy so our VP of data science
co-presented the presentation with me
ourc CEO kicked it off our you know VP
of engineering was also really heavily
involved and rolling out the
communications and we C every single
word on the slide was something that we
all stacked hands on together and we
collaborated on together even coming up
with sort of clever you know names that
were like uniquely instacart a slice of
the pie and all of that fun stuff that
brings us back to our kind of cultural
heritage and I think at the end of the
day it certainly didn't feel like HR
initiative that was ruled out it was a
company initiative and it was something
that they all collectively were really
proud of too and then when there was
criticism about it because there was oh
why isn't this performance oriented
enough and there you know that was a
shared there was like a shared
discussion around that it wasn't like
you didn't think about that why why
don't we have that soled Bravo giz I
mean I I think that is one of the most
brilliant yet simplest like things that
we can do as HR leaders is co-present
right get get other leaders to talk
about this put their figureprints I I
can't tell you how many times I've used
it and I'm like listen you got me into
this we're gonna we're gonna get each
other out of this so it it just works
it's Bravo well Kelly we we were just
talking about this about hr's ownership
and this is a perfect example of
something that we own the delivery of
and we potentially own how you know like
the the machine machine in which the
sausage is made but like the actual like
sausage thing is actually being
controlled by the business and and so
we're trying to help facilitate the
conversation and then we're trying to
help like deliver the program at the end
state to where you know the employees
understand it and they understand the
trade-offs that we made but like HR
didn't design comp and if you fall into
that bucket which I have mistakenly
fallen into in my career at least from a
branding standpoint
and if you get branded as well HR did
this then what's going to happen is is
every single time you know a comp cycle
comes up then the manager is going to
point to HR and be like sorry you got
your comp because HR decided this
easyest scapegoat I think that I I fell
into it too I made so many mistakes and
I use the exact word I was going to use
which I can't believe you know we agreed
on something it is the word facilitation
and I was like I don't I don't own RTO
people I own the facilitation of the
process to which we want to get but it's
we and I think that is it's easy trapped
to fall into especially when you're
younger in your career you know what I
mean and you want to add value and you
want to do well and you have these
powerful boys who were yelling scream
like it's a very easy trap to fall into
so I'm gonna get comments now they are
men they are
 
men no I think that word facilitation it
but it's it's a really underestimated
skill set it's a really diff it's not an
easy thing to do especially look when
you report to the CEO and the CEO is the
CEO you you also need to be working with
leaders that are really looking to have
that level of alignment I'll give you
one more example because it's probably
one of my favorite examples of this sort
of radical collaboration with the
executive team I think Talent
Development was another area that was
really clearly in need when I took over
the function and I basically came
forward with this I I came forward with
this strategy was like here's what I
think we should do here's why I think we
should do it sort of how I think we
should like for each sort of like the
dimensions of the people function after
having been in the seat for a couple
months I'm like here's my road map you
know do you want to do this or not and
you know one of the key things was that
managers are forced multipliers within
our organizations if you want to drive
performance and productivity it's really
important to shore up our our bench here
it's not a perk it is a business
imperative and you know that was that
really resonated and the CEO was super
excited to kick it off and he's like
basically I was like here's no budget
and I don't want to bring in anyone
externally cuz that's never going to
feel like us and and then oh yeah I I
like this cohort idea that you're
working on but do it twice as fast so be
done with everyone in like six months I
was like so again you know because I was
new I was like okay yeah sounds good let
me but we did and the way we solved for
it is we did bring in external Partners
but we wrapped it in our own DNA so I
pulled on those same leaders VP of
engineering you know I think our VP of
data science came and talked about
unconscious bias because that was
something he was really enthusiastic
about our product leader came in and
talked about our business flywheel
someone on our our finance leader on our
team came and talked about how to read a
p&amp;l because it's really important for
our leaders to understand how to do that
so we really kind of designed the
wrapper around our manager and
Leadership training that we called
recipes for leadership with with those
leaders coming in and sharing in their
own Journeys about their own leadership
growth and also just topics that were
really important to them and then I mean
it became this strangely competitive
thing where some of them would be like
oh you know you didn't invite me to come
and speak at the at the you know but
like nobody before talked about manager
training this positive everybody thinks
about it as like the compliance two
hours sexual harassment training that I
have to do they don't think about it as
this thing but we really kind of branded
it as a special they got a special
invitation from the CEO handpicked by
leaders from from the organization and
then led by Executives whom they didn't
have as much proximity to as they would
have liked so it just created this
really kind of unique experience and
some of that was born out of being
resource constrainted because I was like
I don't have talent management like I
don't know exactly how to do this and so
here's what we're going to do we're
going to Cobble it together and and I
you know I'm really happy with the
outcome and it happens to be something
that still lives today even where we're
instr is today again the power of
branding and brining Executives gesu I I
do want to ask you because I I was like
very hyper about this on the prep I love
your background I think it's so cool and
interesting and you just went over from
the legal side nailed the people role
and I just want to know like one how
that transition was and then two you
know we talk about lawyers in the show
and noan likes to throw them under the
bus and say they're hard to work with
like what do you what what do you think
about the lawyer C HR relationship and
maybe since you were on both sides of
the fence there like what do you
appreciate or maybe not appreciate more
about about those working
relationships oh yes yeah because he he
can't he can't discount you because
you've done both jobs so well I mean he
can do whatever he wants to do but we'll
find out but no first tell me what it is
that has frustrated you or left you with
this sort of impression yeah so I think
look it it's not always the case but I
would say the overwhelming population of
lawyers is the party of no and it's we
can't do this because
versus I hear what you're saying and
what I think you mean is this and that's
how we can go do that that's what a
really good lawyer does but I think
actually like finding those people with
a business mindset is very challenging
and I think there's a similar branding
reputational challenge professionally
it's harder for me to say that I think
about the legal profession because I
know so many incredible business
oriented lawyers that have really helped
transform Industries especially coming
from the gig economy you know lawyers
that are comfortable with risk are the
ones that have made it possible for an
industry that was really on the verge of
an existential threat to now be blessed
by the California well they broke the
law like let's be super clear like in
that industry broke the law you had team
of lawyers pushing the boundaries of the
legal construct and thinking of creative
ways to you know make possible what felt
like an impossible thing you know when
was it 15 years ago uh now when we were
in the early days of of economy and look
like I think KY to answer your question
and this is with a lot of love and
respect for many of my best friends and
mentors who are employment attorneys and
I'm not talking about them but I'm
talking about maybe the more broader
just the same way we do of talk about HR
you know with this like love haate
Dynamic I think they've contributed in
part to why HR has this reputation
because I think lawyers have come in and
been like don't you're don't do that
you're gonna get sued if you do that
you're gonna get sued and all of a
sudden this industry this practice of HR
which I really hate the word HR Human
Resources someone said to me how about
resourceful humans that seems at least a
little bit more but you know they they
put the fear of God into a group of
people who for the most part didn't know
what they wanted to be when they grew up
and sort of fell into doing this work
and are also responsible for risk
management as well as now trying to be
more strategic and the the training the
shms of the world they're really
oriented around compliance and so if
your if all if your best friend is an
employment attorney is like oh here's
here's going to be the way that this is
going to go wrong I mean Pips for God's
sake the reason why Pips exist lawyers
you we have lawyers to think or not
think for that but if we really down the
essence of the advice and we really
think about let's take Pips as a great
example really it's you know is has
there been sufficient
notice of the thing that needs to change
and a fair opportunity to make that
change and can you like kind proved that
that's happened that they've been put on
notice that there's a problem and that
they've been given a fair opportunity to
address it and if you can do that then
like that that sort of absolves the need
of having a pip and you know most of the
time we'll address the issues that are
going on I mean many people asked me
when I left instacart whether I was
going to go back to practicing law and I
was so surprised by the question because
I thought you know why would I do that
you know 90% of the problems that came
my way as an employment attorney outside
of you know wage and hour compliance and
that sort of thing were failures of
culture or failures of
communication so if you really want to
also mitigate your risk you should get
really good at strengthening your
culture and being effective at
communicating that even when it's not
popular so I think earlier you had a
guest talk about you know we're not here
to be like Chief happiness officers like
that's not our job but it is our job to
help make things clear when they're not
and to help you know educate our
employees around the decisions that are
being made I told my last CEO I'm like
I'd bet my left leg that that all most
issues can be distilled down to people
Andor communication it's so it's so true
and I really feel strongly about that
and look you know kind of when I made
the shift over from the legal team to
the HR team there were a couple issues
that came up where someone on my team
would come and say like oh well legal
you know they said that we couldn't do
that and I was like huh really and so I
I found myself like pulling that person
into a room and being like hold on a
second are you telling me X Y and Z I'm
like what if we did it this way would
that sort of satisfy you and they were
like it was a it was literally a
 
this poor woman had been toiling over
for a couple of months and and so I do
you know it feels good to sort of know
what is what is sort of what are red
lines and what are what are not and and
you know sometimes these laws are in
place they don't really have like a lot
of teeth attached to them so really
understanding that too is exactly you
know like okay what if what if this I'm
certainly not advocating for breaking
the law but if you put your business hat
on everything is a risk calculus
including rep risk including cultural
risk there are other risk factors
besides you know a govern agency or a
prospective litigious person coming
forward and that is what any great
lawyer would do and I'm I'm anybody who
wants a roster of like amazing ones that
are business-oriented like that I am
happy to introduce you to some of my
good friends and Nolan I'm like now on a
mission to convince you that that your
impression of lawyers is is just bad
luck look I I think Ravi said it really
well Ravi at seoa I believe was
instacart 2 who said there's oneway door
decisions and there's two-way door
decisions and two-way door decisions
basically we should just go and make the
choice make make the decision because we
can always walk it back and one way door
is the one that we got to take time on
so giz this was a blast so great thank
you so much for taking the time we
sincerely appreciate you so fun this was
so fun for me too I'm really honored to
be here so thanks for inviting me and
we'll catch up soon yes I'm looking
forward to that HR Heretics it's a
