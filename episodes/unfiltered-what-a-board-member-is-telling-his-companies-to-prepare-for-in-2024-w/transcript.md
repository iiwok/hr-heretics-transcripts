you can give us insight into the
conversations happening right now
 
conversations happening right now
between investors Founders and exec and
 
between investors Founders and exec and

backdrop um we invest in seed stage
 
backdrop um we invest in seed stage
companies so they're babies it's like
 
companies so they're babies it's like
eight to 10 people Hing a dream you know
 
eight to 10 people Hing a dream you know
some Excel model that goes to Infinity
 
some Excel model that goes to Infinity
that we sort of chuckle at so we tend to
 
that we sort of chuckle at so we tend to
work sort of at the earlier stage and so
 
work sort of at the earlier stage and so
you know most of the companies that we
 
you know most of the companies that we
work with the funds about five to six
 
work with the funds about five to six
years old are still at a very sort of
 
years old are still at a very sort of
existential stage um now I'm also on the
 
existential stage um now I'm also on the
board of companies including pendu at
 
board of companies including pendu at
 
range of companies but um so for people
 
range of companies but um so for people
that are yet at seriesa I think the
 
that are yet at seriesa I think the
interesting thing from a startup
 
interesting thing from a startup
perspective is that the bar has changed
 
perspective is that the bar has changed
um the world sort of lost its head for
 
um the world sort of lost its head for
about a three to five year period where
 
about a three to five year period where
people were raising money to get to 1
 
people were raising money to get to 1
million ARR and then therefore if you
 
million ARR and then therefore if you
had a million AR everything was figured
 
had a million AR everything was figured
out and you could raise a bunch of money
 
out and you could raise a bunch of money
and you were Off to the Races which we
 
and you were Off to the Races which we
now know is a joke um and so the bar for
 
now know is a joke um and so the bar for
series a has raised probably from one
 
series a has raised probably from one
million to probably two to three million
 
million to probably two to three million
and not only two to three million but
 
and not only two to three million but
people are expecting startups to sort of
 
people are expecting startups to sort of
like having a child and they have to be
 
like having a child and they have to be
captain of the football team captain of
 
captain of the football team captain of
the chess club and get A600 of their act
 
the chess club and get A600 of their act
and like house orphans they need to sort
 
and like house orphans they need to sort
of be amazing so they have to show some
 
of be amazing so they have to show some
level of growth actually show retention
 
level of growth actually show retention
which is really important right now
 
which is really important right now
because retention wasn't what it was and
 
because retention wasn't what it was and
efficiency early on whereas before
 
efficiency early on whereas before
people were like as long as you're
 
people were like as long as you're
growing we don't really care about burn
 
growing we don't really care about burn
and what we're telling them is that's
 
and what we're telling them is that's
really hard that takes time so you need
 
really hard that takes time so you need
to buy yourself the time to sort of get
 
to buy yourself the time to sort of get
to those new benchmarks and as part of
 
to those new benchmarks and as part of
that not only buy them themselves the
 
that not only buy them themselves the
temp business perspective
 
temp business perspective
but buy their buy them their own mental
 
but buy their buy them their own mental
space like when I like being a founder
 
space like when I like being a founder
of a startup is like the worst thing you
 
of a startup is like the worst thing you
can do for mental health right like it's
 
can do for mental health right like it's
not it's not a rational decision right
 
not it's not a rational decision right
and so uh and I'll get to this later but
 
and so uh and I'll get to this later but
like it takes time and if you're forcing
 
like it takes time and if you're forcing
any human being to sort of achieve
 
any human being to sort of achieve
greatness in a very short period of time
 
greatness in a very short period of time
when the reality is you're a baby and
 
when the reality is you're a baby and
you don't know
 
you don't know
much it's probably not going to lead to
 
much it's probably not going to lead to
sort of the most creative thinking
 
sort of the most creative thinking
because you're sort of you're always
 
because you're sort of you're always
under the pressure so we tell them that
 
under the pressure so we tell them that
um I think the other thing we tell
 
um I think the other thing we tell
especially for companies that are larger
 
especially for companies that are larger
look we invest at the seed stage uh our
 
look we invest at the seed stage uh our
LPS expect uh returns in 10 years nobody
 
LPS expect uh returns in 10 years nobody
told me this before I became a seed
 
told me this before I became a seed
investor a 10 year return um as you put
 
investor a 10 year return um as you put
your own money into these funds so as a
 
your own money into these funds so as a
remind Founders we don't do this for the
 
remind Founders we don't do this for the
money we do this because we love the
 
money we do this because we love the
grind so if you're at 5 to 10
 
grind so if you're at 5 to 10
million um I don't want you to talk
 
million um I don't want you to talk
about 24 without giving me context about
 
about 24 without giving me context about
 
think about what we're doing in 24
 
think about what we're doing in 24
because even at 5 to 10 to 15 million
 
because even at 5 to 10 to 15 million
you're still a baby you're you know the
 
you're still a baby you're you know the
analogy I like to use is average life
 
analogy I like to use is average life
expectancy is 77 years old you want to
 
expectancy is 77 years old you want to
get to $100 million and maybe your disc
 
get to $100 million and maybe your disc
discover you be a winner at a million
 
discover you be a winner at a million
dollar that's 1/1 100th so you're like a
 
dollar that's 1/1 100th so you're like a
 
you know you're running races so we tell
 
you know you're running races so we tell
them growth it all costs out the window
 
them growth it all costs out the window
uh and then the last thing we tell them
 
uh and then the last thing we tell them
is especially if they're
 
is especially if they're
selling uh software that they're selling
 
selling uh software that they're selling
to software companies do not assume the
 
to software companies do not assume the
retention that you've had is the
 
retention that you've had is the
retention that you will have it's a big
 
retention that you will have it's a big
shock to a lot of software companies
 
shock to a lot of software companies
this year who last year had like 170%
 
this year who last year had like 170%
nrr and now have like 80% gdr which is
 
nrr and now have like 80% gdr which is
pretty existential and pretty painful
 
pretty existential and pretty painful
and so make the assumption that if
 
and so make the assumption that if
you're trying to sell to any buyer they
 
you're trying to sell to any buyer they
all have to get more efficient
 
all have to get more efficient
regardless of the industry they're going
 
regardless of the industry they're going
to scrutinize each and every dollar and
 
to scrutinize each and every dollar and
so I I want companies to think within
 
so I I want companies to think within
their plan where are they today too much
 
their plan where are they today too much
of a vitamin from a customer perspective
 
of a vitamin from a customer perspective
and what do they need to be a painkiller
 
and what do they need to be a painkiller
and then what then therefore are they
 
and then what then therefore are they
doing about that and are their
 
doing about that and are their
Investments towards that it's not just
 
Investments towards that it's not just
you know know put something in
 
you know know put something in
generative Ai and spit up a new slide so
 
generative Ai and spit up a new slide so
that's sort of a that's high level what
 
that's sort of a that's high level what
we're telling companies about 2024 Brett
 
we're telling companies about 2024 Brett
how hard has it been for Founders to
 
how hard has it been for Founders to
make that pivot I mean the last seven
 
make that pivot I mean the last seven
eight years right money kind of grew on
 
eight years right money kind of grew on
trees this is a hard right turn and a
 
trees this is a hard right turn and a
lot of Founders just being in my seat
 
lot of Founders just being in my seat
and Venture for 15 years working with
 
and Venture for 15 years working with
them haven't seen this before has it
 
them haven't seen this before has it
been super hard like have you had to say
 
been super hard like have you had to say
it three times in different ways or are
 
it three times in different ways or are
people kind of getting it I think it the
 
people kind of getting it I think it the
hardest part part is that we wrongly as
 
hardest part part is that we wrongly as
an industry to find a point of success
 
an industry to find a point of success
to a Founder when you were getting your
 
to a Founder when you were getting your
next funding
 
next funding
round as oppos you didn't start this you
 
round as oppos you didn't start this you
know if you're if you're a great founder
 
know if you're if you're a great founder
you start a business we talked to them
 
you start a business we talked to them
because they can't imagine doing
 
because they can't imagine doing
something else they can't go to sleep at
 
something else they can't go to sleep at
night right they have to go do this and
 
night right they have to go do this and
then if it's a business it needs to make
 
then if it's a business it needs to make
money at some time so I have to start
 
money at some time so I have to start
this it has to make money at some time
 
this it has to make money at some time
so what's the path to there and then
 
so what's the path to there and then
there are levels of success and and
 
there are levels of success and and
check marks that gives you validation
 
check marks that gives you validation
that then says I should invest more
 
that then says I should invest more
money um that kind of got thrown out the
 
money um that kind of got thrown out the
window was all about oh I've raised this
 
window was all about oh I've raised this
money and then I need to do this to get
 
money and then I need to do this to get
to the next Revit money and and those
 
to the next Revit money and and those
metrics were primarily driven by growth
 
metrics were primarily driven by growth
right if you were triple triple double
 
right if you were triple triple double
double awesome if you're not triple
 
double awesome if you're not triple
triple double you're a loser that's like
 
triple double you're a loser that's like
Talladega Nights like if you're not
 
Talladega Nights like if you're not
first you're you're last remember and
 
first you're you're last remember and
his dad's like well there's second and
 
his dad's like well there's second and
there's third and fourth so I think
 
there's third and fourth so I think
that's been hard um I would say for
 
that's been hard um I would say for
companies that are struggling it's
 
companies that are struggling it's
easy right like you say there's no more
 
easy right like you say there's no more
money you need to get to cash flow break
 
money you need to get to cash flow break
even it's a pretty straightforward
 
even it's a pretty straightforward
conversation right uh and some Founders
 
conversation right uh and some Founders
are better than other at making those
 
are better than other at making those
decisions um I think the hard part
 
decisions um I think the hard part
within that
 
within that
is this is where you figure out how
 
is this is where you figure out how
resilient and gritty the founder is
 
resilient and gritty the founder is
although what is interesting is is that
 
although what is interesting is is that
when they do that they basically realize
 
when they do that they basically realize
constraint-based decisions which is
 
constraint-based decisions which is
Nolan you're a little cter and younger
 
Nolan you're a little cter and younger
than KD and I are but that's kind of how
 
than KD and I are but that's kind of how
it used kind of how it used to be in
 
it used kind of how it used to be in
business where like you had
 
business where like you had
constraint-based decisions where you had
 
constraint-based decisions where you had
to make or decisions if I have this
 
to make or decisions if I have this
amount of money how would I prioritize
 
amount of money how would I prioritize
where I would spend it and where do I
 
where I would spend it and where do I
think I would get the best return um
 
think I would get the best return um
what they find is once they get into
 
what they find is once they get into
that or based constraint-based decision
 
that or based constraint-based decision
it's a it's a bit
 
it's a it's a bit
liberating um whereas in the world of
 
liberating um whereas in the world of
like I'm going to do this and this and
 
like I'm going to do this and this and
this and this it's like a bad Benny Hill
 
this and this it's like a bad Benny Hill
skit you know Jacky sacks playing in the
 
skit you know Jacky sacks playing in the
background um it's almost stress
 
background um it's almost stress
relieving in a way I will say where it's
 
relieving in a way I will say where it's
harder is where I have companies that
 
harder is where I have companies that
are winning are doing the triple triple
 
are winning are doing the triple triple
double
 
double
double um and what I try to do for those
 
double um and what I try to do for those
type of companies is I'm like okay for
 
type of companies is I'm like okay for
the next year or two you're going to win
 
the next year or two you're going to win
I start to think about 10 years out and
 
I start to think about 10 years out and
think about what is it for them to be an
 
think about what is it for them to be an
iconic company and when you try to
 
iconic company and when you try to
explain look if we go look at public
 
explain look if we go look at public
companies and how they're valued and the
 
companies and how they're valued and the
success of most of the VC uh funded IPOs
 
success of most of the VC uh funded IPOs
and they haven't been great um because
 
and they haven't been great um because
as their growth rate slips they can't
 
as their growth rate slips they can't
deliver profitability and you know it it
 
deliver profitability and you know it it
ain't great and so uh getting them to
 
ain't great and so uh getting them to
think about the economic shape of their
 
think about the economic shape of their
business and addressing it now has been
 
business and addressing it now has been
a bit
 
a bit
harder interesting Brett a lot of our
 
harder interesting Brett a lot of our
listeners actually don't understand the
 
listeners actually don't understand the
economics of how a VC Works can you talk
 
economics of how a VC Works can you talk
to us about how you think about the
 
to us about how you think about the
death rate of startups and what you
 
death rate of startups and what you
expect normal death rates to be versus
 
expect normal death rates to be versus
what that's been in the last couple of
 
what that's been in the last couple of
years yeah um the reason I was asking
 
years yeah um the reason I was asking
was it's easy to do a broad brush with
 
was it's easy to do a broad brush with
all venture capitalists like do all
 
all venture capitalists like do all
venture capitalists want triple triple
 
venture capitalists want triple triple
double or nothing no I mean there's
 
double or nothing no I mean there's
plenty of funds that invest in certain
 
plenty of funds that invest in certain
sectors and certain level of growth etc
 
sectors and certain level of growth etc
etc look the way Venture generally works
 
etc look the way Venture generally works
is you have to understand the investors
 
is you have to understand the investors
which are LPS which are primarily when
 
which are LPS which are primarily when
you get to a second or third fund it's
 
you get to a second or third fund it's
probably institutional investors these
 
probably institutional investors these
are Pension funds um you know uh
 
are Pension funds um you know uh
colleges uh etc etc retirement funds and
 
colleges uh etc etc retirement funds and
they look at Venture Capital as an asset
 
they look at Venture Capital as an asset
class um from a beta perspective as much
 
class um from a beta perspective as much
higher risk but much higher returns and
 
higher risk but much higher returns and
for them it's a diversification play and
 
for them it's a diversification play and
so when they give money to venture
 
so when they give money to venture
capitalists they are hoping over a
 
capitalists they are hoping over a
 
their money so in a venture firm
 
their money so in a venture firm
depending on where you
 
depending on where you
enter the reality is when we look to
 
enter the reality is when we look to
invest at the seed stage we have to
 
invest at the seed stage we have to
believe this company can get to $100

about liability I just think like don't
even listen to these people like they
 
even listen to these people like they
shouldn't be a part of the conversation
 
shouldn't be a part of the conversation
we should tell the lawyers this is what
 
we should tell the lawyers this is what
we're doing help us make that happen but
 
we're doing help us make that happen but
I don't think that they should actually
 
I don't think that they should actually
be part of the design process because
 
be part of the design process because
they're always going to optimize for
 
they're always going to optimize for
safety so don't include them until it's
 
safety so don't include them until it's
really baked then bring them in and say
 
really baked then bring them in and say
great how does this look from your end
 
great how does this look from your end
so that's how I think about the lawyers
 
so that's how I think about the lawyers
the shitty managers only the shitty
 
the shitty managers only the shitty
managers though Kelly is like this is
 
managers though Kelly is like this is
the thing that I I think is the reason
 
the thing that I I think is the reason
we have this process is because we use
 
we have this process is because we use
annual performance reviews as a back
 
annual performance reviews as a back
stop to make sure managers are
 
stop to make sure managers are
delivering feedback and I just feel like
 
delivering feedback and I just feel like
that problem can be solved a thousand
 
that problem can be solved a thousand
other ways that are more productive for
 
other ways that are more productive for
the manager and for the employee
 
the manager and for the employee
yeah on the lawyer side I will push back
 
yeah on the lawyer side I will push back
lawyers can actually be helpful it's
 
lawyers can actually be helpful it's
kind of like HR people there are shitty
 
kind of like HR people there are shitty
HR people that you don't want to include
 
HR people that you don't want to include
in anything and there are HR people that
 
in anything and there are HR people that
actually help you get there faster and
 
actually help you get there faster and
think of shortcuts or ways to bend the
 
think of shortcuts or ways to bend the
rules so it depends on the lawyer man
 
rules so it depends on the lawyer man
like because of course in these early
 
like because of course in these early
stage companies it is a blood bath I
 
stage companies it is a blood bath I
mean there could be a hundred lawyers in
 
mean there could be a hundred lawyers in
a company if you don't do it right that
 
a company if you don't do it right that
still can't clean up the mess so there
 
still can't clean up the mess so there
there is that versus here's what we're
 
there is that versus here's what we're
doing help us get there because that can
 
doing help us get there because that can
be a recipe for disaster so I think it's
 
be a recipe for disaster so I think it's
a balance I think it's a balance I do um
 
a balance I think it's a balance I do um
but let's let's talk about Pips and
 
but let's let's talk about Pips and
reviews I do agree they are crutches
 
reviews I do agree they are crutches
enforcing functions back stops whatever
 
enforcing functions back stops whatever
you want to call it to elicit behavior
 
you want to call it to elicit behavior
that we want which is feedback and
 
that we want which is feedback and
direct feedback on a regular basis okay
 
direct feedback on a regular basis okay
that is a skill that that a lot of
 
that is a skill that that a lot of
people frankly don't have at all so I do
 
people frankly don't have at all so I do
understand that you need some kind of
 
understand that you need some kind of
training wheels depending on the
 
training wheels depending on the
situation because that's how we work
 
situation because that's how we work
right you can't just get rid of them
 
right you can't just get rid of them
because they're stupid and shitty and
 
because they're stupid and shitty and
expect it to happen that's that's the
 
expect it to happen that's that's the
chasm that you have to like figure out
 
chasm that you have to like figure out
how to how to cross and maybe that's
 
how to how to cross and maybe that's
like you said iterative steps maybe it's
 
like you said iterative steps maybe it's
phases it's not all or nothing or answer
 
phases it's not all or nothing or answer
one or answer two maybe it's answer one
 
one or answer two maybe it's answer one
for six months then we're going to go to
 
for six months then we're going to go to
answer two maybe it's answer one for
 
answer two maybe it's answer one for
this cohort of people then we're gonna
 
this cohort of people then we're gonna
go graduate them like we haven't really
 
go graduate them like we haven't really
experimented with with different
 
experimented with with different
different structures in companies
 
different structures in companies
depending on the segment of people it's
 
depending on the segment of people it's
all or nothing I actually H I've tried
 
all or nothing I actually H I've tried
it a few times I also tested uh 155 back
 
it a few times I also tested uh 155 back
in the day which is basically just like
 
in the day which is basically just like
a continuous feedback tool I found it
 
a continuous feedback tool I found it
amazing but what I learned is is when we
 
amazing but what I learned is is when we
tested it with the engineering team they
 
tested it with the engineering team they
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated it and they felt like it
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated it and they felt like it
was a bigger tax on them and the reason
 
was a bigger tax on them and the reason
why is because they were still think
 
why is because they were still think
thinking well I still have to do this
 
thinking well I still have to do this
annual review at the end of the year and
 
annual review at the end of the year and
so I I do think if you're going to do
 
so I I do think if you're going to do
continuous feedback you have to go all
 
continuous feedback you have to go all
in on that path or if you're just going
 
in on that path or if you're just going
to do like the once a year thing like
 
to do like the once a year thing like
the tradeoffs are nobody's going to get
 
the tradeoffs are nobody's going to get
feedback until it's probably too late
 
feedback until it's probably too late
and so either way there is a tax
 
and so either way there is a tax
Associated but I view that tax is
 
Associated but I view that tax is
healthy to ensure that employees are
 
healthy to ensure that employees are
getting feedback now the the biggest
 
getting feedback now the the biggest
point I want to make I think that
 
point I want to make I think that
there's so many managers that are
 
there's so many managers that are
managing people and they shouldn't be
 
managing people and they shouldn't be
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] near management and so it it
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] near management and so it it
doesn't matter the amount of training
 
doesn't matter the amount of training
you can give these people like you can
 
you can give these people like you can
syn tens of thousands of dollars into
 
syn tens of thousands of dollars into
somebody and the reality is they're not
 
somebody and the reality is they're not
cut out to be a manager and correct we
 
cut out to be a manager and correct we
just want to force these people to be
 
just want to force these people to be
managers or we create these career paths
 
managers or we create these career paths
that basically the only way you can
 
that basically the only way you can
asend is to be a manager and the reality
 
asend is to be a manager and the reality
is is most people aren't cut out for
 
is is most people aren't cut out for
management I always say everybody wants
 
management I always say everybody wants
to be a manager until you are one and
 
to be a manager until you are one and
it's like then it sucks yes and so I I
 
it's like then it sucks yes and so I I
honestly think going back to our
 
honestly think going back to our
conversation with Tomas I think that the
 
conversation with Tomas I think that the
future is going to look a lot more like
 
future is going to look a lot more like
very large spans of control to where
 
very large spans of control to where
today you typically have call it like
 
today you typically have call it like
somewhere between four and seven direct
 
somewhere between four and seven direct
reports I think the future is going to
 
reports I think the future is going to
look a lot more like you have like 15 to
 
look a lot more like you have like 15 to
 
more ic's who are actually doing work
 
more ic's who are actually doing work
and not focused on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of
 
and not focused on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of
managing people well yes so small spans
 
managing people well yes so small spans
of control very structured management a
 
of control very structured management a
lot of rules right that's almost like
 
lot of rules right that's almost like
school that's like the teacher and the
 
school that's like the teacher and the
child whatever it is so if if you have
 
child whatever it is so if if you have
great hires at the IC level that are
 
great hires at the IC level that are
adults I don't care if they're entry
 
adults I don't care if they're entry
level or senior they're adults they're
 
level or senior they're adults they're
responsible they're Achievers they're
 
responsible they're Achievers they're
taking learning upon themselves they're
 
taking learning upon themselves they're
not blaming their manager HR for career
 
not blaming their manager HR for career
development like they're responsible
 
development like they're responsible
adults that are doing great work they
 
adults that are doing great work they
ask questions they raise their hand they
 
ask questions they raise their hand they
say no or I disagree like all of those
 
say no or I disagree like all of those
things then you have an adult as a
 
things then you have an adult as a
manager who is talking like we talk
 
manager who is talking like we talk
right every day I didn't like this why
 
right every day I didn't like this why
did you do this right direct which is
 
did you do this right direct which is
hard for people to do but if you have
 
hard for people to do but if you have
that mixture you're golden like and
 
that mixture you're golden like and
imagine that with 10 people and you're
 
imagine that with 10 people and you're
one of those managers you don't need a
 
one of those managers you don't need a
bunch of Pips and back stops and legal
 
bunch of Pips and back stops and legal
phrases it's just but that that might be
 
phrases it's just but that that might be
as you call me a utopian State like that
 
as you call me a utopian State like that
doesn't
 
doesn't
exist but that is that is the goal right
 
exist but that is that is the goal right
that is the goal at least for me in
 
that is the goal at least for me in
cultures I try to build teams I try to
 
cultures I try to build teams I try to
build absolutely teams I try to work
 
build absolutely teams I try to work
with and it just kind of makes all that
 
with and it just kind of makes all that
easier if you don't have that
 
easier if you don't have that
mistrust
 
mistrust
anxiety like lack of direct feedback it
 
anxiety like lack of direct feedback it
the worst it's the worst working
 
the worst it's the worst working
environment it's the worst it elicits
 
environment it's the worst it elicits
where you got to throw that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
 
where you got to throw that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
down do a pip and it's got to be
 
down do a pip and it's got to be
structured believe me I wasn't into it a
 
structured believe me I wasn't into it a
long time ago my my job like my first
 
long time ago my my job like my first
like hrbp job entry level kind of thing
 
like hrbp job entry level kind of thing
I literally word Smith Pips like half
 
I literally word Smith Pips like half
day you were ahead you were ahead of C I
 
day you were ahead you were ahead of C I
was head of Pips and frankly I was
 
was head of Pips and frankly I was
pretty good at it but it's the phrasing
 
pretty good at it but it's the phrasing
and the words and when you're doing that
 
and the words and when you're doing that
stuff that is a lagging indicator that
 
stuff that is a lagging indicator that
something went wrong Upstream so let's
 
something went wrong Upstream so let's
solve for those Upstream things and if
 
solve for those Upstream things and if
you do that you can use less structure
 
you do that you can use less structure
Downstream tot I couldn't agree more the
 
Downstream tot I couldn't agree more the
the one thing I one of the things I
 
the one thing I one of the things I
learned at door Dash so we had we did
 
learned at door Dash so we had we did
this the thing that everyone does which
 
this the thing that everyone does which
is you take your best ic's and then you
 
is you take your best ic's and then you
promote them to managers and then six
 
promote them to managers and then six
months later these people are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
months later these people are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
miserable and you're not getting as much
 
miserable and you're not getting as much
output out of your team and you're just
 
output out of your team and you're just
like what happened here yeah so we took
 
like what happened here yeah so we took
a step back and what we did was we
 
a step back and what we did was we
created uh dual paths on the career path
 
created uh dual paths on the career path
track so like I were paid as much as
 
track so like I were paid as much as
manager so there wasn't salary U
 
manager so there wasn't salary U
discrepancies between the the the two
 
discrepancies between the the the two
different tracks and the other thing we
 
different tracks and the other thing we
did is we created kind of this like
 
did is we created kind of this like
intermediate step between the two tracks
 
intermediate step between the two tracks
and we called it a lead and the idea was
 
and we called it a lead and the idea was
look everybody is curious about
 
look everybody is curious about
management like that is true like if
 
management like that is true like if
you've been in ic you don't know like I
 
you've been in ic you don't know like I
maybe I will be a good manager maybe I
 
maybe I will be a good manager maybe I
won't be and how can you create the step
 
won't be and how can you create the step
to where it's not as scary to to chest
 
to where it's not as scary to to chest
it out and so what we did is we would
 
it out and so what we did is we would
basically put people that were ices who
 
basically put people that were ices who
wanted to be managers that were high
 
wanted to be managers that were high
performing that we thought had the
 
performing that we thought had the
ingredients to be a good manager into a
 
ingredients to be a good manager into a
lead role and the discussion was we'll
 
lead role and the discussion was we'll
let you test this for three to six
 
let you test this for three to six
months and we're going to give you a ton
 
months and we're going to give you a ton
of feedback along the way and our
 
of feedback along the way and our
expectation is is that you're giving us
 
expectation is is that you're giving us
a ton of feedback on does this give you
 
a ton of feedback on does this give you
energy or not and if you don't like it
 
energy or not and if you don't like it
or we feel that you're unfit to do it
 
or we feel that you're unfit to do it
will just move you back to being an IC
 
will just move you back to being an IC
and it's not like this like scary thing
 
and it's not like this like scary thing
it's just like hey let's go experiment
 
it's just like hey let's go experiment
and test you don't you have one foot in
 
and test you don't you have one foot in
the pool you can always get out you're
 
the pool you can always get out you're
not in the deep end like dying and then
 
not in the deep end like dying and then
you have to
 
you have to
leave so first of all if you don't have
 
leave so first of all if you don't have
dual tracks and a lead type role you you
 
dual tracks and a lead type role you you
got to have that I've known I've known
 
got to have that I've known I've known
nothing about that for like 20 years
 
nothing about that for like 20 years
like 100% And if you're not
 
like 100% And if you're not
incentivizing IC equally that's a
 
incentivizing IC equally that's a
problem because of that Force function
 
problem because of that Force function
into management y now the thing I will
 
into management y now the thing I will
say that that is the
 
say that that is the
real difficulty and I I emphasize
 
real difficulty and I I emphasize
especially with early stage companies
 
especially with early stage companies
that are just running and burning at
 
that are just running and burning at
both ends everything you just said is
 
both ends everything you just said is
Utopia and it takes the biggest thing
 
Utopia and it takes the biggest thing
that people don't have in these
 
that people don't have in these
companies is
 
companies is
time like it has to has to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be a

tops down this is important otherwise it
 
tops down this is important otherwise it
just won't happen and it never gets
 
just won't happen and it never gets
rewarded never like dude make it get a
 
rewarded never like dude make it get a
part of your incentive programs make it
 
part of your incentive programs make it
like a thing because I don't think good
 
like a thing because I don't think good
managers get rewarded enough and I don't
 
managers get rewarded enough and I don't
think bad man get thrown out enough I so
 
think bad man get thrown out enough I so
well said Kelly and and just to like
 
well said Kelly and and just to like
double down on that point you're exactly
 
double down on that point you're exactly
right that like CEOs end up optimizing
 
right that like CEOs end up optimizing
for like right now we need to solve a
 
for like right now we need to solve a
problem yeah and they're completely
 
problem yeah and they're completely
missing the forest from the trees which
 
missing the forest from the trees which
is like well if you invest in these
 
is like well if you invest in these
people not only will they be able to
 
people not only will they be able to
solve that problem then they're going to
 
solve that problem then they're going to
be able to solve the future problems I
 
be able to solve the future problems I
think a lot of CEOs believe that you

you're wrong and you don't get it
 
you're wrong and you don't get it
there's so much pressure and there's so
 
there's so much pressure and there's so
much that I've felt myself in this role
 
much that I've felt myself in this role
for 14 years with founder CEOs multiple
 
for 14 years with founder CEOs multiple
yeah and so you have to empathize with
