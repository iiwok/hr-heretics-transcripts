# Unfiltered: What a Board Member is Telling His Companies to Prepare For in 2024 w Brett Queener

## Transcript

 
I don't want scalers scalers basically
take somebody else's Playbook and scale
it less than 10 million we're just
making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up over here we don't have
repeatability there's no recipe so what
I tell Founders to do is hire mechanics
people that are going to come in and
help figure this stuff out and are
comfortable with failure because like
how do you figure stuff out in life you
only really learn when stuff doesn't go
wrong right like oh I burnt my hand on
the thing I shouldn't do that anymore
and then you okay we did that that
didn't work oh we did that Salesforce
you think there was blogs we were
reading no we'd go to a room we'd be
like all right here's a decision we have
two paths okay what do we think okay
let's try this like 60 days later it's
like how did that work that was terrible
all right let's don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that
again you know write that
[Applause]

down hey hey everybody welcome back to
the HR Heretics podcast where we get
into the real talk of company
construction these are the conversations
that happened between Founders Chief
people officers and board members behind
closed doors we're Heretics in this
industry because there's a culture of
Silence around important business topics
especially with people but on the show
we tell the truth and expect the same
from our guests today we're really
excited to talk with Brett Queener who
comes to us from bonfire Ventures where
he's a MD helping Founders and CEOs with
zero to1 growth grow Brett has an
awesome background as a GM and coo
operator from Salesforce to Smart
recruiters an extensive experienced
board member and actually is a board
member here at pendo who I work really
closely with yeah Brett's awesome he's
one of the few VCS who's actually
operated before which makes him have
some very hot takes about what it's
actually like to build a company versus
like this narrative that VC's have
Sitting from the Ivory Tower so our
audience is going to love that
conversation they're also going to love
the conversation around the death rate
in startups and what Brett's seeing
right now in the post Zer world and what
he expects moving forward into 2024 for
sure he is probably one of the most
entertaining board members I've worked
with in my 14 years in Venture and I say
that in a good way I think because of
that operator experience Nolan he is
like one of the most challenging hit you
on the chin hit you over the head with a
 
it's amazing like the skill set he has
doing that I I actually know a Founder
that Brett is on his board and when I
was talking to that founder cough cough
Danny Danny said oh Brett's super
unfiltered I can't wait to hear what he
says and Brett just kind of has that
like he's been so successful in his
career he could say whatever he wants
and he does yeah and that's why our
audience is going to love the show I
love it and he was at first big company
it's not like he's worked with chro for
 
one of the best that has his point of
view on how to work with chro and the
role itself that's why it's been so fun
to work with him and yes on the
entertaining Factor he him at board
dinners is a whole another level and
like like I got to sit next to Brett I
think like Brett style is very much
coming back into style and today's world
in which like it is a capital
constrained environment interest rates
are higher Brett's a big believer in
working hard in running lean and having
excellent people on the team that are
doers that get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done and he talks a
lot about his talent Philosophy for sure
he is a perfect blend of a hard ass that
actually cares about people so well said
stay tuned after the interview for this
week's segment where Nolan and I discuss
block formerly known to square killing
performance reviews all right everybody
you're going to love this episode here's
Brett Brett so excited to have you thank
you for joining us we're stoked to have
this conversation with you in a very
open way your background's amazing
started off off at seil into Salesforce
for 10 years and an oodle a numers of
board seats advisor investing and now on
bonfire and might I add a board member
of pendo where I'm at now so thank you
for joining us I'm psych to be here
maybe maybe a vocal member at the the
pendo board meeting is my what you call
it might I add one of the best
storytellers I've I've ever met in my
career so my God mention that as well
it's a lot of
pressure all right and where are we
starting my friend Brett I'm curious if
you can give us insight into the
conversations happening right now
between investors Founders and exec and
specifically around 24 what are you
thinking is going to happen going into
 
backdrop um we invest in seed stage
companies so they're babies it's like
eight to 10 people Hing a dream you know
some Excel model that goes to Infinity
that we sort of chuckle at so we tend to
work sort of at the earlier stage and so
you know most of the companies that we
work with the funds about five to six
years old are still at a very sort of
existential stage um now I'm also on the
board of companies including pendu at
 
range of companies but um so for people
that are yet at seriesa I think the
interesting thing from a startup
perspective is that the bar has changed
um the world sort of lost its head for
about a three to five year period where
people were raising money to get to 1
million ARR and then therefore if you
had a million AR everything was figured
out and you could raise a bunch of money
and you were Off to the Races which we
now know is a joke um and so the bar for
series a has raised probably from one
million to probably two to three million
and not only two to three million but
people are expecting startups to sort of
like having a child and they have to be
captain of the football team captain of
the chess club and get A600 of their act
and like house orphans they need to sort
of be amazing so they have to show some
level of growth actually show retention
which is really important right now
because retention wasn't what it was and
efficiency early on whereas before
people were like as long as you're
growing we don't really care about burn
and what we're telling them is that's
really hard that takes time so you need
to buy yourself the time to sort of get
to those new benchmarks and as part of
that not only buy them themselves the
temp business perspective
but buy their buy them their own mental
space like when I like being a founder
of a startup is like the worst thing you
can do for mental health right like it's
not it's not a rational decision right
and so uh and I'll get to this later but
like it takes time and if you're forcing
any human being to sort of achieve
greatness in a very short period of time
when the reality is you're a baby and
you don't know
much it's probably not going to lead to
sort of the most creative thinking
because you're sort of you're always
under the pressure so we tell them that
um I think the other thing we tell
especially for companies that are larger
look we invest at the seed stage uh our
LPS expect uh returns in 10 years nobody
told me this before I became a seed
investor a 10 year return um as you put
your own money into these funds so as a
remind Founders we don't do this for the
money we do this because we love the
grind so if you're at 5 to 10
million um I don't want you to talk
about 24 without giving me context about
 
think about what we're doing in 24
because even at 5 to 10 to 15 million
you're still a baby you're you know the
analogy I like to use is average life
expectancy is 77 years old you want to
get to $100 million and maybe your disc
discover you be a winner at a million
dollar that's 1/1 100th so you're like a
 
you know you're running races so we tell
them growth it all costs out the window
uh and then the last thing we tell them
is especially if they're
selling uh software that they're selling
to software companies do not assume the
retention that you've had is the
retention that you will have it's a big
shock to a lot of software companies
this year who last year had like 170%
nrr and now have like 80% gdr which is
pretty existential and pretty painful
and so make the assumption that if
you're trying to sell to any buyer they
all have to get more efficient
regardless of the industry they're going
to scrutinize each and every dollar and
so I I want companies to think within
their plan where are they today too much
of a vitamin from a customer perspective
and what do they need to be a painkiller
and then what then therefore are they
doing about that and are their
Investments towards that it's not just
you know know put something in
generative Ai and spit up a new slide so
that's sort of a that's high level what
we're telling companies about 2024 Brett
how hard has it been for Founders to
make that pivot I mean the last seven
eight years right money kind of grew on
trees this is a hard right turn and a
lot of Founders just being in my seat
and Venture for 15 years working with
them haven't seen this before has it
been super hard like have you had to say
it three times in different ways or are
people kind of getting it I think it the
hardest part part is that we wrongly as
an industry to find a point of success
to a Founder when you were getting your
next funding
round as oppos you didn't start this you
know if you're if you're a great founder
you start a business we talked to them
because they can't imagine doing
something else they can't go to sleep at
night right they have to go do this and
then if it's a business it needs to make
money at some time so I have to start
this it has to make money at some time
so what's the path to there and then
there are levels of success and and
check marks that gives you validation
that then says I should invest more
money um that kind of got thrown out the
window was all about oh I've raised this
money and then I need to do this to get
to the next Revit money and and those
metrics were primarily driven by growth
right if you were triple triple double
double awesome if you're not triple
triple double you're a loser that's like
Talladega Nights like if you're not
first you're you're last remember and
his dad's like well there's second and
there's third and fourth so I think
that's been hard um I would say for
companies that are struggling it's
easy right like you say there's no more
money you need to get to cash flow break
even it's a pretty straightforward
conversation right uh and some Founders
are better than other at making those
decisions um I think the hard part
within that
is this is where you figure out how
resilient and gritty the founder is
although what is interesting is is that
when they do that they basically realize
constraint-based decisions which is
Nolan you're a little cter and younger
than KD and I are but that's kind of how
it used kind of how it used to be in
business where like you had
constraint-based decisions where you had
to make or decisions if I have this
amount of money how would I prioritize
where I would spend it and where do I
think I would get the best return um
what they find is once they get into
that or based constraint-based decision
it's a it's a bit
liberating um whereas in the world of
like I'm going to do this and this and
this and this it's like a bad Benny Hill
skit you know Jacky sacks playing in the
background um it's almost stress
relieving in a way I will say where it's
harder is where I have companies that
are winning are doing the triple triple
double
double um and what I try to do for those
type of companies is I'm like okay for
the next year or two you're going to win
I start to think about 10 years out and
think about what is it for them to be an
iconic company and when you try to
explain look if we go look at public
companies and how they're valued and the
success of most of the VC uh funded IPOs
and they haven't been great um because
as their growth rate slips they can't
deliver profitability and you know it it
ain't great and so uh getting them to
think about the economic shape of their
business and addressing it now has been
a bit
harder interesting Brett a lot of our
listeners actually don't understand the
economics of how a VC Works can you talk
to us about how you think about the
death rate of startups and what you
expect normal death rates to be versus
what that's been in the last couple of
years yeah um the reason I was asking
was it's easy to do a broad brush with
all venture capitalists like do all
venture capitalists want triple triple
double or nothing no I mean there's
plenty of funds that invest in certain
sectors and certain level of growth etc
etc look the way Venture generally works
is you have to understand the investors
which are LPS which are primarily when
you get to a second or third fund it's
probably institutional investors these
are Pension funds um you know uh
colleges uh etc etc retirement funds and
they look at Venture Capital as an asset
class um from a beta perspective as much
higher risk but much higher returns and
for them it's a diversification play and
so when they give money to venture
capitalists they are hoping over a
 
their money so in a venture firm
depending on where you
enter the reality is when we look to
invest at the seed stage we have to
believe this company can get to $100
million in
revenue
and will'll invest in 25 to 30 companies
in a fund of course very few of them
will get to 100 million in Revenue but
we have to have that belief and sort of
along the way maybe a couple will and
they'll return the vast majority of the
fund so it's very much about the power
laws of the fund and so what that
creates is an interesting dynamic in
Venture and Founders and this is
something to work through which is in
theory you want to push a Founder as
much as possible to pressure test them
to see if they can be that
and that's where you should spend your
time and then your incremental money um
and then if a company if it fails that's
perfectly fine because what you don't
want to do is spend time with the people
that are going to fail now here's the
grand irony Adventure as a former
operator the people that are amazing
don't need your help where you make all
your you make all your money on the
people that don't need your help you
make all your reputation with the
founders that really need help that
maybe only get a 1x exit maybe they get
some money back maybe they find a home
somewhere or a one and a half or 2x exit
um now from a failure rate perspective I
think there's been this artificial thing
uh in the last couple years that oh you
raised money and then the a is
guaranteed Etc um the general math is I
don't know like 5% of companies raise a
seed of the 5% of companies that raise a
seed maybe like 15% raise an egg and
then a 50% R in a like 15% raise a b and
so it's it's very little now one thing
at bonfire we pride ourselves is that we
have like a 70% graduation rate from C
to a now I could ask myself is that a
good thing that may mean we're not
taking enough risk maybe there's too
much confirmation bias but the reality
is if you start a startup or you join an
early St
startup you need to real realize that
unless you're ready to put in sort of
superhuman effort or you're able to sort
of trip the light fantastic the
company's going to
fail it's going to fail and in the short
term and for it this is the conversation
KD and I have had about employees and
what's happened over the last seven
years and you know how do we get people
to realize there many jobs in the world
but startups aren't for them but if you
want to be an iconic company and go
public you have to go hard and you have
to decide if that's for you we'll be
right back in a moment after a word from

interviews head over to metav vi.
a1000 to get started that's metav view.
a1000 I I I have a question I mean
you're a opinionated fellow which is why
I love working with you when founders
tell you hey we're eight people bonfire
I'm going to be the CEO of this place
when we're 2,000 people I'm going to
take it from C to a to e to f one day
maybe there'll be an N through public
and I'm going to stay what do you tell
them when they say that is that possible
if so how well it's not a conversation
we have we're both we're trying to court
them right we're not having a
conversation about when we're going if
we're going to get rid of
them look I think the first thing
is it's always easier if the founder can
scale because there's nothing that
replaces the soul of a founder
it that just doesn't right um but the
reality is look one of the pictures we
have and we say why bonfire is at seed
we tell them CED day is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard
it's so hard right like you have two
Journeys you have to go on one you got
to go from like oh I got a couple
customers and some code Etc to like a
somewhat of a scalable business where
you can explain to a seriesa investor
I've got something like you have to
prove that my first motion works this
product to this buyer Etc
and and then the second one is you as an
individual have to grow as a leader and
the company can only grow as fast as the
CEO it that's it um and it's hard now it
also leads to interesting things the
problem is a lot of Founders think oh
I've got to scale super early and they
remve themselves early from deals and
the rest of it and then it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show
like no no no no no
we like the fact that you are
micromanaging in in everything you've
seen this KD but um when you have a
competent CEO who early on they're in
the decisions we love that about them
they Commander the
business but if they're the bottleneck
because they haven't hired a team that
they trust and they haven't figured out
the dynamic of the relationship between
them are they an alpha are they a beta
and the leader and figured out a way to
manage that um that's a problem
second is as they grow and this is
harder for um our in tjs you know not
the entjs Myers Briggs Myers Briggs
sorry I've done the I've done them for
years hoping they'll say something
different they're always like uh you're
driver driver [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm like
come on uh come on somebody do Embrace
Bret absolutely I did the new Millennial
one which is great tell strength finders
where it tells you your strengths and
then gives you only the weaknesses
within the context of your strengths
you'll pay attention maybe yes um second
they have to be amazing internal
communicators as you get larger and
larger like the number one job is to be
a chief repeater officer right you have
got to be constantly laying out the
vision the plan why we're doing stuff
and doing that uh and people struggle
with that um they struggle with being
narrators and communicating that they
struggle with consistency and they
struggle with the right level of
overconfidence but also vulnerable
cander
um and then the third one which is
really
hard because we spend so much time
saying in the early days your first 10
leaders are really important because
they're going to be the carriers of the
culture torches down the road that's
just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think what they all said
was realizing the team that got me to
one phase is likely not the one at the
next and that's okay you didn't let them
down they didn't let you down it's okay
now you can't have your entire
leadership team you know be mercenaries
high from outside but I think those are
the three things that we constantly work
with Founders on um and then I know you
do this KD what I do a lot with Founders
is I look I get real Founders and I love
them but try to get them to be cognizant
of where they're strong and where
they're weak and uh make sure that as
they hire and they build out their team
they are hiring people who are strong
where they're weak one um it builds a
better
organization two it brings to some
extent except for the most Psychopathic
CEOs calmer leadership because they
don't they don't it's okay that they
don't know that because they have
somebody who's great at that and so they
can lean into where they're strong and
into their Vibe those are the areas that
I find Brett can you I'm I'm really
curious in this conversation Around
Talent planning especially at the
executive level can you lift the veil
for our audience on where you involve
yourself as it relates to a founder and
talent planning and when do you talk
about the executive team
and how do closed door sessions work as
it relates to like those types of
questions well early on there's like
eight people right so I'm trying to
figure out what our priorities for the
next couple years are and within those
priorities we're talking about just FTE
you know like you got two developers you
know turns out you got one rep turns out
if you don't have a great product and
nobody's selling it I'm not an expert
you don't need read a lot of blogs but I
can promise you when you get get to the
operating plan is not going to be that
interesting you know so early on it's
what are the priorities that and in the
early days you can't afford to hire a
great leadership team you can't even
afford to hire a full leadership team
and so early on it's trying to figure
out which hat makes sense for the
founder to continue to wear and then
what do we need to hire and then very
much I'm involved in what type of hire
what skill set we're looking for and
then with the founder the hardest the
weirdest thing like when I would
interview with startups there's this
weird dance where you go to a startup
and what I want to know is as a
candidate is like all right what's
screwed up here what must be true what
do they need and then what the founder
wants to know with this candidate it's
really hard now right because
everybody everybody jumps every two
years like what the hell like look this
person went to four companies that never
did anything and they never did
something okay I'm
you know my guidance to founder is do
not hire somebody where their first win
is going to be at your company that's
not for startup but there's this weird
dance if found wants to know where this
person is good does that match what I
need and where they're weak is that okay
and no one has that vulnerable
conversation so I'm very specific around
a very transparent vulnerable on both
sides hiring process um so that's early
days as it gets to
leadership
um you know I have a good fortune having
been to working at seil and Salesforce
Etc knowing what a terrific leader is um
I think the hardest transition is in the
early days people want to find somebody
that
scales but up to like 10 million in
Revenue I don't want scalers scalers
basically take somebody else's Playbook
and scale it less than 10 million we're
just making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up over here we don't
have repeatability there's no recipe so
what I tell Founders to do is hire
mechanics people that are going to come
in and help figure this stuff out and
are comfortable with
failure right because like how do you
figure stuff out in life you only really
learn when stuff doesn't go wrong right
like oh I burnt my hand on the thing I
shouldn't do that anymore and then you
okay we did that that didn't work oh we
did that Salesforce you think there was
blogs we were reading no we go to a room
we'd be like all right here's a decision
we have two paths okay what do we think
okay let's try this how we know if it
would measure it work let's do it like
days later is like how did that work
that was terrible all right let's don't
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that again you know write
that down and then we'd be like oh that
worked let's do more of it that was the
genius Playbook of SAS at Salesforce so
I I tell them to hide from mechanics and
then as we get later it was sort
interesting Nolan you're friends with
Danny he had his first board meeting in
person and I show up and you know get up
to 4:00 in the morning to fly to Chicago
you know it's cuz I live in Santa
Barbara wo was me wo me um and I I see
his engineering leader I'm like hey am
going to see you at dinner tonight and
he's like no I wasn't invited
F so I called Danny I'm like Danny who's
coming to the board dinner tonight oh
the board members and me I'm like what
is the point of that I'm G VC's I mean
there's plenty of opportunities to VC's
drink expensive wine together the point
of the board meeting is we want to
engage with you but we know you but we
want engage with your management team
one to get the next level detail and two
to help guide you to understand how
aligned they are and how competent they
are and if you don't invite them to the
board dinner that's where we loosen them
up and they realize we bleed we're
humans as well right right like you know
you'll get the random board member
that'll like throw out libertarian weird
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's unacceptable or talk about
their house in the south of France okay
fine like okay stop but and then I said
well okay how about the board me meeting
tomorrow I'm going to bring him in one
by one what like it's a firing
line like what are you doing so I said
for now next board dinner I'm not coming
to your board dinner unless your
leadership team is there and he did
adjust for the board meeting where we
had the Open Session close session with
the CEO to talk and then bring the
entire leadership team in because look
we're not here to prosecute the
management team we're here to just
understand what's going on because we're
not in the muck we're level up look to
understand is the team aligned or is
with one person saying doesn't seem
align with the other or and sometimes be
like that's not a that
person we do judge like that person's
not going to get you there right at
every stage there are sad conversations
where you hired somebody who was great
for 18 months and the founder gets on
the phone and is like uh and what I
always said about you KD but like
Founders are like oh I don't really know
about this
person and I'm always like if your gut
just telling you this is not the right
leader they're not the right leader it's
time to Mo right totally we'll be right
back in a moment after award from our
sponsors hey everybody your co-host
Nolan here high performance and great
culture should never be at odds they're
better together with Lattis people

lace.com HR Heretics today that's Lattis
 
la.com you said something that I love
board meetings we judge we're judging
and I love that because you are and you
should and executives are always like
are they judging me in here yes they are
judging you there and we have a lot of
HR Chief people officers HR leaders
Founders investors on the line talk to
talk to us about you know a lot of these
issues and challenges with scale and
even just dayby day has to do with
people um and organization and
communication how do you know the right
things are happening from a board
meeting with that people leader and that
founder right because you're on a lot of
boards you can't go deep in every
company what are what are the signs that
you're seeing in that board meeting or
other that you know that company has the
right people leader or not um it's
interesting uh my perspective
is there are two types of people where I
can figure out pretty quickly if they're
amazing a
founder and a
chro like within one minute I'm like I'm
from first board me with KD and I'm like
I'm like what who is that who is this
who is this alien that's flown in
talking business firming her answers I
was
like because they're rare so um how do I
know it's working
um well I'm a remember I'm more involved
at most companies than at the board
level like there's usually not a
surprise at the board now on pendo for
example an independent you know but I'm
in the slack group I watch this stuff
going on
um how do I
know that we have what a great people
organization great people leader
 
um now I'm going to reflect back on when
I ran organizations
um I think the large was probably 3 4
thousand people uh one the employees we
have are heavily engaged in busting
their ass that's the number one thing uh
two performance manager is Nails hor
performers up top performers
up
um uh no drama around compensation we
are not peanut buttering crap right top
performers get way
overpaid uh underperformers are exited
from the business and middle performers
are encouraged to become top performers
or they're going to become bottom
performers uh the recruiting funnel and
process is great it is very hard to get
hired in my organiz
ation um employee communication is
transparent consistent and the right
level of like and cander right like
that's hard to do uh and I think
ultimately um because in New York I ever
ran you know like at Salesforce or
others uh I had I did have an HR person
working for me at smart recruiters but
like at a large or what was interesting
was the hrvp who reported to our
business units worked for the chro but
they were on my leadership team they
were in my meetings they were all
offsites Etc uh and so for because then
you have to have context um so for me my
managers would think of HR as their job
and not something to Outsource right the
HR business partner is there to help
them but like if we don't hire somebody
they miss their hiring goal I'm not
firing the recruiter I'm firing the
manager if you know if the team sucks
and we haven't managed performance I'm
not firing HR I'm firing the manager um
and so my emplo my manager thinks of HR
is their job and not something to
Outsource and they can't imagine doing
their job without sort of their HR
business partner that's what I'm running
in org um it's a little harder at the
board meeting obviously other than if
there's like a kickass CH row just shows
up like a cowboy sheriff and just says
like like it is I'm like oh I like that
 
person that is so good Brett um I love
the idea of bringing the chro to all of
your your leadership meetings um I also
love the it's the manager's job not the
hrbp or the head of recruiting job like
they're there to enable you and I think
that's a sign for our listeners of like
if you're getting the finger pointed at
you to do the manager's job that's a red
flag for you and something that but noan
but Nolan it's often hr's fault when I
left Salesforce I went to please I went
to sell the HR and recruiting I would go
in and show them this app and I'm like
look instead of you having to do all
this work the manager has a login and
then the manager is responsible for
working their funnel the manager is
responsible for coming up at the job
description the manager is responsible
for um Coming Up with the right uh
interview criteria and it's on the
manager and they track and I promise you
not seven out of 10 times is like I
don't want to give the manager that
level of control I'm like oh my God what
am I doing here
 
so right you know it's not totally like
like if you and H yeah it's the
manager's job uh I think we're going to
get back to that in sort of this new
world of efficiency and you know and
delivery yeah yeah I mean we've asked
others curious your opinion on this the
last couple years Etc do you think HR
leaders Founders companies have gone a
little soft I know with this move to
efficiency Etc there's been more Nails
more pressure around bottom line do you
think we've all gotten a little soft the
past five years you asked if HR has
gotten soft I think it's a little unfair
I think companies have gotten soft um
but I think that's changing back
dramatically look I think it's important
to understand context I'm older the most
podcast presenters I try to stay pretty
and young in my career there is a
seven-year boom and bust in technology
and so by year five it gets a little
froy there's more
money we got more people it gets a
little softer D D D D but then there's
but then the market crashes and the
frauds all go home fraud investors fraud
employees all go home we went 14 years
in a zero interest rate environment so
I'm just trying to give the over
context as to why we may have become a
bit soft um but definitely I think orgs
became a bit soft um and you
know what is interesting though
 
is I think why orgs became soft and I
think this is relevant to HR Executives
and Business Leaders is let's just call
a spade a spade we can talk about work
life balance all we want but if you're
trying to build iconic software
companies that are going to go do the
impossible what are you trying to do
you're trying to hire people who make
terrible work life balance decisions
that's what we're trying to
do but then the question is how do you
how does that happen and they don't
resent you for it there this
conversation we had last night Josh was
I was up till 2:30 in the morning
putting these this slide presentation
you were giving for executive offsite
and you were telling me this imagery
there was a presentation where um I was
running applications and the platform
team wanted to
um
uh B AWS and I was like we sit an orc we
can't do this and I was trying to
convince them to be a metadata platform
so it was an executive offsite where
Obama was running for president for the
first time and so I had memorized all of
his speeches and then translated it to
like instead of blue States and red
States you know app platform um I even
created an attack ad against me
uh with a video and we had buttons and
the rest of it and and it was an insane
level of work and these people did an
insane level of work to 230 but they
loved it because they knew what I was
trying to get across and so what it gets
back to is you know I don't read a lot
of business books but you know what I
would give to every first time manager
or second time manager is Daniel Pink's
Drive which is what makes and I assume
maybe you've read this book but it
starts out with a very interesting story
Sweden used to give the most blood in
the world donate the blood and then they
had a shortage of blood so they started
paying swedes to donate blood and all
the blood donation
stopped why because people did not give
blood for money they gave it for another
intrinsic motivation and so how do I get
people to run through walls well what do
humans need Beyond making some money one
they have a need for Mastery am I
getting better at my craft two humans
have a need for being self-directed so
if I'm getting a better at my craft will
you give me more responsibility and not
micromanage me as enough okay those are
good the third one is linking okay the
job that I'm doing where I'm getting
Mastery and self-directed does it
actually matter at this company like if
I went away tomorrow would it matter and
the fourth which is much harder
especially for software companies
because 98% of them just don't
matter why does this company
matter and I think where we got soft is
we forgot that equation and we forgot
that you need to line all of those up to
get people to work hard um and then of
course work from home and the rest of it
Etc but I would say that need Daniel
pink wrote that book about 15 years ago
is stronger than
today
 
because individuals younger ones
especially respect flexibility actually
older ones when you start to have your
first child I'm joking the other day my
wife was like your employee gets six
months off for paternity leave I think
you had two
days right um and she didn't say it like
Boo is us she's like how the hell these
people get six months off I just had
that conversation last week with someone
and we're four months so you can imagine
well she also said to me like what would
I do with you for six months you were
completely worthless to me when the kids
were she's like that would have been
worthless I would make you go away for
six months but but like we do respect
flexibility uh and I think and I think
individuals are trying to get more
meaning for their from their job and I
think unfortunately you know uh there's
this false set of expectations for kids
by the time they get to college to know
what they want to do in live you know
where I was like I don't know I got a
job and then like I did that job for
five years I became a senior manager and
then I went to business school and then
I was made a leader and I a director and
I was terrible for two years uh and then
by you know by 30 I'd kind of figure it
out so I think yes we've gotten soft but
I think we've gotten lazy in terms of
what it means as a company to motivate
individuals and drive them hard actually
not drive not drive them hard motivate
them for themselves to drive themselves
hard how do we get
people to love working hard and to
appreciate it like I think about Novak
jokovic and Serena Williams they work
their asses off maybe more than anyone
on the planet to be great at their craft
yet when we think about working in
technology if you work that hard it's
almost like you get negative
connotations why do you think that
is where are you getting negative con I
love those people what do you mean
where's the negative connotations coming
from I it's on LinkedIn Brett I mean
there's people want to work 40 hours a
week There's a sound bite that working
above 40 hours a week means that you
don't have work life balance look I
think at the end of the day forget the
hours focus on the
output what are you
accomplishing like I never cared how
many hours somebody worked I cared did
they get it done and was it great you
know it's funny I I get the parents of
kids who grew up with my kids who want
to get into business they will you give
my son advice is coming out of college
and the kid will be like yeah I was
going to take this consulting job but it
required traveling 60 hours of
work and I said Johnny or whatever his
name is I'm the wrong guy to talk to you
will bust your
ass you are 22 or 23 years old you have
no idea what you want to do you need to
go work really hard and that will let
you know are you good at this and do you
like this and Etc like so I'm the wrong
person to ask from that front now I'll
tell you what I used to do as as a
leader and Mark did this he was very
good at
Salesforce
um you're going to bust your ass for 12
weeks a quarter I pulled my leadership
team aside and they'd say pull up your
schedules okay every one of you is going
away for a week when and they like I'm
I'm like no no you are going away for a
week let's plan it uh well I'm going for
three days no you don't go away for
three days takes like that's worthless
you are going away for a week and if you
get on email and you get on we didn't
have slack at the time you're not
getting your bonus or I'm gonna fire you
you're going to take your family away
because it's going to take you two days
to unwind three days to be present and
then two days to be stressed out about
going to work but you need to get out of
here and clear your head and invariably
when they would come back they were
refreshed um and had new ideas it also
was selfish for me because it sounds
really cool but the issue is that if you
were in the grind all the time you can't
pull your head up and so even though I
told them don't send me email and the
rest of it they're clearly thinking
about work um it allows them to pull
away so look I think it's about work
life balance but everybody makes their
own decisions um but I don't there's no
iconic software company where people
aren't busting their ass this just
doesn't exist reminds me of the first
company when we moved to you know
unlimited vacation no policy we had to
ironically put in a damn policy because
no one was taking the
vacation so you know it's funny yeah
it's funny we did it as a moment of
dignity um but people weren't taking
advantage of it yeah it was weird yeah
so it was a policy on top of a no policy
to take it it was well we have
definitely wanted to take it because we
still have to acrew for it BR I have one
I know we're running up against time I
have one quick question I no one wants
to Pivot to advice or lessons really
quick um we talked to to a lot of folks
around the relationship between the chro
and the founder and how that how
important that is is you know for for
company health and scale and all those
things H how do you create
 
that it's hard it is hard because
there's some preconceived notions about
the role of HR especially with
inexperience leaders where the
Assumption of HR is to make sure one I
don't get into
trouble two is to set up sort of these
administrative functions like recruiting
and benefits it takes two to tango so
I'll start on the ch
side uh look the CH needs to be a great
chro and people have asked you what's a
great
chro um like at a board meeting like how
did I know you rocked KD from the board
meeting it's like one you know the
business inside and out you're a
business person first and
foremost um
two you can communicate the challenges
and opportunities of the business as it
relates to our personnel
three uh you can you are very good at
looking at the vital few things we need
to do as opposed to useless
spending um they take you take
accountability for hits and
misses and then the CEO relies on them
innately so let's get back to that right
it's interesting I think a great chro
and a great Chief legal officer should
be the CEO's consigli Aries um on the
chro side
they should know you better than most I
used to have chro was very funny when I
would present at a large meeting and you
invited me on this podcast to be spicy I
don't know if it been spicy enough yes
please but I would go to present and
they had this hand signal in the back
and I'd watch their eyes and it was for
like it be like this like one lane then
it'd be like dotted line and then she
she could see where I was going and she
would hold up like double line do not
cross do not say that so these videos
and be like no and I start riffing like
okay well I can't say that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so
um and
so I
 
think I think if I'm a CEO on their side
uh and so look the CEO can't be an
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can't be a psychopath um has to
be very clear about the business
priorities are um and take very
seriously the evolution of the company
from a Personnel stuff that's how think
about it for sure yeah and I don't know
if you agree Nolan or or Brett but being
an Venture for 15 years I've worked with
usually always multiple Founders at one
company not just one and there is a
level of empathy and appreciation for
sometimes them being psycho I mean
that's who they are that's why they are
brilliant that's why they can build
these things and I think a lot of HR
folks can lead with the thing first well
they're not letting me do this program
they're not it's like their brains are
wired in a very unique unque way and
just to appreciate that and start there
and then work backwards from that I
think is something that's really
important to be in this role and live
with these people it's back to strength
finders if you go to a CEO and and
understand that like part of that Genius
of a Founder is it's Insanity right like
it's cre it's crazy it's chaotic
creation and if you work with Nolan and
you build it and you talk to him and you
say look this is amazing this is amazing
but out of that amazingness it creates
these challenges I'm not asking you to
change that because that's what fires us
up but we kind of need to do this you
know like Frank slutman went on a
podcast and said diversity doesn't
matter and then like a day or two later
his HR person came to him and said hey
Frank you're amazing your book is
amazing but you know maybe the diversity
doesn't matter line was inappropriate
and even Frank came back was like all
right that I was taken out whatever that
might be um but I agree and it's hard
but look if you're in chro if there's
one executive that doesn't is not
empathetic to what is good and what is
bad then you then HR is
not is not for you as a
career all right Brett I want to get to
our rapid fire question segment which we
call Talent rules so we ask every guest
these questions the first is who's the
best hire you've ever seen and and from
your lens as a VC someone that's like
transformed a company that when they
showed up the company changed now now
most of my career right I've worked for
two billionaires that used to work for
Larry
Ellison and in those businesses as
successful as I thought I was or
everybody else it didn't matter that
founder was I founder was on their way
and deep product Market fit yes yes
um in regards to
startups I thought about this question
but I didn't want to name this
individual it tends to
be the first great head of
product because you got a Founder who
thinks they're doing product and we do
this and we do that etc etc but it's the
first gr head of product who thinks
about look at the end of day for this
person this is the jobs that need to be
done and here's how how we're going to
do it better and can paint a multi-year
path towards that and then organize the
company around that um it's really
unifying
um and then it's the first grade head of
sales honestly what I always say to
entrepreneurs you're not a you're not a
real entrepreneur until you fired your
first three head of sales like it takes
you're just not like this idea that like
oh I got rid of my head of s I was like
oh you too you know it's like a it's
like an alcoholic's Anonymous reading
hello I'm an alcoholic you know so I
generally it's those um it's those two
now outside of that
 
it's some crazy person sort of in
operations or product marketing Etc
[Music]
who basically realizes if you are a
software company you have to take a
stance you are for something or you're
against something and then start to
outline these are the we're against this
and these are all the people who support
what we're against and we must take them
out and sort of build if you will
that institutional muscle and fervor
around that um so that's how I think
about it I didn't want to name names
because I've worked with a lot of sort
of individuals and companies love that
and then what's your favorite interview
question that gets you the best signal
on candidates I love that one so what I
always do and I set them up for this
like tell me about a ball boss like that
you loved and you respect uh get his
name what did you you know love and
respect well he's great how long has it
been we work with him I said all right
so I'm gonna call Jill
tomorrow and I'm gonna ask Jill we'll
get through the pleasantries I'm gonna
say Jill I need two one sentence answers
can you give me one
sentence on what they would say one
sentence about what's great about this
employee so I asked the candidate what
would they say
 
but I'm only really setting it up for
this and this after like a five minute
 
dialogue and if I asked them in your
performance
reviews uh Etc what was the one thing
you were always giving them feedback if
your reviews were like they're great but
what was that but what did they have to
get much better at to achieve their
career goals what did they say and
people struggle with that and and so
what I'm really looking for there is
self-awareness around where they're
strong and where they're weak and their
willingness to be
vulnerable to to tell me that you know
the oh if I get the my boss said I work
too
hard my boss went on LinkedIn and wrote
a blog post about me working more than
 
hiring that person my favorite is I
don't delegate
enough
yeah yeah so that's mine what is yours
Katie quickly before you guys kick me to
the curve so I I do ask I say hey you
know I'm a big fan of 360s and you know
getting getting feedback whatnot if I
ask 30 of your friends former peers
bosses direct reports cross functional
stakeholders and I I would have 30
conversations I love the chat what would
they tell me what would they tell me
this is their super power you need them
for this and what would they tell me
you're going to have to work on this and
help them with X and I maybe it's unfair
to say give me one sentence because then
I'm asking them to be concise as well uh
anyways that's that's my favorite
interview question to use uh this was
awesome Brett thank you as always for
the cander and the
entertainment this is so good so good
thank you so much all right thank you
talk to you soon have a good weekend bye
bye
 
bye all right Kelly so Jack dorsy who
was the CEO of Twitter and also the CEO
of block formerly known as Square just
decided to kill performance reviews at
the company and they did a couple of
things and I'll break it down and then I
want to get into it with you so he said
performance reviews actually don't help
us get better he said performance should
be continuously evaluated and feedback
should not be queued up for later I
don't think anybody disagrees with that
but we'll get into it uh he also said
that they're still doing employeer
ratings but they've simplified it down
to three ratings which is basically
exceeds meets and below and then they're
also ending Pips and what he said about
that was they don't actually work
consistently and they often feel way too
late they don't push the manager to give
feedback in a timely manner manag in a
manner uh it's lazy and often surprising
that we can avoid with direct and
consistent feedback so I'd love I have a
lot of takes on this I'd love to get
your take on what block is doing right
now with performance for sure I mean
this is this is
something oh my where this has been a
thing for at least my 24 years in HR
it's been you know up and down and left
and right you have Microsoft right years
ago with big announcements around
reviews no one's really figured this out
and frankly I'm not sure that that there
is one right answer I really don't
totally and then it will change right
things shift and change new generations
come up like I I I don't think that the
right answer is to like search for and
declare I totally agree I don't think
that there's one right answer for sure
but it kind of seems like there's just a
bunch of bad answers today yeah yeah you
know and I remember the days when I was
at at Yahoo and I was young and I was
riding my own like lumbering annual one
year freaking performance review and sap
success factors no less um and it was
brutal I mean that that's definitely the
wrong answer so maybe maybe it's easier
to start with the wrong wrong answers
back into it well in all seriousness I I
think that we've been starting with the
activities right you start with the why
so let's let's create the answer based
on what we want at the company that
we're at and the time that we're in and
yes everyone starts with the form the
Cadence like let's not start with the
activities and I think it will lead to a
better answer that's right for each
company I loved so I go back to our
episode with Steve and if anyone wants a
really hot take on performance reviews
go listen to the episode with Steve
cigan who is the former chro of LinkedIn
and he he told us a story about all of
the executives hating the performance
review process and Steve was like great
like let's throw it out and people what
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like what do you mean throw it
out and it's so weird that we get
attached to these things that we've
invented but once we start doing them in
a regular Cadence throwing them out
feels so radical when it's just if we
just run all these things like an
experiment and look at it and it's not
working here's my take I think the
current annual performance review
process that is copied by 90% of
companies
optimizes for shitty managers and
lawyers that are worried about liability
and so like the lawyers that are worried
about liability I just think like don't
even listen to these people like they
shouldn't be a part of the conversation
we should tell the lawyers this is what
we're doing help us make that happen but
I don't think that they should actually
be part of the design process because
they're always going to optimize for
safety so don't include them until it's
really baked then bring them in and say
great how does this look from your end
so that's how I think about the lawyers
the shitty managers only the shitty
managers though Kelly is like this is
the thing that I I think is the reason
we have this process is because we use
annual performance reviews as a back
stop to make sure managers are
delivering feedback and I just feel like
that problem can be solved a thousand
other ways that are more productive for
the manager and for the employee
yeah on the lawyer side I will push back
lawyers can actually be helpful it's
kind of like HR people there are shitty
HR people that you don't want to include
in anything and there are HR people that
actually help you get there faster and
think of shortcuts or ways to bend the
rules so it depends on the lawyer man
like because of course in these early
stage companies it is a blood bath I
mean there could be a hundred lawyers in
a company if you don't do it right that
still can't clean up the mess so there
there is that versus here's what we're
doing help us get there because that can
be a recipe for disaster so I think it's
a balance I think it's a balance I do um
but let's let's talk about Pips and
reviews I do agree they are crutches
enforcing functions back stops whatever
you want to call it to elicit behavior
that we want which is feedback and
direct feedback on a regular basis okay
that is a skill that that a lot of
people frankly don't have at all so I do
understand that you need some kind of
training wheels depending on the
situation because that's how we work
right you can't just get rid of them
because they're stupid and shitty and
expect it to happen that's that's the
chasm that you have to like figure out
how to how to cross and maybe that's
like you said iterative steps maybe it's
phases it's not all or nothing or answer
one or answer two maybe it's answer one
for six months then we're going to go to
answer two maybe it's answer one for
this cohort of people then we're gonna
go graduate them like we haven't really
experimented with with different
different structures in companies
depending on the segment of people it's
all or nothing I actually H I've tried
it a few times I also tested uh 155 back
in the day which is basically just like
a continuous feedback tool I found it
amazing but what I learned is is when we
tested it with the engineering team they
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated it and they felt like it
was a bigger tax on them and the reason
why is because they were still think
thinking well I still have to do this
annual review at the end of the year and
so I I do think if you're going to do
continuous feedback you have to go all
in on that path or if you're just going
to do like the once a year thing like
the tradeoffs are nobody's going to get
feedback until it's probably too late
and so either way there is a tax
Associated but I view that tax is
healthy to ensure that employees are
getting feedback now the the biggest
point I want to make I think that
there's so many managers that are
managing people and they shouldn't be
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] near management and so it it
doesn't matter the amount of training
you can give these people like you can
syn tens of thousands of dollars into
somebody and the reality is they're not
cut out to be a manager and correct we
just want to force these people to be
managers or we create these career paths
that basically the only way you can
asend is to be a manager and the reality
is is most people aren't cut out for
management I always say everybody wants
to be a manager until you are one and
it's like then it sucks yes and so I I
honestly think going back to our
conversation with Tomas I think that the
future is going to look a lot more like
very large spans of control to where
today you typically have call it like
somewhere between four and seven direct
reports I think the future is going to
look a lot more like you have like 15 to
 
more ic's who are actually doing work
and not focused on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of
managing people well yes so small spans
of control very structured management a
lot of rules right that's almost like
school that's like the teacher and the
child whatever it is so if if you have
great hires at the IC level that are
adults I don't care if they're entry
level or senior they're adults they're
responsible they're Achievers they're
taking learning upon themselves they're
not blaming their manager HR for career
development like they're responsible
adults that are doing great work they
ask questions they raise their hand they
say no or I disagree like all of those
things then you have an adult as a
manager who is talking like we talk
right every day I didn't like this why
did you do this right direct which is
hard for people to do but if you have
that mixture you're golden like and
imagine that with 10 people and you're
one of those managers you don't need a
bunch of Pips and back stops and legal
phrases it's just but that that might be
as you call me a utopian State like that
doesn't
exist but that is that is the goal right
that is the goal at least for me in
cultures I try to build teams I try to
build absolutely teams I try to work
with and it just kind of makes all that
easier if you don't have that
mistrust
anxiety like lack of direct feedback it
the worst it's the worst working
environment it's the worst it elicits
where you got to throw that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
down do a pip and it's got to be
structured believe me I wasn't into it a
long time ago my my job like my first
like hrbp job entry level kind of thing
I literally word Smith Pips like half
day you were ahead you were ahead of C I
was head of Pips and frankly I was
pretty good at it but it's the phrasing
and the words and when you're doing that
stuff that is a lagging indicator that
something went wrong Upstream so let's
solve for those Upstream things and if
you do that you can use less structure
Downstream tot I couldn't agree more the
the one thing I one of the things I
learned at door Dash so we had we did
this the thing that everyone does which
is you take your best ic's and then you
promote them to managers and then six
months later these people are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
miserable and you're not getting as much
output out of your team and you're just
like what happened here yeah so we took
a step back and what we did was we
created uh dual paths on the career path
track so like I were paid as much as
manager so there wasn't salary U
discrepancies between the the the two
different tracks and the other thing we
did is we created kind of this like
intermediate step between the two tracks
and we called it a lead and the idea was
look everybody is curious about
management like that is true like if
you've been in ic you don't know like I
maybe I will be a good manager maybe I
won't be and how can you create the step
to where it's not as scary to to chest
it out and so what we did is we would
basically put people that were ices who
wanted to be managers that were high
performing that we thought had the
ingredients to be a good manager into a
lead role and the discussion was we'll
let you test this for three to six
months and we're going to give you a ton
of feedback along the way and our
expectation is is that you're giving us
a ton of feedback on does this give you
energy or not and if you don't like it
or we feel that you're unfit to do it
will just move you back to being an IC
and it's not like this like scary thing
it's just like hey let's go experiment
and test you don't you have one foot in
the pool you can always get out you're
not in the deep end like dying and then
you have to
leave so first of all if you don't have
dual tracks and a lead type role you you
got to have that I've known I've known
nothing about that for like 20 years
like 100% And if you're not
incentivizing IC equally that's a
problem because of that Force function
into management y now the thing I will
say that that is the
real difficulty and I I emphasize
especially with early stage companies
that are just running and burning at
both ends everything you just said is
Utopia and it takes the biggest thing
that people don't have in these
companies is
time like it has to has to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be a
tops down this is important otherwise it
just won't happen and it never gets
rewarded never like dude make it get a
part of your incentive programs make it
like a thing because I don't think good
managers get rewarded enough and I don't
think bad man get thrown out enough I so
well said Kelly and and just to like
double down on that point you're exactly
right that like CEOs end up optimizing
for like right now we need to solve a
problem yeah and they're completely
missing the forest from the trees which
is like well if you invest in these
people not only will they be able to
solve that problem then they're going to
be able to solve the future problems I
think a lot of CEOs believe that you
could just recruit your way out of all
of these messes yes and it turns out
that like you don't know what you're
getting when you're recruiting right you
don't know if they're gonna they're GNA
actually operate like you want them to
as as part of your culture and so if you
have people internally that you can lean
on and grow and invest in there is no
better use of your time yes the the
amount of money and time
and like you know holding the business
back that it takes to get rid of someone
hire someone new ramp them up have them
understand the nuances and how the cloth
is of the culture I mean it literally
wastes millions of dollars and people
don't think about that because it's not
money you can't account for it yeah you
can't because it's Iceberg underneath
the water that no one freaking thinks
like Jesus why are you missing numbers
well like I'm telling you the the people
in the organization it impacts your
business more than you never know and
it's like a Deadly Secret Weapon yeah
you can't see it you can't account for
it but it's so real and and I will tell
you Nolan like we talk about these in
all of our segments like how to partner
with CEOs in these very aggressive very
competitive very high pressure companies
you can't just be like well they don't
get it and they're like you have to
empathize like of course they're under
you're a CEO right of a company and
especially in this macro you have to
start with where they are and then move
it you can't just point at them and say
you're wrong and you don't get it
there's so much pressure and there's so
much that I've felt myself in this role
for 14 years with founder CEOs multiple
yeah and so you have to empathize with
why they're feeling like that so I'll
end my my shtick with the bottom line
for me with all of this stuff hips this
is start with the why not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
activity don't start with changing or
adding or subtracting activity y start
with can you explain it on why you're
doing it can you talk to the C company
at at all hands and explain if you can't
do that easily then don't do anything
yet figure that out first and and be
okay with framing it as an experiment
and be okay doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that makes sense
for you that may not make sense for
Google or Facebook or any other company
it's dependent on the context of the
organization in which you're working so
