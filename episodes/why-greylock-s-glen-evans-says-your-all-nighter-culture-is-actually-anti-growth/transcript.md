What's up everybody? Welcome back to
 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics. Today,
 
another segment of HR Heretics. Today,
Kelly is with her family. Our prayers
 
Kelly is with her family. Our prayers
are going up for her. Kelly, I love you.
 
are going up for her. Kelly, I love you.
I'm thinking about you. I hope all of
 
I'm thinking about you. I hope all of
you are also sending love and prayers
 
you are also sending love and prayers
over to Kelly and her family. Today
 
over to Kelly and her family. Today
we're going to try something a little
 
we're going to try something a little
bit different without Kelly. I'm going
 
bit different without Kelly. I'm going
to give a solo rundown of something that
 
to give a solo rundown of something that
I think has caught a lot of steam
 
I think has caught a lot of steam
recently and this is around working
 
recently and this is around working
styles in Silicon Valley specifically
 
styles in Silicon Valley specifically
with early stage founders. So, Kelly and
 
with early stage founders. So, Kelly and
I have discussed a couple times on the
 
I have discussed a couple times on the
show 996, which means 9:00 a.m. to 9:00
 
show 996, which means 9:00 a.m. to 9:00
p.m. 6 days a week. And it kind of
 
p.m. 6 days a week. And it kind of
started in China. And now we're seeing a
 
started in China. And now we're seeing a
lot of this behavior filter into early
 
lot of this behavior filter into early
stage tech companies in Silicon Valley.
 
stage tech companies in Silicon Valley.
So I've been thinking about this for
 
So I've been thinking about this for
probably like the last 6 to 12 months
 
probably like the last 6 to 12 months
and it just keeps coming up. But I
 
and it just keeps coming up. But I
thought Glenn Evans who leads talent at
 
thought Glenn Evans who leads talent at
Greylock, he was a recruiting leader at
 
Greylock, he was a recruiting leader at
Facebook. Glenn's kind of a he's a
 
Facebook. Glenn's kind of a he's a
legend in the valley. I thought he hit
 
legend in the valley. I thought he hit
it perfectly with his post on LinkedIn
 
it perfectly with his post on LinkedIn
last week. So, I'm going to read that to
 
last week. So, I'm going to read that to
you right now. He said, "Over my entire
 
you right now. He said, "Over my entire
career, and especially in my years at
 
career, and especially in my years at
Greatlock, I've seen many waves in tech
 
Greatlock, I've seen many waves in tech
and hiring trends. Lately, I've noticed
 
and hiring trends. Lately, I've noticed
a new one. Founders proudly and publicly
 
a new one. Founders proudly and publicly
promoting six day plus grinds, sleeping
 
promoting six day plus grinds, sleeping
in the office, and treating the hustle
 
in the office, and treating the hustle
lifestyle as a badge of honor. At first,
 
lifestyle as a badge of honor. At first,
it felt short-sighted. In a market where
 
it felt short-sighted. In a market where
top talent has options, leading with
 
top talent has options, leading with
potential burnout doesn't exactly feel
 
potential burnout doesn't exactly feel
like a winning strategy. And I also
 
like a winning strategy. And I also
realized that this is exactly the kind
 
realized that this is exactly the kind
of environment some people want and
 
of environment some people want and
isn't for everyone. But the more I sat
 
isn't for everyone. But the more I sat
with it, the more I saw the
 
with it, the more I saw the
nuance. After the pandemic, startups and
 
nuance. After the pandemic, startups and
companies swung hard toward remote work,
 
companies swung hard toward remote work,
flexibility, and autonomy. Now the
 
flexibility, and autonomy. Now the
pendulum seems to be swinging back maybe
 
pendulum seems to be swinging back maybe
too far for some toward an in-person
 
too far for some toward an in-person
intensity and all hours work as the new
 
intensity and all hours work as the new
sign of commitment.
 
sign of commitment.
Historically, all successful tech
 
Historically, all successful tech
companies did start this way with an
 
companies did start this way with an
aroundthe-clock work environment. Teams
 
aroundthe-clock work environment. Teams
gave up nights, weekends, and personal
 
gave up nights, weekends, and personal
time to build something exceptional.
 
time to build something exceptional.
That level of commitment can be key to
 
That level of commitment can be key to
building an outlier business. And you
 
building an outlier business. And you
need to make sure hires at the stage are
 
need to make sure hires at the stage are
up for the journey and work cadence. But
 
up for the journey and work cadence. But
here's the problem. It's being marketed
 
here's the problem. It's being marketed
today in a way that feels misaligned to
 
today in a way that feels misaligned to
what an inspiring leader or company
 
what an inspiring leader or company
should do. Some founders act as if
 
should do. Some founders act as if
raising money from top tier VCs means
 
raising money from top tier VCs means
talent will just show up and chase them.
 
talent will just show up and chase them.
They'll post statements reflecting, "We
 
They'll post statements reflecting, "We
work weekends as a badge of pride and
 
work weekends as a badge of pride and
push the idea that others they hire will
 
push the idea that others they hire will
do the same." That's not how you attract
 
do the same." That's not how you attract
all the best people or stand out. In
 
all the best people or stand out. In
reality, this mandated approach likely
 
reality, this mandated approach likely
narrows reach and turns away great
 
narrows reach and turns away great
people before they've had a chance to be
 
people before they've had a chance to be
won over. Sure, some of this creates an
 
won over. Sure, some of this creates an
intentional filter for those allin on
 
intentional filter for those allin on
the lifestyle, but messaging matters.
 
the lifestyle, but messaging matters.
You don't inspire great people by
 
You don't inspire great people by
telling them how hard they'll work. You
 
telling them how hard they'll work. You
inspire them by being someone worth
 
inspire them by being someone worth
following. People go the extra mile when
 
following. People go the extra mile when
they believe in the mission and more
 
they believe in the mission and more

There's a big difference between
 
There's a big difference between
building a culture of intensity around a
 
building a culture of intensity around a
shared purpose versus broadcasting a
 
shared purpose versus broadcasting a
grinded out lifestyle. One builds buyin,
 
grinded out lifestyle. One builds buyin,
the other it just sounds tonedeaf. If
 
the other it just sounds tonedeaf. If
you want people to lean into the work,
 
you want people to lean into the work,
give them something meaningful to lean
 
give them something meaningful to lean
into with clear goals, a compelling
 
into with clear goals, a compelling
product, career growth, ownership, and

most of all, be the kind of leader who
 
most of all, be the kind of leader who
earns their trust. Yes, there is a
 
earns their trust. Yes, there is a
talent pool that might want this cadence
 
talent pool that might want this cadence
without question. But don't forget, the
 
without question. But don't forget, the
true 10xers often get more done by
 
true 10xers often get more done by
working smarter and more efficiently.
 
working smarter and more efficiently.
Turning them away before inspiring them
 
Turning them away before inspiring them
to believe and go the extra mile is
 
to believe and go the extra mile is
shortsighted. I'm not anti-g grind. I'm
 
shortsighted. I'm not anti-g grind. I'm
just pro intentionality because great
 
just pro intentionality because great
teams aren't built on hustle alone.
 
teams aren't built on hustle alone.
They're built on
 
They're built on
belief. So, I think Glenn nailed that
 
belief. So, I think Glenn nailed that
and I think he said it better than I
 
and I think he said it better than I
ever could. But I do have a couple of
 
ever could. But I do have a couple of
things that I wanted to
 
things that I wanted to
add. The first is I think right now with
 
add. The first is I think right now with
these it's primarily early stage
 
these it's primarily early stage
founders where this is showing up and I
 
founders where this is showing up and I
p I would say younger early stage
 
p I would say younger early stage
founders. But before you discount that,
 
founders. But before you discount that,
these are people that tend to change the
 
these are people that tend to change the
world, right? Larry and Sergey were, you
 
world, right? Larry and Sergey were, you
know, building at Stanford. Steve Jobs
 
know, building at Stanford. Steve Jobs
and Waznjak were out of their garage at
 
and Waznjak were out of their garage at
Paul. These were all like kids at the
 
Paul. These were all like kids at the
time, and now they're these idols in the
 
time, and now they're these idols in the
valley. One of the things that that I
 
valley. One of the things that that I
have learned as I've gotten older is I
 
have learned as I've gotten older is I
used to hate when people used agism
 
used to hate when people used agism
against me when I was young. Like, oh,
 
against me when I was young. Like, oh,
like Nolan's too young for that. He
 
like Nolan's too young for that. He
hasn't had enough experience for that
 
hasn't had enough experience for that
yet. And so, you know, now that I am
 
yet. And so, you know, now that I am
starting to age a little bit myself, I
 
starting to age a little bit myself, I
am trying to be extremely cognizant of
 
am trying to be extremely cognizant of
not saying like, oh, well, they're
 
not saying like, oh, well, they're
they're young. They'll figure it out.
 
they're young. They'll figure it out.
Now, experience is life's best teacher.
 
Now, experience is life's best teacher.
We all know that. But these are the
 
We all know that. But these are the
people that are going to be changing the
 
people that are going to be changing the
world and that are going to be building
 
world and that are going to be building
the future tech companies of which all
 
the future tech companies of which all
of us now operate. So the first thing I
 
of us now operate. So the first thing I
want to talk about
 
want to talk about
is is it true that more hours equals
 
is is it true that more hours equals
more productivity? Because that's the
 
more productivity? Because that's the
underlying thing here that these
 
underlying thing here that these
founders are getting at is like well in
 
founders are getting at is like well in
order to reap the rewards you have to
 
order to reap the rewards you have to
put in the time. And I'll say
 
put in the time. And I'll say
this, there is no substitute for time.
 
this, there is no substitute for time.
You must put the time in regardless of
 
You must put the time in regardless of
anything you do. If you ask Roger
 
anything you do. If you ask Roger
Federer or Serena Williams or Tiger
 
Federer or Serena Williams or Tiger
Woods or any of the amazing worldclass
 
Woods or any of the amazing worldclass
Mount Rushmore professional athletes,
 
Mount Rushmore professional athletes,
they will all tell you they thought
 
they will all tell you they thought
about it at all hours of the day. They
 
about it at all hours of the day. They
worked on it. They practiced. They
 
worked on it. They practiced. They
dreamed about it. It just never ended
 
dreamed about it. It just never ended
for them. And in the world that we live
 
for them. And in the world that we live
in with careers, we have been sold a a
 
in with careers, we have been sold a a
box. Like the career is in this box,
 
box. Like the career is in this box,
your life is in this box here. And we
 
your life is in this box here. And we
try and have these, you know, these
 
try and have these, you know, these
ridges between them to where work
 
ridges between them to where work
doesn't spill into life. One of my takes
 
doesn't spill into life. One of my takes
is I I think that's actually like the
 
is I I think that's actually like the
fastest way to unhappiness. I tried to
 
fastest way to unhappiness. I tried to
live that way for a very long time and
 
live that way for a very long time and
it just didn't work. And it turns out
 
it just didn't work. And it turns out
the thing that worked for me may not
 
the thing that worked for me may not
work for you, but the thing that worked
 
work for you, but the thing that worked
for me was actually like leaning into
 
for me was actually like leaning into
the things that I enjoyed about work and
 
the things that I enjoyed about work and
not feeling guilty about those things.
 
not feeling guilty about those things.
And then also figuring out my
 
And then also figuring out my
priorities. And this is the thing that I
 
priorities. And this is the thing that I
don't think people are talking about
 
don't think people are talking about
when we're talking about the amount of
 
when we're talking about the amount of
hours. I think if you're like, you know,
 
hours. I think if you're like, you know,
under 27, 28, this is exactly what you
 
under 27, 28, this is exactly what you
should be doing. I did it. It worked for
 
should be doing. I did it. It worked for
me. A lot of people do this and it works
 
me. A lot of people do this and it works
for them. And when you go allin, there's
 
for them. And when you go allin, there's
a couple of benefits that you can get.
 
a couple of benefits that you can get.
One is that you're building these super
 
One is that you're building these super
deep
 
deep
relationships. Another is is that
 
relationships. Another is is that
ultimately when you reflect back on
 
ultimately when you reflect back on
those moments and how crazy they were,
 
those moments and how crazy they were,
for me it was at Door Dash and we were
 
for me it was at Door Dash and we were
putting in a lot of
 
putting in a lot of
hours and at the time I was like
 
hours and at the time I was like
constantly exhausted, right? like
 
constantly exhausted, right? like
basically on Cal Train and then like it
 
basically on Cal Train and then like it
was kind of like a blur of a day like in
 
was kind of like a blur of a day like in
the office and then after my third
 
the office and then after my third
coffee I'd finally like rev it up then
 
coffee I'd finally like rev it up then
I'd be like back on Cal Train home at
 
I'd be like back on Cal Train home at
like 10 working until 1 and then up and
 
like 10 working until 1 and then up and
doing it again the next day and it like
 
doing it again the next day and it like
at the time it was nuts and it sounds
 
at the time it was nuts and it sounds
nuts to recite it back today but it's
 
nuts to recite it back today but it's
some of my fondest memories. I built
 
some of my fondest memories. I built
these amazing relationships with people.
 
these amazing relationships with people.
I grew faster in my career than I
 
I grew faster in my career than I
otherwise would have. I had a ton of
 
otherwise would have. I had a ton of
fun. And so the thing I think about now
 
fun. And so the thing I think about now
is that I no longer can do that because
 
is that I no longer can do that because
of my life priorities. I have a wife. I
 
of my life priorities. I have a wife. I
have kids. I have friends. I have
 
have kids. I have friends. I have
family. Like these are now people that I
 
family. Like these are now people that I
am going to prioritize and they are
 
am going to prioritize and they are
going to get my
 
going to get my
time. But when I was
 
time. But when I was
 
wife.
 
wife.
That's how it was. I think every person
 
That's how it was. I think every person
at that time who was OG and successful
 
at that time who was OG and successful
did. And that was okay. Like that was a
 
did. And that was okay. Like that was a
tradeoff that I was willing to make at
 
tradeoff that I was willing to make at
that time
 
that time
because we were on it. It was like no no
 
because we were on it. It was like no no
other place would have given me that
 
other place would have given me that
amount of
 
amount of
responsibility, that amount of autonomy
 
responsibility, that amount of autonomy
and ownership. And so I wanted to go all
 
and ownership. And so I wanted to go all
and it was a choice I was making
 
and it was a choice I was making
consciously. And I think a lot of people
 
consciously. And I think a lot of people
when they hear 996 or you know founders
 
when they hear 996 or you know founders
like you know essentially requiring
 
like you know essentially requiring
 
they don't get it right. They don't
 
they don't get it right. They don't
understand what's going on there. And
 
understand what's going on there. And
for me I'm kind of like I actually
 
for me I'm kind of like I actually
really appreciate that these founders
 
really appreciate that these founders
are being real about what it's like to
 
are being real about what it's like to
work at these companies today. It
 
work at these companies today. It
doesn't mean 5 years from now after they
 
doesn't mean 5 years from now after they
achieve true depth in product market fit
 
achieve true depth in product market fit
that they have significant revenue that
 
that they have significant revenue that
they need to start really scaling you
 
they need to start really scaling you
know their teams and their operations
 
know their teams and their operations
that they can't change they can totally
 
that they can't change they can totally
change that happened at Door Dash we
 
change that happened at Door Dash we
matured as an
 
matured as an
organization but I do think there is
 
organization but I do think there is
something around this notion
 
something around this notion
of you know being early and needing to
 
of you know being early and needing to
put time in that is true. And so I'm
 
put time in that is true. And so I'm
just happy that these founders are
 
just happy that these founders are
actually being honest about it when they
 
actually being honest about it when they
speak to candidates.

Second point I want to make is a is a
 
Second point I want to make is a is a
story. And so I met these two 24 year
 
story. And so I met these two 24 year
old founders about six weeks ago. They
 
old founders about six weeks ago. They
raised, you know, $4 million seed round
 
raised, you know, $4 million seed round
from like tier one VCs. And these kids
 
from like tier one VCs. And these kids
are killers. Like they are super smart,
 
are killers. Like they are super smart,
super well spoken. They have
 
super well spoken. They have
Riz. I just enjoyed these guys a lot in
 
Riz. I just enjoyed these guys a lot in
our 45minute conversation. And they're
 
our 45minute conversation. And they're
trying to hire a head of engineering.
 
trying to hire a head of engineering.
And so, you know, they start talking to
 
And so, you know, they start talking to
me about like what they're optimizing
 
me about like what they're optimizing
for. The company right now is 12 people.
 
for. The company right now is 12 people.
They are early to product market fit. I
 
They are early to product market fit. I

engineering. They're going to hire call
 
engineering. They're going to hire call
it like five to seven more engineers.
 
it like five to seven more engineers.
And so, when they were describing to me
 
And so, when they were describing to me
the head of engineering that they were
 
the head of engineering that they were
optimized for, they're like, "Well, I
 
optimized for, they're like, "Well, I
want somebody who's managed 40 people,
 
want somebody who's managed 40 people,
who's worked on an analogous product,

And so it brings me to my final point,
 
And so it brings me to my final point,
which
 
which
is, are you willing to accept the
 
is, are you willing to accept the
trade-off? This is life. I say it all
 
trade-off? This is life. I say it all
the time. Life is a series of
 
the time. Life is a series of
trade-offs. So, one last story for you
 
trade-offs. So, one last story for you
guys. I was connected to one of the
 
guys. I was connected to one of the
fastest growing companies right now.
 
fastest growing companies right now.
Everyone's heard this company's name.
 
Everyone's heard this company's name.
They're building in person in San
 
They're building in person in San
Francisco. Recruiting is their number
 
Francisco. Recruiting is their number
one problem. One of my friends reaches
 
one problem. One of my friends reaches
out and says, "Hey, like will you talk
 
out and says, "Hey, like will you talk
to these guys?" like they need help with
 
to these guys?" like they need help with
recruiting Millie Pat. I'm like, "Hell
 
recruiting Millie Pat. I'm like, "Hell

literally respond on Easter. I'm like,
 
literally respond on Easter. I'm like,
"Hey, I can jump on tonight. I can jump
 
"Hey, I can jump on tonight. I can jump
on tomorrow. I didn't have anything
 
on tomorrow. I didn't have anything
going on those evenings." And I just
 
going on those evenings." And I just
knew like this is one of those companies
 
knew like this is one of those companies
that's going to appreciate somebody
 
that's going to appreciate somebody
who's willing to lean in and understand
 
who's willing to lean in and understand
how they
 
how they
operate. So the founder gets back and is
 
operate. So the founder gets back and is
basically like, "Hey, I like you're the
 
basically like, "Hey, I like you're the
perfect candidate. I want to hire you
 
perfect candidate. I want to hire you
for my head of talent." And I was like,
 
for my head of talent." And I was like,
"Hey, I'm I'm flattered. there's not a
 
"Hey, I'm I'm flattered. there's not a
world in which I'm taking that job, but

six to eight weeks." And he's like,
 
six to eight weeks." And he's like,
"Yeah, yeah, no worries."
 
"Yeah, yeah, no worries."
And so this
 
And so this
is I had a little bit of like judgment
 
is I had a little bit of like judgment
against them of like is recruiting
 
against them of like is recruiting
really your biggest problem if like you
 
really your biggest problem if like you
don't want to talk about it at all like
 
don't want to talk about it at all like

okay maybe maybe not but I do appreciate
people who just willingly accept those
 
people who just willingly accept those
trade-offs like we only want to build in
 
trade-offs like we only want to build in
person we only want to meet people in
 
person we only want to meet people in
person all I'm optimized for is this
 
person all I'm optimized for is this
thing right now and so the more I sat
 
thing right now and so the more I sat
with it the more that I really
 
with it the more that I really
appreciated this person's focus
 
appreciated this person's focus
And you know, I think a few years ago, I
 
And you know, I think a few years ago, I
would have been like, what a dumbass and
 
would have been like, what a dumbass and
projecting like my my desires and the
 
projecting like my my desires and the
way I would do things onto this person.
 
way I would do things onto this person.
But the other piece is, you know, humans
 
But the other piece is, you know, humans
need to feel pain in order to
 
need to feel pain in order to
grow. And so there's two pieces that
 
grow. And so there's two pieces that
might be true here. One is that he's
 
might be true here. One is that he's
right and that, you know, by not talking
 
right and that, you know, by not talking
to me, he might find the answer faster
 
to me, he might find the answer faster
because he's
 
because he's
focused. The other piece that could be
 
focused. The other piece that could be
true is that maybe he's wrong. And the
 
true is that maybe he's wrong. And the
way that he's going to figure out that
 
way that he's going to figure out that
he's wrong is to experience some pain.
 
he's wrong is to experience some pain.
And I've said this on the show a few
 
And I've said this on the show a few
times, my daughter is this way, I'm this
 
times, my daughter is this way, I'm this
way. You know, like rules are invented
 
way. You know, like rules are invented
by people. And I think personalities
 
by people. And I think personalities
like us tend to like step on the line
 
like us tend to like step on the line
and see where the line is and to
 
and see where the line is and to
continue to test it. And that's
 
continue to test it. And that's
generally a good thing. Like that is
 
generally a good thing. Like that is
essentially what tech has done for the
 
essentially what tech has done for the
last three decades. That is how we got
 
last three decades. That is how we got
the iPhone, right? That is how we've
 
the iPhone, right? That is how we've
gotten these amazing products that we
 
gotten these amazing products that we
use every single day is like founders
 
use every single day is like founders
are just stepping on these lines and
 
are just stepping on these lines and
seeing how far the boundary goes. And so
 
seeing how far the boundary goes. And so

my message to you guys today is like
whether you like 996, whether you hate
