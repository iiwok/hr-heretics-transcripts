all right what's up everybody Welcome
Back To HR Heretics today we're going to
cover the future of management there's a
couple reasons why so Kelly and I have
been talking about these big changes
that are happening right now in Tech
over the course of the last year started
with our conversation with Tomas and he
was like talking about span of control
and flatter orgs in the last week I've
seen two really interesting instances so
one is is Jon hang who's the CEO of
Nvidia he infamously has 60 direct
reports and doesn't do one-on once and
so we'll talk about that but then the
second one which I just heard this
morning on my way into work was the CPO
and founder of canva on Lenny's podcast
saying that they don't have
managers they have coaches
and when Lenny did the double click was
like are these like outside of the
organization or inside of the
organization the canvas CPO was like
they're inside the org and it turns out
we have 800 or a thousand of them which
sounds a lot like managers to me but
anyways I feel like things are starting
to change and there's this bigger Revolt
happening around the traditional way of
work and the way that we've worked but
now we're starting to see some of these
ideas and now the second order effects
and the trade-offs of those ideas MH so
Kelly what's your take what you where do
you think we're going I like the new
ideas in my simple brain I I would I was
thinking about this and I think a lot of
this stuff that we're seeing out there
coaches not managers right Mastery not
levels career I mean it's kind of tweaks
on what's been
before but we didn't do it that great
before so we're going to call it
something different and tweak it a bit
so I don't mean to be cynical here but I
think there's a lot of stuff that worked
well with the stuff before some stuff
that didn't work well and I think we
tweaking the name and saying it's
something else but for example if I
listen to how he talked about coaches
and let's just put it into eight bullets
Nolan that's the definition of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
manager it's agree we don't like
managers that are shitty managers like
we we like HR we don't like bad HR so
yeah it's just look people like this
stuff can work and it can work well
but I think we're seeing people saying
let's tweak the parts that haven't
worked well and maybe renaming it which
is fine okay so I my take is on the
Nvidia situation so 60 direct reports he
doesn't do one-on ones I posted this on
LinkedIn and there was a really good
discussion in the comment thread my take
is actually I love that we we've
actually been doing this in my company
and I don't meet one-on-one with my
direct reports the the comments in
LinkedIn I think did a really good job
of Des describing the trade-off of the
downside which is on the positive side
you have autonomy and you don't have to
like have this person who's meeting with
you every week you have more time and
then with decision making is is
distributed everyone gets to hear the
problems there's no asymmetry of
information all that stuff is really
good the downside is like what about
career conversations and it turns out
like when you report to a CEO you don't
have career conversation that's been my
experience Kelly has that been your
experience too oh totally yeah so I
think like when you report to the CEO
like just you don't have career
conversations but like imagine a world
to where you operationalize that lower
in New
York and I can see a world to where
one-on ones make sense like every six
weeks every eight weeks but like this
notion that we do one-on ones every week
because that's the way that good quote
unquote good managers run their orgs I
don't know if that's true like I've
struggled with on ones of like what are
we going to talk about this week but I I
don't want to be an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and cancel
the meeting and it's just like these
recurring things that we've done because
we it's yeah maybe we don't do them and
maybe we try something new and I like
that aspect of it I I do that too but
let's not throw the baby at with the
bathwater because what you just said was
All or Nothing let's like go from these
silly every weekly meetings which I
agree like I've been known for like
setting them up and being like do we
need
this but being like we're never going to
have this I think that's silly as well
right it's just like that episode when
Chamas said get rid of HR it doesn't
just go away like the need for that work
will be displaced elsewhere and when I
say that you get rid of managers you
don't have one-on ones like that shit's
got to go somewhere so e even if it's as
is as you need every two every four
weeks whatever it is I do think there is
a need for that and I don't think it's
as simple as like we're so radical we're
going to throw it away and I will
challenge because we've all seen those
companies I've been I I've coached a lot
of CEOs where they say that they don't
have HR they're very flat everyone's
autonomous then they call me 100 150
people and they're like I'm losing my
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mind I'm spending 12 hours a day
on people's stuff because we don't have
managers all this shit's coming to me so
I'm just saying as always I think the
truth is somewhere in the middle but I
do agree with the evolution yeah so I'm
actually not so I actually think there
is like a V2 of this that isn't Jensen I
never do one-on ones but it's like a if
say um I saw Kyle Tibbits post um in my
comments and Kyle is the CMO of wander
and he was like I'm doing this with my
team so then I started thinking about
okay the CMO of wander probably has
eight to 10 people on his team and he
doesn't do one-on ones now well he
probably needs to do a one-on-one every
every 6 to 12 weeks somewhere in that
zone to just have the career
conversation to build the relationship
and the trust that you can't do in a
group setting that isn't done as
effectively there yeah but everything
else I C and also just to be clear what
we do at my compan is like we do just
sporadic phone call like we pick up the
phone and call each other which is so
much more effective than like slacking
or like just pick up the phone I think
four times in the last week I've been
like listen just call me I can't Ty so
much yeah it's like humans are great
that way and also like it's spontaneous
like let's optimize for spontaneity when
we need it versus oh this is on the
calendar and I abide by the calendar
because we've always had this meeting
which doesn't make any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sense
well yes hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that did digitally
engaging employees is the number one
concern for CEOs as companies go hybrid
but as hybrid is quickly becoming the
norm it's easy for workplaces to start
feeling a little less human yet
delighting a digital Workforce is
possible and it can even be dare we say
fun that's where work Vivo zoom's
employee experience platform comes in if
you've ever recoiled at the thought of a
static internet that looks like
something you buil in 1995 using Ms
paint have no fear work Vivo is a
dynamic intuitive accessible and mobile

Dollar General virgin and more have

other features help Elevate the employee

and tell a Nolan and Kelly from HR
heretic sent
you let's also not forget about the
skill set and like the capability of
these people to handle something like
that right so Some Humans some managers
some employees are better communicators
they're more skilled at this stuff and
others they'll take this and be like I'm
free we never have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk about
stuff you know what I mean and that's
when it could go wrong and we've talked
about why do we have all these silly HR
programs and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in place a
lot of it is a forcing function for
people not just managers individual
contributors as well that without that
they wouldn't do the things that they
need to do as far as communication
feedback so that's the other side of it
is if you take it away some people will
be like we're done forever I never have
to do my
homework and I wonder about that because
you're right in today's construct in the
future what we will start to see for
companies that do want this is they will
assess for candidates that can operate
in the
environment and so what I mean by that
is is like if you need your handheld
and you need a weekly one-on-one and a
company's we don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do one-on
ones you're not going to be successful
there yep and that's great and now we go
back to what we talked about a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
year ago be clear on who you are yeah be
clear on your values and how you're
going to
operate someone we're gonna use AI
instead of talking okay that's a whole
another okay so let me hit on the canva
thing really fast because it's a again
good branding like it's got a little bit
of Shopify mastery uh to it um it's
clearly just managers just rebranded as
coaches but Lenny's question I thought
was really interesting which was are you
saying you have external coaches for
your
employees and I've thought about this
just with Continuum we had 1500 experts
or whatever it was and we had a couple
of companies do this for high performers
because they didn't have somebody inside
of the company that the high performer
could learn from and so they they
leveraged like a you to go work with a
firsttime head of people and I've seen
that work out amazingly well and that's
like an angle on like instead of me
having as a CEO for example a one-on-one
with my direct reports What If instead
all of my direct reports got a like a
functional coach that I thought was
world class and we have like these six
to n month engagements and they get a
new one every six to9 months that is an
interesting thing that I have haven't
seen tried that I think is going to be
tried here in the next couple of years
but like how is that different than
Executive coaching we just talked in
Nathan about because because I think
Executive coaches are a little bit more
focused on soft skills as opposed to
functional expertise gotcha okay okay so
like a fun I think that's tried yeah
yeah okay so like a functional Wing
person that helps that leader stand Jak
Jake leads go to market for us and so I
can imagine world to where like we get
Jake yes a you know go to market expert
at the problem we're solving for like
six months but then like rotating to you
know you solve new problems as you earn
the rate to solve new ones right and so
like rotates to the next yeah so I I can
speak to that by experience I've done
that probably about five times with as
which side as like coach or operator no
the mentor the coach so you know like a
monthly retainer you pair up with a head
of people that's like deer in headlights
or needs a little help and you're yeah
co-working with them um we would meet
with the CEO sometimes and the three of
us would talk which was like amazing
Kryptonite like model and I am surprised
a lot more people don't do it it can
work really well the only thing I'd say
is like these coaches have to scrub in
fast they have to be able to like
understand the context they can't be the
consultant Bobs of let me assess you for
four month like you have to get in there
and be like like what are you all trying
to do and speak their language almost an
executive at the table so it can work
really well I've I've been a part of it
it's really fun scrubbing fast I'm going
to steal that for sure but that's a it's
exactly right like you have to be able
to go from zero to full context to then
adding value within a couple of weeks
and this is the role that like VC's some
of them invest in largely in go to
market they'll have them
but like on the talent side most of them
have talent partners that are more
recruiting focused right like my dream
job would be hanging out in a portfolio
and being that scrubber inner Boom for
the whole portfolio and I haven't seen a
lot of folks invest in that and to your
point that might be something I think
it's a smart investment for the future
for sure yep so let us know what you
guys think I mean things are starting to
happen like Kelly and I have been
talking about this for a year now and I
think we're starting to see some people
play around with some of these
experiments and so not only let us know
what you think but let us know what you
see we've seen the Nvidia thing I just
saw the canva thing this morning let us
know who's doing interesting stuff
because that's who we want to talk to on
the Pod and that's where we want our
feedback to come from awesome thanks all
