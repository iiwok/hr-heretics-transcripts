# Why Zapier Requires 100% AI Fluency (And How They Measure It)

## Transcript

 
One of our biggest episodes this year
was with Zapier's CPO Brandon Samoot.
For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, he demonstrates AI agents
automating bar raiser interviews and
performance reviews while explaining
Zapier's four-level AI fluency
framework. What's up everybody? Welcome
back to another episode of HR Heretics.
Brandon Simo, what's up man? It's good
to see you. Where I want to start with
you is talk about like AI fluency and
you had said on LinkedIn that AI fluency
is a requirement for 100% of new hires
at Zapier.
Why is that the case and how do you guys
go about measuring that?
&gt;&gt; AI fluency is a requirement for everyone
we're hiring into the company for a
couple reasons. The first is it's
essential for fulfilling our mission,
right? Zapier's mission is to make
automation work for everyone and AI is a
meaningful new way for us to make that
mission real for so many more people. A
second reason why that matters to me is
more about like Zapier's
tacit commitment to people we hire. You
think about if you're in the job market
right now and you're thinking about
whether to go to this company or that
company. You know, a lot of us have a
leading sense that wherever we spend the
next few years of our career is going to
have a lot to do with the kind of
opportunities we have for many years
after that. And gosh, I would really
encourage all of us like make sure we go
somewhere where that's actively
investing in making sure that we know
how to use AI to supercharge the thing
that we do best in the world or at least
at work. Granted, I was listening to a
podcast on the way up to the city today
and similar thing, but a company was
saying it's a requirement for folks to
come in with some sort of AI. You know,
I'll use fluidity because we're using it
here, but their bar was curiosity and
I'm wondering if yours is something
different.
&gt;&gt; You have to be a little bit more than
curious to get a job at Zapier, but I
appreciate that as a starting condition.
So, I would call a curiosity like
necessary but not sufficient if that
makes sense. At Zapier, we have kind of
like four levels on our AI fluency
rubric. And the first is unacceptable.
It just means you just you're not both
from a skill and from a will
perspective. The second is capable. And
when we mean capable, that means like
you have some of the skills and some of
the knowhow of like how to apply AI in
your daily work. The third and next
level in the rubric comes up. That's
called adaptive. Adaptive is oh no,
you're applying it, but you're applying
it primarily to the work as it's
conventionally done.
So it's like, you know, the work is
traditionally done a certain way. I'm
using AI to practically improve my
productivity or the quality of my
output. And by the way, like that's
pretty impactful.
But it gets even better because the top
tier in the AI fluency rubric is called
transformational. And that's for folks
that are showing us that not only do
they know how to use AI to impact the
work they do as it's traditionally done,
they are also able to completely rethink
how the work gets done in the first
place. So it's almost like a like a
clean safe, but you're starting more
from, you know, like you're kind of zero
basing the whole thing and being like,
gosh, if we were to start from scratch
with the tools and know how we now have,
how would we do this work?
&gt;&gt; Thank you for breaking that down. A lot
of the issues I see out there right now
is just literally like an inability to
simply break things down so we can touch
it and feel it and that's really
helpful.
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, let's get into the meat
of this. So, how are you guys deploying
AI and what do you think are like the
most interesting use cases you want to
show?
&gt;&gt; What we're looking at is Zapier agents,
right? And just to define agents really
quickly, agent has the kind of
underlying LLM capability that we all
know and love, but with the ability to
automate tasks on your behalf. So at
Zapier, like many organizations, we do a
bar raiser interview. This is a this is
intended both to apply additional rigor
to hiring. We don't hire a lot of people
every year, so everyone should be
amazing. A bar raising addition to the
team. And importantly, it's it's done by
an exec.
&gt;&gt; Is that Calele exec or VP plus? Like how
do you guys think about it?
&gt;&gt; It's VP plus. Yeah, it's like department
heads effectively.
&gt;&gt; And and just contextually, how many
employees is Zapier?
&gt;&gt; 730.
&gt;&gt; 730. And how many VPs do you guys have?
&gt;&gt; VP plus. We have 10.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was my eyebrows just raised.
&gt;&gt; Love to see that. Now, as great as these
bar raiser interviews are, they're a
bear to prepare for when you're like a
busy exec because you're supposed to be
looking across all of the prior
interviews and scorecards and
identifying like specific things to dig
into. The nonI assisted way of doing
this looks very inconsistent in
practice. When you watch there's recency
bias, like maybe I'm reading quickly
through the scorecard and stopping more
on this one. Like humans are messy and
so is preparing for a bar raiser without
a co-pilot.
&gt;&gt; I've had this experience a million times
by the way. It's like, "Oh, hey, Nolan
has to interview this person and five
minutes before is when I'm scrambling
and looking at their LinkedIn and trying
to get my act together."
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly right. And
so what this agent does is I will point
it at a series of scorecards for a
fictional candidate that we'll look at
in a second and it will draft the bar
raiser interview guide. It's reading all
of the data in this browser tab about
Leslie and everything we know about her
from our interviews. It's also looking
at her resume and it's creating the
interview guide. And what's interesting
about this one is it's been it's been
prompted to not only add questions
that'll help us like really round out
our perspective on the candidate, but
it's explaining why it chose that
question. That's incredible because
before I saw this, I was like, "The
questions are great, but you're still
flying blind." Like, why are we doing
this? What are we worried about? What
are we trying to validate or devalidate?
&gt;&gt; That's right. The speed of iteration is
so fast. Like, you know, I'd like an
extra sentence on why each of these
questions was chosen. All you got to do
is come right back on here and update
your prompt and then retest. It takes
takes three or four minutes. And so
Brandon, there's like a spectrum here.
Some companies for their bar raiser
interview have like the exact same
questions, but it doesn't change the
fact that you actually want the full
download of what's happened in every
conversation. I met with Joe Ed recently
who runs he runs recruiting at HBIQ and
one of the things I learned from him is
they're actually recording all of the
interviews with Metaview taking the
transcript putting the transcript into
chat GPT and then with the backend
prompts basically like saying like
here's context on our org on our product
how do you think they're going to fit in
what are the yellow flags what are the
green flags what are the red flags but
another spectrum is go summarize these
interviews tell tell me about this
candidate via the resume, right? And you
could do that with one click every
single time, you know, an hour before an
interview. And so there's just so many
different ways that you can actually
tinker with this thing, right?
&gt;&gt; 100%. You also have a lot of choices
around how much of the human you want in
the loop. After it generated the
interview guide, it stopped. It asked me
to read it and say if I liked what I saw
or wanted to make tweaks.
if you tested this enough and you're
like 99 times out of 100 it stops and
asks me if I'd like to make tweaks and I
say no because it's just it's right
there. It's spot on. You can take that
step out and it will automatically
create the doc.
&gt;&gt; And so this this one I use regularly
when we're hiring folks into the people
team at Zapier.
&gt;&gt; This is what I've been say. I would show
up unprepared to 95% of the interviews
where I was the final interviewer. I'd
say 97 out of a hundred times the
candidates's getting green lit from me.
And this is a way to actually add value
into that process without me being the
person who's like, "Oh my god, I don't
have enough time in the day to prepare
for these things."
&gt;&gt; Well, now let's talk about another I
think something all of us can relate
with, which is we're writing whatever
our company's version of our performance
review is. And usually that includes a
self-reflection, right? I'm actually
about to do it next week for myself and
I will tell you like I got to go back
into the vault to like remember all the
you know what did I what did I do what
did I learn accomplishments and so on
and this is another place where like
humans are messy and imperfect and you
know like we're all you know apt to have
you know recency bias forgetfulness so
one of the things we're curious about is
like how can we help automate evidence
collection for coaching performance
reviews what I'm trying to solve for is
like when I get a piece of feedback or
when something good happens that I've
contributed to, I want a running
documentation of all of that so that I
don't have the blank page problem when
it comes time to write my whatever it
might be, my self-evaluation for a
performance cycle, my case for
promotion.
Zap year does almost all of its
communication in Slack. What I want to
do, I want to use a very specific
reaction in Slack and that's what this
trigger is. So, when Brandon Slack
account adds the blob notes reaction to
anything in Slack,
&gt;&gt; it's an emoji.
&gt;&gt; It's an emoji. It's an emoji. And I'll
show it to you in a minute. And when I
tag anything in Slack with this emoji,
then do what's in the instructions,
right? So, it's like classic prompting
like roll
trigger. So, again, there's the trigger
again. when I, you know, react to a
thread, analyze the conversation,
create a summary focused on what it's
about, how it relates to my work or
performance, and then it includes an
example of what I'm looking for.
I actually added this one last week.
Include a link back to the Slack comment
so I have it for reference as I'm
clicking through if I want like more of
the original material. So, it's just
it's amazing, right?
&gt;&gt; Which, by the way, you didn't have when
you first built this. That's what I like
the thing I got hung up on a couple
weeks ago was letting perfect be the
enemy of good and just like get going
and then when you realize oh it's
actually not perfect here go make the
edit which takes 30 seconds right
&gt;&gt; that's exactly it and in fact that's
exactly what I did and it really did
take literally 30 seconds to make this
update and then I tested it right and
that's one of the things of course you
know we're finding so helpful is like
you kind of treat an agent like you
would an employee right I'm giving this
a job to do. I think I'm being clear in
my instructions. It's time to test. But
the speed of like build, test, learn,
and improve is so fast. And again, it
doesn't require like special skills or
at least harder to develop skills.
There's definitely some skilling
involved in this, but wow is it
relatively straightforward to pick up
compared to learning how to code.
The other thing is making me think like
so this is, you know, this is today's
iteration. The future iteration, right,
is probably going to be living in the
background of Slack to where you're not
even going to have to hit this emoji
you're about to show us, right? And it's
going to just kind of be idling back
there. And then you're going to send it
prompts things like, "Hey, what are my
blind spots, right? and how I
communicate with the rest of the team or
like, you know, what do you think I'm
doing really well at or what do you
think I can be better at? And it's just
reading all of Slack all the time and
essentially like filling in your gaps,
being your ondemand coach.
&gt;&gt; You've got it. Yeah, I think that's
right. And in doing so, by the way, like
it that would be like the I think the
highest level like agentic workflow is
it's doing work on your behalf with
little to no human triggering. Well,
then also I had is is a person, right?
Imagine, you know, Nolan, you're you're
pulling up me and I'm an AI agent and
I'm talking just like this and I'm not
only doing all that, but now I'm talking
through the feedback with you. You're
almost like mocking through a
conversation or going into more detail
about the feedback.
&gt;&gt; That's right. We're gonna be testing
something internally in the second half
of this year along these lines where
it's kind of like, you know, coaching in
the flow of work would be a good way to
describe it where it notices that
something's been discussed or
something's going on in a meeting and it
will basically say, "Hey, sounds like
XYZ came up in that meeting. If you're
looking, for example, for a way to like
give some feedback about that, like do
you want to talk about that? Do you want
to roleplay it?" Or, "Hey, like you
know, looks like you were facilitating
that meeting. I noticed that it didn't
sound like the next steps were super
clear. Here's what I mean by that. Like
here's what I thought I heard. Like is
that right? Like if if you think that's
if you think there's something to that,
you may want to, you know, follow up
with the group, make sure those next
steps are clear.
&gt;&gt; Wow. I mean, so all three of us, by the
way, do coaching. And you know, you can
imagine, right, if you have like all of
the NDAs and like legal BS figured out,
but you can actually imagine like
coaching clients opting in for these
sorts of things and you're getting
actually data from like what's actually
happening versus what the coaching
client is telling you and to help
improve. So, it's I think a lot of times
people get really worried about oh my
god like the agents are taking over
versus really like you know it's like
steroids and like really turning this
coach or whoever it is like using the
data into more of somebody who can
actually help you and help your
performance.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. Meta View is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metav's suite of AI agents works for you
at every stage of the hiring process.
Their platform powers instant job post
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes
all of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
MeteView covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Deal, 11 Labs, and Quora and check out
Metaview. Just head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts or get started for free. You'll
be uprunning an AI enabled in minutes. I
talked to a founder this morning who's I
mean I feel like these are you know this
is incredible. Xavier is incredible. I
talked to a founder this morning who's
trying to create that and like a coach
in the workflow like a person and I said
you know the the day that someone
figures out how to how to create 10 of
me in an organization that can talk like
this to 10 people at once 100 people at
once in a company on demand and their
workflow.
&gt;&gt; It's coming.
&gt;&gt; It's it's super interesting. And so you
know take a look at the at the screen
right here. So this is this is Slack at
Zapier. This is our general channel, our
all company channel. And you'll see Wade
does a what he calls his Friday five.
It's like five really interesting things
going on around the company. And he had
a sixth one this past week. And because
we did a big launch moment for what
we're calling HR by Zapier, you're
really starting to package up some of
the use cases that we're finding helpful
inside our own company in making it
easier for other people or HR teams to
uh put those to work in their
organizations. And so it was just a
shout from Wade to the team and I. And
if you'll notice right down here, oh,
there's that reaction blob notes. That's
the trigger when I use that emoji. Not
when someone else uses it. I use it.
That's the trigger for the agent. And
with that in mind, I'll show you what
happens.
Here we go.
 
So, when that happens,
I have a Google running Google doc
and it will drop in the summary. Now, I
did this yesterday because it takes for
it to run the loop. It takes like 15
minutes or so to pick up on it because I
don't have it running. have it running
like periodically to save some compute.
But you can see right here when I
triggered it yesterday, got a little
summary of what it was about,
little context on on the overall kind of
wrapper, and then a link directly back
to the message that the evidence is
pulled from. And you can imagine using
this throughout, you know, whether you
do semiannual reviews or annual reviews,
just tagging stuff up throughout an
extended period of time. And then when
it's time to sit down and make that
promotion case or write your
self-reflection for your performance
review, like you've got what is
ultimately the thing that takes the most
time if you want to do a really good
review, which is having a, you know,
fairly comprehensive set of evidence to
build on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, my advice to people and
what I tried to do was I I literally
kept a running note, right? And I would
try and add to that thing once a week,
once every couple weeks, but you know,
turns out life happens. you get busy,
you forget, right? You have all the
human problems and you just like don't
do it. Or like maybe you're running from
meeting to meeting and just clicking a
little emoji is a perfect example of
like so much faster, so much easier to
be able to capture what you need to
capture.
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; Sick.
&gt;&gt; Let me make one point about some of
these workflows that y'all were hitting
on earlier indirectly, which is about
employee choice. And you take some of
these workflows, right, like this one.
And there's a big difference between,
you know, our company telling everyone
you got to use it and us like treating
this more like a market, right? which is
if my team makes a credible case for how
this is going to help our people be
great, be recognized, you know, have a
performance review that feels like more
comprehensive, more fair, higher
decision quality, then folks are going
to pull this off the shelf and use it.
Yeah, the effective marketing piece is
actually something I hadn't thought
about and you know said a little bit
differently, Brandon, a lot of CEOs are
saying you must use AI. I better send
this message too and people better be
using it and teaching me how to use it.
But what you guys are doing is saying
like, "No, no, no. Leadership like needs
to be native in this." And we need to do
a great job of teaching everybody how
valuable it is and why it's so dope so
that it's so obvious for them that they
should be using.
&gt;&gt; I think that's the higher bar. I think
it's the right one.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But actually takes leadership
doing real work. And and this is like
this is the this is where we are in this
cycle is like there are very few
companies still that have real life use
cases like Brandon is showing us today.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is this is so helpful. I mean
for for one of the biggest things for me
maybe for the audience is is just to
demystify how
simple these use cases actually are
because again you hear the big cloud of
use AI and HR and everyone gets you know
deer in headlights Google paralyzed and
I understand why but again like we
started the conversation breaking it
down and just unpacking exactly what you
mean so we can touch it and feel it.
It's like, oh my gosh, not only is this
demystifying it, but I want to actually
go do this because I understand
&gt;&gt; just interpersonally, but also even if
you're just even if you were just
interested in maximizing the company's
performance, you want to maintain a
sense of belonging across the
&gt;&gt; and you tinker as you go. Like that's
the other thing I want people to take
away from this is like yeah like test
and stuff like that but like even if you
can't ensuring that there is a human in
the loop step which most of these you
have shown Brandon have a human in the
loop step right you could just do it
live and be like didn't love that one
like let me kick this off right now to
get this off my you know my plate and
then take five minutes to go update the
prompt so then next time it doesn't make
the same mistake.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You know, if you're interested,
I've got one more,
&gt;&gt; please.
&gt;&gt; Okay, this next one is the most
sophisticated build. It's not one that I
built and it's not one I could build
even today, but I'm sharing it to make a
couple points. And the first point right
as I pivot over to it is that, you know,
within a company, you don't need a 100%
of folks to be, you know, deep deep like
power builders of these use cases. You
need enough within each set of use cases
to be able to build and troubleshoot and
maintain the workflows. You know, the
rest of us, you know, we can pull that
stuff off the shelf and put it to work.
And if you think about it that way, it
should really increase our all of our
sense of possibility about what we can
do. So, here's a neat one. This is a AI
one- on-one meeting coach. This is for
managers who in many cases do one-on
ones or or coaching conversations with
their direct reports. And what this one
does is it listens in on those meetings
with the consent of both people. It
tapes notes. It then analyzes those
notes for very specific qualities that
we believe make for a great one-on-one
or proxy. And then it automatically
provides coaching and feedback to the
manager after the meeting.
So, we talked about human in the loop
earlier. The only human in the loop
moment for this one once it's turned on
is hitting the record button. Everything
else is automated.
And you can see here a couple things.
So, this is a workflow that blends
automation with AI. And if we're just to
walk top to bottom here, it's it's, you
know, looking out for the recording once
it's generated. uh it then importantly
waits because Zoom or Microsoft Teams
takes a minute to develop the transcript
after the meeting. So, it's
intentionally waiting for that
transcript to drop. It's then taking the
transcript and then there are a couple
code steps and I give credit to one of
our learning designers here on the
people team, Emily Maybe. She and a
couple teammates put this one together.
But again, Emily and our team, we don't
have developers on our team, but Emily
was able to write Zapier code steps. So
in other words, just write code to do
very specific things that aren't
hardcoded into our automation schema to
do some really interesting things around
structuring the transcript and
reorganizing it, getting clarity on
who's the manager and who's the direct
report. Like it's just pretty incredible
what she
&gt;&gt; calculating the the talk to listen ratio
is really interesting.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah, I mean this is and that's
custom like you know like Emily made
that using code by Zap year with the
assist of an LLM. The other like icing
on the cake here is that as you do more
and more of these one-on- ones and
generate more and more of this feedback
it actually databases it and then
provides thematic feedback about hey
like over the last 90 days in general
here are some themes I'm seeing so you
know here's something to keep doing
here's something to start doing or do
something different. Wow.
&gt;&gt; To give you an example of the output, I
had a one-on-one recently and call it 45
minutes after the meeting once the
transcript was created and the feedback
was synthesized. I get this in Slack.
And you can see here there's like kind
of
&gt;&gt; oh my god,
&gt;&gt; you know, so overall strengths, do
betters, and then the feedback trend
isn't super useful in this example
because I don't have a ton of data in
the table that's aggregating. But you
can imagine if you'd done like 20, 30,
 
over some period of time, you know, you
would get genuinely useful like thematic
feedback.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And you could emoji that or
whatever and put it in your notes that
you were talking about earlier.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This one though, Kelly, is like
this is scaling HRBPS, right? This is
like, hey, we managers suck. Every
company has a problem with shitty
managers, right? It's the hardest thing
because you're not in that room to give
them feedback. What Brandon and his team
are doing here is they're essentially
saying, "Well, as long as you press
record," which again, you know, six
months from now, that's going to be the
default, right? And that's they're not
going to have an option. It's going to
be how we work. What's going to end up
happening here is they're going to get
feedback from AI that is that has the
tinkering on the back end from us to
tell managers exactly what we expect and
what they did well and where they could
grow and then we're going to have it on
our back end as well to be able to
manage all of the things that we can't
see. That is incredible.
&gt;&gt; Well, we said earlier meeting them in
the meeting them in the workflow of
their day
&gt;&gt; in the flow of work. Yeah. Wow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Scaling us and then all right I'm
the HRBP. You give me a hundred of
these. I now use this as an aggregate
dashboard instead of running.
&gt;&gt; Well, actually instead even even Yeah.
So to your point, right? Right, Kelly.
So then the next thing you're going to
do is you're going to say like, okay,
here's all the managers and all the
feedback. Stack rank my best managers.
Like stack rank managers one to 100.
Brandon, this is so cool. Well, you have
so many choices to make around this,
too, because you know, you you get to
choose, you know, is this one of those
kind of on demand, off-the-shelf type of
workflows that folks can choose if they
want to sharpen up their one-on- ones as
a manager? Is it a is it a required
workflow? If it's a required workflow,
you have yet another choice to make.
Actually either way you have an other
choice to make around like are you
collecting the metadata to in fact you
know understand who your most or least
skillful managers are at least as it
relates to doing one-on ones. How does
that influence trust in the workflow?
How does that influence whether folks
actually use it? Like a lot of
interesting things there. Our current
theory of action for this one is we have
kind of a golden path for this so folks
don't have to redo all of this goodness
that Emily and colleagues put together.
No one has to make this up. It's a
template, right? You copy it, you author
your own stuff in and you're good to go.
But it's still on demand. So we don't
require that folks use it right now. We
are making a case again use actually
using like user stories, right? This is
just like marketing, right? It's just
inside your company like anecdotes like
I'm using this here's how it's
sharpening me like etc. And importantly,
we're not currently doing anything with
the data like we're not collecting it in
some extra place. Different ways to
approach it all with their merits and
challenges. One thing I highly recommend
no matter which way organizations go on
a question like this is to be very clear
and transparent with your team about
things like this. What data is being
collected? Where is it being stored? Who
is it for? Who else gets to see it? And
if other people other than just me are
going to see this information, what will
it be and not be used for? And again,
like you can have lots of interesting
conversations around like the right
answers to those questions for a
specific use case and a specific
organization. But the most important
takeaway is be clear and be transparent
because that's the type of thing that
builds trust and inspires folks to try
more of this stuff out over time.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah. It reminds me of, you know,
when I was in high school, we would have
optional practices on sat Saturday and
we we described those practices as mand
optional because like ultimately like
they were kind of mandatory and if
people aren't using it like that's kind
of a signal itself, but what you guys
are doing such a good job of is just
saying like this is the like listen to
these people talk, right? And if you
don't use it after listening to these
people and it's been a couple months
like you know we'll have a conversation
then. But like I love the idea of
encouraging people to use the stuff
that's just off the shelf that you guys
are doing that the people team is adding
value to the organization. And it's like
this is the whole idea is like it's
turning us all into the the Iron Man
suit versus the AI overlords are doing
the job.
Wow. All right, Brandon, where can
people find you?
&gt;&gt; The best place. That's where we're going
to keep sharing use cases and things
we're learning along the way, including
the hard stuff that doesn't work. so you
can see around those corners.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I didn't ask you this before the
show, but we are going to require that
you come on the show every couple of
months and give us the latest updates
and the stuff that you're building so we
can share with the rest of the world.
&gt;&gt; Oh, challenge accepted as a good excuse
to make sure we have a good point of
view on the stuff we want to showcase.
&gt;&gt; Sick. Thanks so much, Brandon.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Brandon.
&gt;&gt; You've got it. Good to be with you.
