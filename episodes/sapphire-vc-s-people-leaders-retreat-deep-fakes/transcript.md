# Sapphire VC’s People Leaders' Retreat & Deep Fakes

## Transcript

What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics. So,
Kelly and I, was it last week? the week
before uh two weeks ago went to the
Sapphire event, the people leader
retreat, which Kelly I am coming to find
is like my favorite people leader event
of the year. Um and so we just want to
give a quick recap. You want to give the
rundown, Kelly, on what happened? Yeah,
it's great. So Sapphire is one of my
favorite VCs. Shout out. been with a
couple of their portfolio companies now
as a CPO over about eight years or so
and still do a lot of work with them.
And Elizabeth Patterson, she was on the
show a while back, those of you who
remember the talent partner over at
Sapphire. She basically hosts a very
intimate retreat every year at her house
in Saratoga, which is great. It's
already kind of a chill atmosphere, very
comfortable. You know, I think it's
capped at around 30 or 40 people, Nolan.
Yeah. This helped me understand, right?
No, no
microphones, no none of that stuff. It's
just one room, right? We're you're all
there. It's kind of like a big circle of
of chatting and a lot of real talk,
right? No recording, no taking it out of
the room and covered a lot of pretty
deep stuff. That's um yeah, was very
raw. So, I think it's the third year of
this. Yeah, I've been the last two. And
I I think it's like a what's the magic
about that event is like it's it's big
enough to where you can break out and
have individual conversations, but not
too big to where like everybody's on
their phone the whole time and not
paying attention to the content. Uh the
other thing is like the the content is
very curated. So, here's a here's the
high level of like what what I thought
was like really interesting. One we did
with Colleen like an hour on what is the
job of a CPO in 2025 which we'll talk
about here in a second. The other one
which we're going to have her on the pod
in a couple of weeks. I heard the
craziest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] story Kelly about we
you and I have not talked about this
about uh a deep fake. So we've been
hearing about these deep fake candidates
a lot. Mhm. Someone happened. They were
representing the
company. So, they were reaching out to
candidates, like cold source candidates,
getting them interested as if that was
the company, getting them through an
interview process, and then extending
offers with the explicit intent to get
the candidates's bank account
information and social security number.
Wow. and then to extort these
candidates.
 
I was like, wild. What? Can you repeat
that again a little slower?
So, literally faking as if you are the
company. So, we've been hearing about
the candidate fakes, right? Like that's
like the thing everyone's talking about.
What I had not heard was like the
company being deep faked and then the
candidate being taken advantage of.
Right. Right. So, it happened to I think
she said six people. Interestingly
enough, like you know, cuz then I was
like, "How'd you find out?" And of
course, the answer is is like, "Well,
like somebody kind of had like a weird
inkling that this wasn't us. They picked
up the phone, they called me, and
they're like, "Hey, like I just got an
offer for you. I just want to make sure
like this is legit." And turned out it
wasn't. And so then the next question is
like, "What the what do you do?" And and
she's like, "Yeah, so we got together as
an exec team. we talk to all these
candidates like you know we kind of like
put our recruiting team on alert but
like you can't like broadcast like even
if you broadcast it on your LinkedIn
potentially candidates won't see it so
it's and I was like did you call the FBI
she's like I did call the FBI I'm like
oh my god so we're having her on the pod
in a couple weeks to talk about this
because like I think this is going to be
the next wave of fraud that we as people
and talent leaders and candidly as
company builders are going to have to
deal with that was the wildest story
that I heard. It's just I I I don't know
about the rest of everyone, but I am
disheartened and overwhelmed. This is
insane, Nolan. This is like I was
telling my mom four years ago. I'm like,
"Listen, don't respond to these emails."
And that, right? I mean, you get elderly
fakes and now we're all getting I almost
I almost fell for an email the other day
and the only reason I didn't do it is my
wife was like, "Look at the bottom at
the twopoint font that has the year from
last year, not this year." I was like,
"What?" It's It's crazy. Yeah. Just
quickly on that topic, it's like I've
been getting I I haven't fallen for it
yet, but I almost clicked it one time
like the text message from Coinbase
saying like, "Your password's been
reset." Like I was like, "Oh." Like I
called my like, "Hey, did you just do
this?" She's like, "No." Um the cra the
other crazy one that happened recently
was uh to Pelleon who led our series A
for Continuum. Um, this DVIG is crazy.
So, normally it's like some crazy ass
email. That's how you can kind of like
figure out like it's scammy. This this
fraudster bought a domain and so it's
normally
pelleonvp.com and they did
 
pelonvps.com and it looked ex they they
had everything else like totally nailed
and like requesting capital from LPS. So
like
nuts, but this is the kind of stuff you
get at this retreat is what we're
saying. Like it's very raw. It's it's
great to kind of go deep with folks. And
we talked about transform the other day.
I mean the diversity of people in this
room. I liked a lot because you have
business leaders, CEOs, board members,
VC partners, talent leaders, people
leaders. It was great. Yeah. So I want
to talk about quickly our segment with
with Colleen which was you know what is
the job of a chief people officer in
 
the audience is there is not one right
way like you know Kelly had a
perspective Colleen had a perspective I
had a perspective audience members had a
perspective and so if you hear people
say like this is the thing this is how
to do this thing like it should be
immediately red flags because it's like
not real. So there is no right way. I
would say the other cliff note for me is
that everything's being rewritten. So
like the job that you had in
 
had in 2020 to 2022 is different from
the job that you currently have today.
And so the I think the big takeaways for
us, Kelly, was like number one, you got
to make sure that you're aligned with
your executive team and like how to get
realigned, especially if like things are
feeling like a little unsettled like how
to actually like go and have this
conversation and like make making it
making the implicit explicit with your
CEO and your executive team. And then
also on that that thread is like you got
to get clear with them on what they
think you should be doing. Um, it's one
thing to say like this is what I think
and you should obviously come with that
and submit that, but you know, I think
the days of like this is what an HR
leader does. I I don't think that's I
don't I don't think it's valid anymore
and I think those days are over. Yeah.
Yeah. I think um there there was a lot
of of talk around it is it is different
in every company. So if you have a
combination of all of all the people
leaders and all the companies and all
the founders, you have every every
combination within that, you know what I
mean? So we talk a lot about forget what
everyone else is saying or the trauma
that you might have had from your last
company of what they said you should be
doing or the potential bliss. It was a
perfect place and you were so happy. Not
everywhere is going to be like that. So
we really talked about the importance of
being clear on what you think the job
is. The three of us talked about some of
those aspects on how we spend our time
and some litmus test things you can do
as far as you know are you spending your
time wisely. Um second on how to sus out
and really understand is it the right
place for you and I said early in my
career 2013 2012 I was not good at that.
I did not do that well and that bit me
hard and we learned from that. And I I
said to the group, I said, "Listen, you
got to spend time with these people. I
don't mean like one dinner and a
six-hour interview day." Like, I'm
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking about hours on hours.
Because I mean, you and I have talked
about this even with each other. The
more time you spend with someone and the
more reps, the less fake they can be,
right? You can't kind of turn it on all
the time forever. So, spend time in
different forums overtime with folks.
And if it's a remote job or hybrid, I
have a client right now and they're
talking about taking a job in a
different state. I'm like, you tell them
you want to go out there for like five
days straight. Totally. And spend time.
And if they bock, you're gone.
So that was something that I learned is
is to spend a lot of time getting to
know um not just what they think about
the company Nolan but who they are as a
person like what they care about what
they value what they think outside of
work and life and all the things because
you're you're living with that person
and most of the time forget about people
leaders but any C level role the main
reason those things don't work out and
we exit those executives usually isn't
because of their technical or functional
skills it's because of the chemistry,
the fit, the relationship, the
philosophies not fitting between the CEO
and that leader. Yep. Totally. The other
interesting thread was
uh how do we think about uh like where
our moral boundary is versus like
running
experiments? And you know, this thread
was really interesting because it hit on
a it hit on something we haven't talked
about, Kelly, which is like I think a
lot of these experiments that founders
and other executives want to run right
now are
inongruent with how HR leaders believe
companies should be run.
And so, uh, it was a great question, um,
from Jasmine who was like, well, how do
how should I think about these things of
like what is like where is my moral
boundary on these things because I'm
coming in with preconceived notions on
like this is the right way to do stuff
and this is like treating people the
right way. And I thought it was like one
of those kind of like eye opening
moments for me. like, oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I
think this is actually happening right
now across the industry, which is
potentially the reason why people are
feeling so
unsettled and and like it was it was a
little bit. So what we discussed was
like what my take on this was like look
number one um you need to understand
where your moral boundaries are and and
this person asked me she was like what
are yours and I was like anything
harassment like obviously it's anything
harassment related right like anything
that like treats in and on purpose
treats people like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm not
signing up for that's a moral boundary
for me and I I won't get along with it.
But the story I told was like when I was
at Carta, the things that one of the
things I learned from Henry is some of
these radical ideas that I thought would
just be like we're going to just fall
flat on our face and look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
in front of the entire company, I was
wrong about. And that really opened up
my aperture for like the the
possibility of what could and thinking
about it instead of what could go wrong,
think about it as like what could go
right. And so we had a great thread on
that. And then you your take on this um
which I've come to appreciate more and
more is the as I as I process it is like
you you frame it as care a little
less. And you know my take on this is
like I don't think it's care a little
less. I think it's like imagine what
could go right and uh and but I do agree
with you. There's something like being
really deeply attached to stuff
that's I I remember this thread and
those of you who know me know that it's
not that I don't care that that is it's
more of a t it's more of a
tongue-in-cheek phrase and I'll explain
it but to your first point 100% on kind
of the shift in in this industry and I
think I think it's
more you know tabula roasa for lack of a
better phrase than it's ever been
because like even when I was growing up
in HR you 25 years ago you learn from
the ones that did before and this is how
we do it or like this company does it
this way and this is these are how the
all the companies do it and you kind of
have this thing that is like no longer
the case and I think that's been turning
for a few years it doesn't just happen
overnight you know what I mean but I
think it has been happening over the
past I would say three five years and
the folks that are making that turn are
grabbing it and you see a lot of folks
that are kind of not doing the role
anymore or having a hard time adjusting,
but the freshness of what's going on and
and things being defined, not because
they've done it in the past. Yeah,
that's a big one. And like we we just
talked about this a couple episodes ago,
right? Bending rules. Yeah. Right.
Experimenting, trying new stuff, best
practice is a word that's no longer used
really. I mean, it's all
shifting. And I do think it's going to
create people leaders that aren't
historical like HR people as a result,
which you're seeing as well. Me too. Hey
everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our
sponsors. Your workforce is your
organization's greatest strength and
often its largest single expense. But
without the right tools, understanding

fluctuations, forecast with confidence,

more. I must admit, I used to believe
that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR. That is until my
friend Heather Doce, who leads talented
signal fire, told me to check out
Metaview. I got into the product and was
like, "Wow, AI actually does exist in
recruiting." And this product is sick.
Metave is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for
recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. Metaview covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like
Brex, HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metave. Head over to
metav.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metabuse's product experts. Tell them
that and Kelly sent you. Or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in minutes.
Okay. And on the care a little less, we
talked about this too and I think I just
want to clarify my point um because I
fell into this early on. When people
leaders grab the wheel so tight on
everything that's thrown at them and
stress about it and think about it and
try to fix it
and you know try to just hit every ball
that's hit at them. I do believe it
causes burnout. I believe it it makes us
more ineffective. And I just my point is
I think those of us who lasted a long
time in this role, sometimes you just
got to be like, "Look, you're a
ding-dong. You're not going to get it.
I'm not going to sit here till my face
turns blue and I miss my family dinner
going around the circle with you." Like
sometimes if you have to figure out when
to let things go, I guess is my bigger
point, Nolan. And yeah, how to spend
your calories more wisely. maybe
compartmentalize a little bit. Um, and
it's not just business and HR, right? We
see this with par my brother's a
paramedic like you have to figure out
how to do that I think across the board
or else you don't survive.
It's so well said and it's something
that I'm slowly talking right now
because I'm still processing for myself
as one of those things that like I'm
personally working on. Yeah. Like I just
talked to a client this morning. They
were so spun up. Yeah. And and literally
like I could feel the anxiety and all
the things coming through the screen on
something where I was like, "Look, this
probably isn't one of those things. And
because you're doing this, you're
burning yourself out. You're spinning
your wheels. You're probably spending
political capital that you're wasting
totally. And you're not spending it over
here, which is where it really matters."
And I made the mistakes, too. But it's a
marathon, not a sprint, I guess, is what
I'm saying. And sometimes you got to
care a little less when it makes sense
and know when you can't. Yeah. The last
big thread was like finding peers
outside of your company that you can
lean on, right? And so it was really
interesting because like what what I
always get from this event specifically
is like you're actually getting like
real conversation and people
workshopping ideas. Yeah. And I think a
lot of other conferences are very
performative. So it's like, "Oh, we have
like everything figured out." And it's
like so full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like of course you
don't. Yeah. Of course you don't. Like
it's like it's like immediately when you
hear people just like preaching gospel,
you're like just stop. Yeah. But at the
happy hour you're like, "Okay, give me
the real deal. Come on. What's wrong
with you?" Totally. But there's an
interesting aspect to what you just
said, which I think there's this deep
yearning in our community to actually
have real community. Like you and
Colleen are on this text thread and it's
like shit'll go on like we'll ping in
the thread and then we'll actually
workshop ideas with each other. And I
would just say that whether it's through
a coach, a mentor, a small group, you
got to figure it out. But if you are in
one of these jobs, and it's not just for
HR or talent leaders, this is for
everybody. Like, you got to have people
outside of your company who can provide
other perspectives and to challenge your
thinking so that you're not doing what
Kelly was just talking about, which is
like spending political capital on
things that are very low
ROI. And it whether it's just to
workshop ideas, whether it's to get
perspective, we all need other people.
And I actually think you need other
people outside of the company. And I
think this was a big thread there is
like a realization for me. I had some of
this when I was operating. I didn't have
enough of it. And I wish I had more. And
I think that was the take from everyone
else too. Yeah. Yeah. And I think one of
my last comments was, you know, we
talked about what what does this role
do? What what is this job? And and I
just said, "Look, a a good a big litmus
test for me is the percentage of time
you're
spending lifting tactical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
checking boxes and spinning wheels
versus higher order, architecting,
orchestrating, influencing,
evangelizing, communicating. So I'm
always like, if I'm spending more than
half my time doing stuff and spinning
wheels and pushing paper, no one cares."
Like that's honestly like that's the
that's the stuff we have to do. But in
but but it doesn't matter as much as you
spending the most of majority of your
time as a people leader architecting,
orchestrating, assembling,
communicating, influencing, but you
can't do that stuff unless you have the
right team and the right setup to do
that tactical stuff, right? It's it's
it's necessary but not sufficient. And
that was a big kind of thread we talked
about as well together. Yep. So, shout
out to our home EP for another great
event. Um, and I hope you find your
tribe. And if you need help, reach out
to me and Kelly. We'd love to help you
guys. Thanks all. See y HR Heretics is a
