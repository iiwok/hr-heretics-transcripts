All right. Hello everybody. Welcome to
another session of HR Heretics. Hope you
all are doing great. We have rescheduled
this probably four times mostly because
of not you Baz but us. And I'm so
excited to have you on. So, so Cynthia
Baslmit, Shrunner. I didn't know what
name to call her because we have Bas
Lameit. Baz, we have Shoner Shron. So,
I'm just going to stick with the OG Baz.
Now, this person I I have looked up to
since I was like a baby. I was like a
toddler wearing diapers at into it at 20
years old being like, "Oh my god, I want
to go to Facebook with that." And like
this person is so wellknown, has done so
much stuff and has seen it all. Like
great stuff, total disasters and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
shows. But the best part, she wants to
talk about it all. And it's just like
just like we do on this show, Nolan. We
got nothing to lose. It's real talk.
It's real stories. And we're going to
pull it out of you. We're so excited to
have you. I'm excited to be here. I
think everything is fair game because
the only way you can make things better
is share the things you screwed up and
share the things you got right. That
that's what I kind of do. So, I'm I'm
very excited to be here with the two of
you because I've listened to your
podcast and I'm excited to be a guest.
So, thank you. We're so stoked to have
you on. So, I want to start with the
story you shared last week on LinkedIn.
So, first of all, you were at Meta for
 
people at Electric Capital, but you
shared a story at Meta about being
demoted. And you know, I always talk to
my I talk to my friends about this all
the time. I'm like, when you're an exec,
basically like the only way you leave
the building is you get fired. Well, the
other thing that has come up in my
career that I failed to mention is
people do get demoted. Can you share
that story with us? I'd love to share
the story with you. When I started at
Facebook, it was about 300 people and we
it was incredible growth. It was 2008.
We kept adding people and incumbents who
were ready in place were the ones who
were getting the bigger jobs and hiring
people under them. And so, fast forward
a couple years and I had this large team
and it was something I never thought I'd
have. And I was loving I was loving the
team aspect of it. I hated the job. I
hated running meetings and setting
agendas and having to do PC things with
other teams and I really just loved the
client work and I had to go to my boss
all the time, head of HR. She loved me
because I had helped her for years and
years. She was a marketer turned head of
recruiting turned head of HR and she was
needed help and I was always there for
her so she had my back. She she grew up
under
Cheryl's sort of reign of you help them,
you help them fake it till they make it.
Cheryl was always pretty supportive of
people that way. Lori did the same for
me. And Lory's like, you are not going
to fail. Just shut up and stop being a
wuss. And I'd go to her at least once a
month. And I was like, Lori, I love
these parts. Cuz we'd always make
clients do love loathe exercises. What
do you love and you get your energy
from? And what do you loathe and you
hate? And I loathed so much my job. I
was like, Lori, here's my list. I hate
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm really bad at it. She's
like, "You're not bad at it. You could
be better, but don't worry, you're
great." And we did this dance for about
two years. And by then, I was I was
director and I had all the scope. And I
was so well known in the company because
I'm a good HRBP and I'm good at building
the
relationships, but I just didn't love
the rest of it. And I and I was working
 
So, finally one day I go talk to Lori
and I was like, "Here's what we're going
to do and here's my plan." in. And she's
like, "Well, Baz, you know, we've been
talking for 2 years now about you hating
your job." And I was like, "Yeah, so."
And she's like, "Well, I think it's now
time. I think it's now time to bring
someone in over you." And I was like,
"Are you firing me?" And she's like,
"No, no, no. There's tons of growth
here. There's tons of opportunity. We've
got a bunch of other wrecks open. You
could do what you love to do, which is
run tech. You love running tech. You
don't love the business side or the
sales side." And I sat there and I was
shocked and I was like, "Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't cry." cuz like my heart
was like, you know, crying and my brain
was like, "Hell yeah, hell yeah,
finally." And they were not reconciling
and I was like, "Okay, I'm going to walk
away for a hot minute." And I went I
cried and I had taken the shuttle in so
I couldn't even cry in my car. I had to
like go cry in a conference room. I
think I was in one of the breastfeeding
rooms. It was so embarrassing. And I
cried and called my husband. I ended up
just Ubering home. He was my boyfriend
at the time. I called him and I was
telling him what happened. He goes,
"You've been wanting this, you dumbass."
And I was like, "No, no, no. I've been
wanting this in my head, but my heart
never caught up with my head." So, I
wasn't there yet. And I was like,
"Okay." I came back, I think a couple
days later, cuz I called in sick. I was
like, "I would just be sick for a couple
days. Feel sorry for myself." I came
back and I said, "Let's do the search.
This is the right thing. It's going to
take me a while to get used to." Told my
team about it. And they were wicked out
by me. They're like, "Why are you doing
this?" And yeah, well because they my
team liked me and the fear of bringing
in a new leader. What was what worked
great at Facebook was grooming people
internally because you opt into the
culture. You understand what works and
what doesn't. So there was a little
fear, but there was also a little
excitement. I could see some people on
my team were like, "Baz hates doing the
pass downs. Baz hates doing the
planning. Baz hates doing the the
two-year planning and strategy work."
And my team loves that. My team needed
and frankly they needed it. It's not
just that they loved it. They needed it
to do their jobs because I didn't like
it. I would always kick that that can
down the road. And so we started the
search and we looked and we looked and
we looked and the minute and I hated all
the people we saw. I'm like, "Fuck hard,
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] her wal." And then
we meet this one woman and I come out of
the room and I look at Lori, my boss,
and Lori's like, "What do you think?" I
go, "I'm not going to say anything till
you meet her." Lori comes out and we
just high five and we jump up and down
like she's the person. And so then I I
got her set up and I brought her in and
everyone met her. She was way better
than me at all the parts of the job I
sucked at. And it was like a weight was
lifted. It was still embarrassing for a
while. It was it was embarrassing.
People that I used to manage, people
that I used to d they were now my peers.
That part didn't bother me because I
hired stars. So I knew that they were
going to be my peers. That that part
didn't bother me. But it I love being
the decision maker. I love being the
shot caller. And now I was an input. And
so that took some getting used to. And
then I loved it. And then I was just
like, it felt so freeing to focus and go
deep and do great work in one area. It
took a couple months. But I knew it was
the right thing. But when Lori dropped
the hammer on me, I was like, for two
years you said I could fake it till I
make it. And we let other people fake it
till they make it all the time. Like
here's five other people who aren't
being successful in their role. Why me?
And she's like, "Because it's time and
we now need it." And yeah, it was I
ended up figuring out what the trigger
was for her finally. She never told me
what finally turned her cuz it wasn't
Cheryl. Cheryl wanted me to stay in the
job. It was another executive who
pointed it out to her. And he was a
smart guy. I didn't like him. Wasn't a
fan. And then when I found out it was
him, I really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated him. And if
I ever if he was ever on fire in the
street, I wouldn't not even pee on him.
I'd be like, "Burn, bitch." But it was
finally someone internally who had a ton
of credibility who's like she's great
but she's hurting the growth of the
function and the whole function elevated
with Janelle coming in really did so and
it helped me realize what I love to do
and I just loved going deep in a client
group and spending at least 70% of my
time with clients then I could manage
people then I can coach individuals and
make teams better and all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but
if I didn't have 70% client work isn't
it so good to know like what
you want to do. I mean, you said the
loathe love thing, but and and just
being clear about what what you like
doing and actually being free to say it,
right? Because a lot of us, I don't know
about you both, but we go through our
career, we're like, "Well, everything's
the job." And and no one really says,
"Well, you know what?" And I'll speak
for myself, I don't like doing L &amp; D
stuff. I do not like training. I do not
like facilitating large classrooms. like
and I yet I did it for so long because
you you felt like you couldn't say you
don't want to do it and I and I just
want to say this I think now it is
totally not taboo to do that but you did
it back when you know you didn't really
do that and you know this this is a real
story it wasn't on our agenda we don't
really have an agenda but I interviewed
to go work with Baz and the team at
Facebook I can't say meta I just I can't
say it. I don't know. I can't say it.
And I remember, you tell me if I'm
wrong, but paraphrasing, I was young,
you know, I was rocking and rolling. I
think it was 2011 or 2012. And, you
know, it was really positive and yet it
wasn't quite the right thing. And some
of the feedback came back and it was
like well you kind of have a reputation
for like too much of the client or too
much of the I don't know I'm
paraphrasing but may maybe
entrepreneurial spirit or breaking role
and I'm like yeah that's what I like to
do and I found my niche and venture
where you get thrown out of the building
unless you are like that and I realize
now I probably wouldn't have been happy
there or would have done as well. So,
it's so interesting. And yet, I I
remember I cried in like a hallway in a
bathroom. I was like, they don't like
me. It's like, no, these are classic
classic ego stories, right? Like that's
what we're describing right now is I was
in there, Janelle, and all of it. Yeah.
I mean, so my my version of this was at
Door Dash and I was working with Brett
Record, who was the head of talent at
Sequoia at the time, and Brett said
something to me as kind of like a big
foreshadow in my career. He said,
"Nolan, there's there's early stage
people and there's late people. You got
to figure out which one you are." And I
was like, "The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like, you're not
going to put me in a box, dude. Like, I
can be any of this stuff." And it turns
out like once, you know, it's like the
same thing with people managers. My joke
on people management is everybody wants
to manage people until they do and then
they're like, "Oh my god, there's all
this other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] outside of like, yeah,
my paycheck's a little bit bigger."
Because like our ego is driving us to
have a bigger title, a bigger paycheck,
more notoriety, more followers on
LinkedIn. when like once you actually
get kind of comfortable with yourself,
you can be honest about the things that
you don't like and then figure out like
how to solve for those
things. Hey everyone, we'll be right

that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR. That is until my
friend Heather Dose, who leads talent at
SignalFire, told me to check out Metave.
I got into the product and was like,
"Wow, AI actually does exist in
recruiting." And this product is sick.
Metiv is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for
recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metaview changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate and every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. Metivview covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metav. Head over to
metave.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metabuse's product experts. Tell them
that me and Kelly sent you. Or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in minutes.
So, like, how did you go through that
ego exercise, Baz? Because that that
thing is still hard, I think, for most
people. It got easier because I actually
demoted myself a second time a couple
years later when I hired when I hired
Christine Ellis. I'll tell you that
story in a minute because that's
hilarious because Christine was she's
money for me. There was a cost to the
time like my mental health was taking a
toll. And my parents my parents were
immigrants to the US. They came my dad
when he was six and then my mom when she
was 15. And every time they would see me
for us, families, like family's first.
And they're like, "What is wrong with
you? You know, you have no children."
And I was like, "Well, first I need a
man to have kids. I ain't got nothing
going on, mom." Like, and they were
yelling at me all the time like, "All
you do is work. You look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And
how come you haven't brought us grandb
babies?" And I was like, "Just shut up.
There's more to life than getting
married and having kids." But I also
realized I also wanted those things. And
what was happening was I was working
seven days a week and I was only getting
jobs. I was get all my satisfaction in
life was coming through work, neglecting
friendships, neglecting families. It was
just kind of lonely and when when this
started happening like because at
Facebook we really did support the lean
into your strengths and do what you
love. So I had practic and I hate L &amp; D
stuff. I think most L &amp; D trainings are
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] garbage with the exception of a
few like situational leadership's good,
crucial conversations, but I actually
kind of like strengthfinder too because
I was like I'm an action person. And I'm
not like always the most strategic and I
love doing the work to solve the
problems. And the more I kept doing that
stuff, I was like what my job needs is
more of what I don't have. Like I can't
I'm not one of those per people who
could look out two years from now and be
like these 17 things are going to
happen. I could look out six months and
do it. Janelle was the person who could
look out the two years and that's what
the firm needed because we were going
hyperrowth. So part of it was and I know
it sounds cheesy. I didn't want to let
the team down. I don't want to let the
company down. I loved Facebook. I was
sucking that Kool-Aid through that straw
all day. So to me it was like company
first, team first, me second. And I
still knew there was opportunity for me.
My first couple years there, there were
a lot of people getting layered. And I
had had the conversation with them over
and over. There's still a ton of growth.
There's still an opportunity. Just cuz
it's not this job doesn't mean it's not
this one. And I I believed it. So when I
was saying that stuff to people, I
wasn't I wasn't lying to them. I didn't
feel like I was I actually believed it.
We're growing. We averaged like 30%
growth year-over-year the first 10 years
I was there. So there's plenty of
opportunity. And so I think what got me
there was maybe I can find the job that
actually makes me happy and I guess
still get to work here. And that's what
happened. So when it happened the first
time and it worked out so well, tech
then started ballooning and getting
super big. And I was like and it started
turning into that Janelle role. I was
like, "Shit, it's happening again and I
can't do that and I've now already been
here this long. I'm going to quit unless
I can rescope a little more and get a
little more focused." So, I hired
Christine Ellis and I told her this is
the job that she declined me the first
time. She said no. And I was like, "What
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm offering you this
beautiful job to run all of tech and I
would be one of your employees. I'm
amazing. People would die to have me
work for them. Are you like I'm amazing.
what's your problem? And the team's
great cuz I hired them. Like, I'm
handing you the golden goose. She said
no to me. I was pissed. And I had just
had my second kid at this point. And I
remember I was sitting with my kid at
home on Matt leave and I was like, "No,
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] her." So, I called her back and I
was like, "You said no to me and you're
coming because you're going to be my
person now and we're going to make this
happen." And she's like, "Okay, I'll
come." And she ended up turns out J.
that the guy who also ran in for also
called her and sort of like browbe her a
little bit. She came and the goal was
she reports to me for about a year and
then we would flip and every month I was
like are you ready? Are you ready? I
want cuz now that I had tasted it the
first time and saw how much happier I
was and job satisfaction and still
growth and opportunity. I was just a
greedy greedy person. And I wanted to
have that cake and I wanted to lick it
and eat it and eat it twice and I was
just and so because it worked out so
well the first time. I did it again a
couple years later and still worked out
great. I still ended up hitting my D2
and hit VP and had great scope and great
impact. But now I was part of this
wonderful team of people where it was
just because of Christine Ellis. Like
she built this wellrusted team of people
and it worked great. But once I tasted
it had to have it again. I wasn't going
to not have it again. So, what were the
commonalities of the person that came in
to ultimately like win your trust and
the team's trust? Because that's that
tends to be like a big blocker. So, when
you talk to the
stereotypical early stage person who
doesn't like who can't scale to like the
latestage person, then we have to like
start interviewing. That person gets on
the interview panel and almost every
case that person's like, "Nope, nobody's
good enough." Right? it's like
impossible to like satisfy them. So,
what was true of those interviews and
those experiences and then you reporting
to those people that ultimately made it
successful? I would say something that's
very consistent with both of them is
they're both data and we had to be data
and it's data doesn't come naturally for
I could barely spell data but they were
both data. So, we had to take those
learnings to make things better. They
were also both and I'm doing their
technical skills first and then I'll go
to the heart of what you're saying but
they were also systems level thinkers.
They were both the people who could sit
there and be like this is what's going
to happen in two years because they
could see the data and they could see
this
thing which were both very opposite of
what my strengths were. So those two
things were true but then they want
feedback from people. They want they
knew that the best solutions we could
create were all bottoms up and top down.
So they took a they
weren't command and control leaders.
They didn't be like we could see this
two years out now everyone do it. It was
like here's what we're thinking. What's
your guys' input? What are we missing?
What are the gaps? So we built things
very
collaboratively. High level of trust,
high level of integrity. And I mean,
Kelly, you you know, Christine, like
she's her caliber and just Christine
especially leads with actually Janelle
leads with kindness, too. But Christine
leads with a high level of integrity.
She really cares about people, but she's
still going to give you the
feedback. And there was a high level of
care for the HR team and building a
really, really strong HR community.
Christine was very much you couldn't get
anything done at Meta or Facebook unless
you can work cross team collaboratively.
That was the bread and butter. Both of
them were about bringing people
together. It I mean you can easily get
cutthroat and caddyy like at Yahoo and I
was at Yahoo I was like that team sucks
and that team's poo poo and here it was
like how do we uplift the whole how do
we make them better? If they do suck how
can we help make them better enough so
that we didn't have to like if they were
really bad obviously we would take
corrective action but if they were good
and they were just lacking context why
wouldn't we want to help them? So, there
was this we're in it together. We're one
team. And it sounds cheesy. Christine
Ellis gave a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about people's
opinions. If she thought they were
wrong, she would tell them they were
wrong. So, high level of honesty and
integrity. But I knew that every time I
hired someone like that, I was making
the team better. Also, by bringing in a
different skill set because what I will
say is what they were great at, I
wasn't. What I was great at, they were
not. If you were gonna throw someone in
front of a client, you're gonna throw me
in front of the client because I can
speak the language and I had the
credibility there. But I couldn't figure
out what HR needed to build for two
years out. And it bugged me because for
a while I was like, I'm going to learn
it. I'm going to learn to be just like
them so I could be
well-rounded. Nope. I couldn't. And I
mean, even if I could, which I bet you I
could have done like 50 to 70% of it, it
just drained me and it took too much
energy and I just it just didn't feed my
soul. And I already had all this I was
greedy. I had all this stuff that
already fed my soul and they were
offering it to me. Why would I spend my
time on this other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I that
didn't feed me when I could just be
greedy and do the stuff that I love to
do and I'm so great at and have a lot of
impact in? I'm gonna just say something
very directly because if I'm listening
to this, you know, I could say, "Well,
this is great. I can just fire myself
and demote myself and pick my job and do
things I only love to do and great. The
world's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome." The real talk
about that is is not everyone has the
right to do that. And I think I just
would love your your both your your
reactions on that because I I I don't
think you can actually do that unless
you have performed immensely well,
unless you are trusted and respected in
an organization, unless you've made such
great impact that people would do
anything but let you leave. And I think
that that can be missed and kind of
maybe overlooked when it's just like,
yeah, I'm going to do this and I'm going
to pick my stuff. That it's not that
easy. You make it sound very you never
see it. You're totally right, Kelly.
Like you ne you never see it for those
reasons. Plus internally, you know,
there's this there's this back channel
conversation that's happening behind
your
back. And when you've been there, you
know exactly what I'm talking about. And
it sucks, but you know what's going on.
You know people are chirping about you.
And so that makes you feel like they
don't love me anymore. And sometimes
like maybe they don't sometimes like
those conversations just aren't nuanced
because oftentimes when you're in these
companies you're dealing with immature
leaders and that's why you have to be
very sure if you're someone that's going
to do this like I did it at Pendo and I
went through the same thing. I took
myself out of the job. It was an icy and
very clear but I still had some heart
and head reconciliation after it becomes
real. You're like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so much has
happened. And it's funny because even
though you're you did great, you're well
respected, I could still tell like some
people's questions. Hey, what happened?
Did
you you know what I mean? So, and it
doesn't matter what people think, but
but it matters that you have to be very
clear and confident around that because
people will always think that you got
fired or you got like that did hurt my
feeling. I want to answer Nolan your
question first, then I'm going to go
Kelly to your question. Nola, to your
question, I think I I I'll say part of
it was part of it was I I did perform
well and and and that's why they did it,
but it was also because Meta was growing
at 30% a year. Most companies aren't
growing at a 30% a year clip. So, we had
the luxury of doing stuff like that. And
we had done it so many times with so
many people that when it happened to me,
I was like, I've talked people through
this and now it's happening to me. I got
to talk myself through it. And I did
three days off, three days of crying
later. But that's why I was lucky
because the company was going fast
growth. But I did have a good reputation
and that's why they wanted to be able to
keep both. But what I will say is ever
since I did that post, I've got a lot of
inbound on LinkedIn. Just people telling
me, "Hey, I'm struggling with this as
well. What do you think?" Sometimes you
can't do it at your own company.
Sometimes you have to go to a new
company do it, which is scary if your
company doesn't allow you to do that.
for for me. I know people were talking
about me. I used to be in meetings I
didn't get to go to anymore. Now Janelle
was in those meetings and that bummed me
out because I knew I could still add a
lot of value there cuz I had the
relationships. So it wasn't that I woke
up 3 months later and I was happy. I was
still jelly monster so many times where
I'd be like I would have nailed that
conversation. And sometimes they would
still invite me in as a guest and I was
like a guest.
Yes, the guest invites are the best. I
was, you know, some of those things just
devastate you when you get kicked out of
the meetings when you're like, I was
good enough last week and I'm not. And
for a while, I still had to prop up
those leaders to make them successful.
And I did it because I wanted them to be
successful because I didn't want to go
back to that job. But the ego hurt for
it. It hurt less the second time when I
hired Christine because I was like, now
that I've tasted it, I'm happy. But the
first time I was like, I don't get to go
to those meetings. I don't get to attend
Lori Gler's executive staff meeting
anymore because I'm not a direct report
anymore. I've now been layered and
regulated to this
group. It wasn't easy and people did
talk. People were like, Baz, what's
going on? And then they would meet
Janelle and kind of figure it out. I was
like, I'm not good. So then I just
started talking about it. It was kind of
healing for me to tell people the story
internally. So when people would bring
it up, I'd be like, well, here's where I
wasn't doing a good job. Here's where I
think I was doing a really great job.
and this is what the company needed. I
couldn't get us there and or or if I did
it would have been too late and that's
not what the company needs. Like my job
was coaching leaders on building healthy
orgs. So if I was the hypocrite in the
way of stopping people at from building
their healthy HRBP org, then what kind
of leader am I? Right? And so yeah, my
husband's like, "Oh, you're such a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idealist drinking the Kool-Aid."
Yeah, I am a bit of an ideal. But at
Facebook, I did feel like I drank the
Kool-Aid. I love that. I loved it. So I
didn't love it, but I really was aligned
with what the company was doing and what
we were trying to do. And I worked with
people who had such a great true north.
There were very few [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] really on
at Facebook. So everyone you worked with
was just trying to do goodness. And it
infects you. Like it infects you. So you
want to do that.
And yeah, it hurt. The ego hurt a really
really I have a big ego. I'm not going
to leave my ego at the door. Look at me.
I got big hair. I got big ego. got to
take it with me everywhere I go. And so,
but then I realized the cost of my ego
wasn't worth the cost of my happiness. I
I got a lot happier after that. It just
felt better. That's it's just like a
case study in self-awareness. And what's
really what's really interesting is by
explaining to other people who are
asking you about it, you're kind of like
reaffirming it in your head, you know?
you're like it's like re-explaining to
you and you're like yeah like I believe
myself on this right cuz your ego is
always chirping at you with my son we
have this thing we call it like like
good Kevin and bad Kevin like on each of
his shoulders and I'm like dude like
this is all within us like these voices
compete within our heads and it just
takes such a level of maturity I mean
Kelly how we've been doing this for two
years this is like the best story I've
ever heard like this is such a dope
story it's it's it's really good because
this is the truth of how it works. You
know, we we spend our time a lot. We
talk I mean, come on, real talk. We talk
about all the tech stuff and the echo
chamber and all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And the truth
is there's there's a lot outside of all
that that also matters. And a lot of
people I coach, we talk about you forget
about those things until you reach a
certain level of maturity or age or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
happens in life. You know what I mean?
and and then other things become more
important and I I think like the Jerry
Magcguire Quan like is having both in a
balanced manner that is the best and a
lot of people they they never get there
because they're so ego or they don't
realize that there's other things or
they're so wrapped it's very easy like
you said your mom back you're working
all the time it's so easy to do that you
know we've all been there but I I think
The trick of this whole thing is to love
tech and also love other things and try
to balance them together. I don't think
you can do that without relationships,
trust, credibility, and actually
executing well in your role. And to not
play the comparison game. It's so easy
to look and be like, well, you know,
Johnny over there is, you know, VP of
HR. Like I feel like I'm smarter than
John, but like he's got other things
going on in his life and he cares about
other things. And that's why the old
saying comparison is the thief of joy I
think is so true. Like your mother
holding up that mirror to you, right?
And like cuz like it really like our
parents know, right? Like my parents
like you know see within my soul on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and they say things to me I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
I like no I don't want to hear that. And
in fact like sometimes you need to hear
it. And that's where like family and
friends are the most important things
because they actually know your
authentic self and they can call your
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and make sure that like you are
following your true north and that's
what your mom did. What a sick story.
And if you can get that in a tech
company, if you can get if you can get
as much as that, it's awesome. I've had
it a few times and it's the best thing.
It felt so good. The comment you just
made about
comparison, it it kept happening to me
even after I got demoted. Like I would
keep doing that. Well, I'm better than
that person. What? And then I'd have to
like check myself. So, it wasn't like a
joyous journey once the demotion
happened. It wasn't like life's all
peaches and unicorns now. I'd still see
people get promoted. I'm like that
person's a dumbass. Talk about fake it
till you make it and they still haven't
made it and you still promoted them. So,
stuff like that would happen. those
inequities that still would eat away at
me. And so it didn't just go away
because I my ego didn't miraculously go
away because I still have a I still now
I don't even at the firm anymore and I
still know how awesome I am. So that
part didn't go away. But that comparison
killed people internally. I'd have
engineers come to me who they had their
partner and they had their life and they
had their community and they would come
to me and be like, "Baz, I started the
same time that person did. How come he's
a director now? How come she's a VP now?
And I was like, but you're doing great
at your job and you're super happy.
Well, yeah, but look at them. They're
making more money than me and they've
got the bigger title and they're sitting
at the Mark meetings, Cheryl meetings,
and I'm not. And I was like, well, if
you want that, we can create that path
for you. First, you got to figure out if
you really want if you want that. 80% of
the time they didn't want it. 20% they
did. 20% of the time they did. They did
want a little more. the 80 time percent
of the time that they didn't. The only
reason they thought they should is
because they were doing the comparison
thing and it's so dangerous to do that
because it does that saying you just
said is money. It does kill your joy. It
really does. It does. It it's it's it's
a straight thief because you're just
you're just on the path, right? And all
you can see are the other people getting
the things, but you don't you know,
Kelly and I talked about this a couple
weeks ago. It's like you don't actually
know what's going on behind the scenes.
Your point was like working seven days a
week. Some people are wired for that
thing, right? Like I'm not I got to that
realization a couple years ago. I'm not
I'm not wired for that thing anymore. I
actually think my story that I tell
myself now I've aged out of it. Like and
I think that happens to a lot of people
too. But it's just, you know, and this
is, I think, the real work of HRBP and I
think we actually, Kelly, I think this
is like the real meat of like where this
role is super valuable inside of
organizations is when you can illuminate
things to people that they're not
thinking of. Yes. It's it's all I do now
is try to connect what they're doing
every day at this company with like joy
in their lives. Because when those
things are like when those things are
separate and for me they've been
separate before it gets real
uncomfortable and it's not sustainable
and that the optics of those comparisons
like you're exactly right like you don't
know what's happening. I mean the irony
of all this is like I know a lot of
people that deleted Facebook because
they were getting mentally screwed up
looking at people's lovely lives on that
product and feeling bad. Yeah. And to
your point, if the joy is connected to
the work, then it's not work. I keep
telling my kids, my kids are like,
"Mommy, one day we're going to work at
Facebook like you or Google like dad." I
said, "Or you're going to find a job or
a profession that feeds your soul. When
so when you wake up every day, it
doesn't feel like work. It feels like
and you know, some days it's still going
to suck, but you enjoy it." And and my
son's like, "Great, professional video
gamer." I'm like, "Shut up." But the
point is, I I think it is hard. Like
social media will mess with your head
and then hyperrowth companies will mess
and it doesn't mean don't go work at a
hyperrowth company. You'll find lots of
interesting learnings and things that
you could do but that comparison game is
dangerous and you really do need friends
and family and community. I I I I read
this I rent got this book from the
library recently called Designing Your
Life. And it's really like a bunch of
designers who design product and then
they say apply it to your life and
here's all the elements. You have to
decide how big or little you want them.
And I was like oh this is fun. I've
never actually taken the time to think
about how I want to spend my time like
in a purposeful way. And I was like I'm
 
thought how do I spend my time in a
personal in a in a purposeful way. And
it's really helping me rethink how I
want to spend my time. And I only work
part-time. I only work at electric three
days a week. So, I'm really being
purposeful about those other four days a
week and what I do. So, it's been it's
been interesting. Man, that's such a
it's such a great story. Thank you for
sharing with us. I I do want to talk
about you know, you you left me what
 
right? And let's actually go back to
like kind of like COVID and ramping.
So Meta hired like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. Like
the joke that I used to say was like,
you know, tech was drunk on hiring.
Well, and then, you know, 2021, 2022 hit
and then all of a sudden, like, you
know, it's like you're at the club and
they flip the lights on at four o'clock
in the morning. You're like, "Oh my god,
like what is going on here?" And then
you guys had to get sober really quick,
right? And that looked like layoffs and
a lot of layoffs and it looked like a
lot of shit-talking in the community
about your strategy, right? Because it
was like, oh, like they don't care about
people. They're just hiring and firing.
Like Mark doesn't care about people. You
were there. What actually happened? Like
what's the internal narrative? We were
sloppy. Okay. So COVID hit and Mark's
like, "Now more than ever, our tools
have to help connect the world." So the
first couple months of co from a work
perspective, not a life perspective,
from a work perspective were amazing. We
were working longer hours. We were
trying to bootstrap teams that would
help MPA stores around the world come
online because they usually just had
presence a presence in a physical store
in a storefront. So like if you're like
some small store in Italy which was
getting decimated by co we're like we're
going to get them online. So we set up
all these free tools and this free
software and like free ads credits to
get them online and that was Mark's and
we were all like so motivated and so
excited. He's like that means more
resources. So that product that team
went from like 500 people to like 5,000
people in I don't know a year and but we
just kept iterating and couldn't find
product market fit. And then Mark's
like, "Well, we need this for ads, so
ads can boost more revenue." And
WhatsApp, you need you only have 500
engineers. You should have a thousand,
so you could do 10 projects at once
instead of two. And that wasn't
WhatsApp's way of doing things. And that
wasn't Instagram's way of doing things.
They did things in a more curated way.
Whereas Mark would keep saying, "Hey
Nolan, if I give you 5,000 more
headcount, what other things can you
do?" Kelly, if you're leading Messenger
and I gave you 2,000 more, what could
you do? So the exercises were always
give me a 20% plan, give me a 40% plan,
what could those look like? And if you
promised you could do all these things,
you would get the headcount. It was like
an arms race. It was really, it was
crazy. And all of us on our side,
especially on the recruiting side, this
one leader in recruiting was like, we're
doing too much because what we started
to see on the HRBP side was too many
redundancies, too many of the same teams
popping up in different orgs. And we're
like, why do we need this team here when
we have it here? But no one was talking
anymore. We were getting too big and
people were just really focused on
achieving these mark goals. They weren't
doing it in my opinion to screw with the
other teams. They weren't sitting there
saying this team sucks so we're going to
bootstrap our own. That happened in
small increments but it was more we
think we can get there faster and really
help our product grow. And
then co was over. During co everyone
used Facebook. Our numbers shot up.
WhatsApp usage shot up, Instagram
because everyone was stuck at home.
They're just doom scrolling, texting,
connecting, and then COVID was over.
People left their homes. Usage skyrock
or shot down. No one was using it
anymore because they're like, I can go
outside. I can talk to people. I don't
want to be trapped, you know, to this
tethered to this, you know, doom
scrolling tool anymore. And so then our
usage went down, our ad revenue went
down, coupled with Apple saying, "You
don't get to do ad targeting anymore and
that was screwing with our ads." And so
Mark and I would say there was another
influence, which is Mark and a bunch of
these CEOs from different companies,
they all chat on WhatsApp together and
they like share a bunch of best
practices and stuff. And whenever they
would hire, like you would see us hire,
if we were hiring, then they'd start
hiring. Everyone was a fast follower and
then some people were saying let's just
start tightening our belts a little bit.
So Mark was like okay let's tighten our
belts a little bit. I'm not saying he
was a fast follower but they all sort of
agreed with each other. It was really
weird the sort of group think you would
see across some of these teams. And I
don't even know who the CEOs were. I
have an idea but I don't know exactly
who they
were. And then our numbers just weren't
doing well. And we have been saying for
a while we've got a fat middle. like we
were too many layers, too many managers.
So Mark sat down and he said, "Let's
find efficiencies." So he set the CTO
up, shre at the time, to be like, "Go
find efficiencies that you could make in
the company. Are there edge
efficiencies? Can we code faster? Can we
ship faster? Can we eliminate a bunch of
sloppy code?" So then everyone started
thinking through efficiencies. And so
they started asking
HRBPS, "What efficiencies do you need?"
And I was like, well, in order to ship
product, you actually don't need these
two huge teams that are a thousand and
 
this, then you actually don't need
these. So, we started having those
conversations and Mark's like, "Okay,
we're going to do a riff. We've got too
many people and we could be tighter and
we need our revenue to be tighter." And
he also, I'll be, you know, took some of
his lead from WhatsApp. WhatsApp was
very few people, very focused, two
billion users. And the the two guys who
founded it, Brian and Yan, were like,
when we bought them, 60 people, 60
people already a billion users. And of
those 60 people, 20 were ops, like
building out the stuff in community.
Only like 30 were engineers. And so Mark
really was influenced a lot by Yan and
Brian's focus, lean teams, high quality
teams, lot not a lot of managers. And
Yan and Brian didn't allow any Facebook
groups. They viewed all that as noise.
Mark started seeing that a lot of the
stuff that we thought was core culture
was now counterculture. It was slowing
us down. We would have, you know, Black
Lives Matters groups and we would talk
about it in town halls and people would
say, "Well, what about blue lives
matter?" And then we'd have to address
that. So all this like death by a
thousand paper cuts of other topics that
weren't ca building product had already
seeped its way into our culture and it
was making work 30% less efficient 40%
less efficient than what we could be and
we were bloated and fat and so we shut
down I want to say like 8,000 wrecks
rescended a couple thousand offers and
then just rifted and let's be clear some
of the rift was needed because there
were redundancy in roles, but also we
were a company that was afraid of, and
I'm just going to say it, they kept
saying like, "We we don't want our Jason
Daymore moment." Google had their Jason
Dmore moment. They're like, "We have to
investigate everything." So, if some
rando came to me and said, "Hey, I'm
being discriminated against." So, I'll
be like, "On what grounds?" I don't
know. I'm just being discriminated by
who? Well, maybe my boss kind of picking
on me. I'm like, "Okay, it sounds like
your boss is giving you feedback." But
if the minute someone said
discriminated, I guess, I'd have to call
the employee relations team and the
investigators would come in and what
should have been a normal like two-month
PIP turned into an investigation and a
year-long process. And and so some of
this was Mark just getting frustrated,
saying, "We're going to just do a
reckoning and just take things out and
just move faster." And so we screwed up.
We hired way too many people because it
was an arms race. He saw other people
doing it. Well, then of course we had to
do it and we didn't need to. We just
started getting inefficient. We started
moving slower and all of our engagement
survey said that. So he would see that
asked people what they should do
differently and that's what sort of led
to it. But he made the call and I don't
disagree with what he did. I think it
was the right thing. I'm just pissed
that we got there in the first place. We
didn't have to get there. We didn't need
Yeah. I mean I I don't know about like
you know the other side to this is is I
think there's a lot of Monday morning
quarterbacking on you know what happened
and it's really easy to like especially
from the outside to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on Facebook
Meta like it's just they're a huge
company and so it's really easy to do
that but if you go back to that time and
god forbid we like try and put ourselves
into Mark's shoes you're seeing like
these numbers go up and you're thinking
your constraint is just more people to
build more products. He had great
intention when he was doing it. Like
Exactly. Like when we worked on that
product, I I just remember they would
meet every morning at 8:00 a.m. and
every night at 7:00 p.m. These teams
would meet and do these and they were
doing it because they wanted to bring
mom and pop businesses online because
they knew CO was killing their business
and starving them. And Mark's like,
"We're going to help them put food on
the table." This and you know, a lot of
people say, "Baz, you drink the
Kool-Aid." I drank it. I believed it.
and the teams who were building those
products believed it. So, we were
bulking up across the shop to make
everything better for people. It's just
then postco everything took a big hit
and then the numbers didn't match up
again or we were getting criticized left
and right. And the thing about Mark is
he usually is the smartest person in the
room. He can see things that other
people can't see. And so, we were
getting too big and it was crazy. And
and I would say the last the year before
the riff were like this is a lot cuz the
recruiting team some of those
recruiters, you know what their like
quarterly goal was? One hire because we
need we had like it's ridiculous. We had
like a 5,000 person recruiting team and
we just needed to throw numbers at it to
hit the plan. But yeah, I I would say it
got You're right. You could Monday
morning quarterback it, but internally
we knew we were getting a little
bloated. The numbers were big.
recruiting couldn't hit the numbers and
they were working their butts off and it
was a great recruiting team to be honest
with you. What does what does Monday
morning quarterbacking mean if I'm a
listener? Like what is that? It it means
you know sitting in the cheap seats to
where you don't actually know what's
going on and criticizing is like Yeah.
With hindsight with with hindsight being
 
And so so so then Baz then then the
other piece of criticism is it wasn't
just one riff. It was like three over
three. You're right. Yeah. Over over a
period of call it like six to nine
months. First one was recruiting and
that was a big one because Mark wanted
to take some of the money and show the
gains. He wanted to take some money off
the table and show the board and people
look we're actually going to do this
once you rift recruiting because then we
had headcount plans for what we thought
we were going to hire. So then we cut
the business and the way we cut the
business was what's priority work,
what's not priority work. And we cut
stuff that really people felt passionate
about like you know the social work and
the the DEI work and the well actually
the DEI was in the third chalk but they
got slashed pretty big as well during
that process. So we cut things that we
thought didn't hurt like I'll give you
I'll give you an example. One of the
things that cut cut is we had a 30
person team just to make the buildings
pretty artists artisan residents who
came in and installed beautiful
installations and they had like this
huge multi-million dollar budget every
year and they came to me and they're
like my budget got cut. I was like
people are losing their jobs. I it's
hard for me to care too much about the
art budget even though these people were
passionate and wonderful like some of
the most crazy interesting people I'd
ever met. So they did that. They thought
that cut, this second cut, which was the
biggest one, would be enough. And that
was October 2023 or October
 
they fast forwarded. And Mark said at
the time, we don't know we're going to
be done. Right now, we're correcting
mainly wrecks. We cut a lot of wrecks.
We shut down like I think 10,000 wrecks,
rescended a couple thousand offers, and
then did our first cut. In that first
cut, we were loathed to call it a
performance cut. Legal was like, you
can't call it a performance cut. And it
wasn't a pure performance cut. There
were multiple factors that fed into it.
Performance was definitely a factor. I'm
like, we could have cut more if we
needed to because from a performance
perspective, we hadn't been keeping the
bar high because we were legally afraid
of our own shadow to be honest with you.
Then when they were doing the final cut,
I was already on my way out and I wasn't
paying as much attention, but I know by
then Mark was like, "We still have too
many layers. We could still get more
efficient." And by then every other
company was doing it and so many
companies were idolizing the way
Facebook did it because Mark actually
wrote a post afterward and he's like,
"We didn't want to do like this was an
er like we screwed up. That's why we had
to do this. These are awesome
employees." Mark did this actually
pretty wonderful post. I got calls from
my friends at LinkedIn and calls from my
friends at Google and calls from my
friends at Amazon. Baz, tell me what you
did it. Tell me what your process was to
do it because we're going to copy it
here. So by then we were getting all
this great press about how nice our how
what a great riff we had. And so I think
Mark felt a little motivated by that and
said we kind of went conservative the
first time because we didn't want to cut
too much. But then we came out at the
other end and we're like, we can
actually afford to go leaner and we
don't need as many managers and we don't
need as, you know, we reduced the number
of managers. We kept senior IC's. That's
really what we wanted, senior IC's. And
we were going to stay away from a lot of
the new college grads and just go with
more seasoned people. And it worked out
well to the point, yeah, I I helped
three other companies. I just walked
them through our process and they're
like, we're going to copy some of this
stuff. And so now that now they're
hiring like crazy. A lot of the
recruiters they laid off, they ended up
rehiring back because now the company's
doing so well. But it's funny now when I
look at how Facebook is operating,
killing all the DEI, killing a lot of
the internal community groups and saying
get back to work. It's very WhatsApp.
It's very not that WhatsApp was mean.
WhatsApp was just focused. And so a lot
of I really do think Mark learned a lot
from some of the other leaders in the
company and was like what actually is
going to work. We need to get back to
brass tax and we need to get back to
just shipping high quality product. So I
I have a feeling they won't do more
layout. I think one of the things I've
always liked about Mark and the
leadership team there because most of
the leaders are still consistently
there. They learn from their mistakes
and they try not to repeat things. And
so I think that was not that it helped
anyone who got laid off, but that was a
lesson learned. I don't really see that
happening again. I I see small things
happening again, small corrections, but
I think they're going to be far more
thoughtful about it now because they
don't need big teams to deliver on the
stuff they're building on. WhatsApp's
proved that over and over again,
especially especially now with like team
dynamics and and AI and stuff like that.
I mean, I really appreciate you sharing
the insights. The the last thing I want
to cover with you is just this this
notion of like you know this the DEI
stuff specifically the two things you
mentioned which I I tend to strongly
agree with which is number one you they
like you like can't fire people
sometimes because you're worried about
retribution and people actually know how
to play the game right like at big
companies like I have friends who work
in big companies and they know if you
say these like couple words it's like
immediately like nope like we get to
draw this out a lot further. And then
the other one is around the resource
groups and and I've always had an
because it's like you can create a
resource group for anything and then if
the resource group like wants you to
focus on something and you guys don't
focus on that thing then all of a sudden
you're like you're some sort of like
working against the resource group which
then can brand you in a negative light.
What's your learning from that era?
Starting with the resource groups f
first. Like resource groups at Facebook
originally started off as fun. A frisbee
group, a knitting group. Like so long as
there were three of you, you guys get a
$1,500 budget a year to go play frisbee.
That's a lot of yarn. Yeah, it's a lot
of yarn. I could I could knit. I could
show you my needle point. And so I love
that because it was about community
building, which was very in line with
what Facebook's mission was. We want to
build community. We want people to be
happy and work with their co-workers.
And then it became more of a mission of
we want to support black communities and
Asian communities and women at
communities. And frankly, those groups
were actually quite helpful. People
found solidarity. They found support.
They found coaching and mentoring. They
became really great de facto mentoring
groups and safety groups. And I was
like, "Oh, you think this? I'm going to
go try that here." And and actually,
they all started off with such great
intent. What ended up happening is I
remember this conversation with this one
woman one time with when George Floyd
was happening and she was she was a very
seasoned leader. She's wonderful and
very active in the black at group. Every
time someone wanted to talk about the
George Floyd, they would ask her and ask
her. She's like, "Baz, I have a day job
yet I'm being asked to spend 30% of my
time every week doing this." And first
of all, it breaks my heart. It's very
draining. and and then I have to educate
people about it and then I have to
answer questions and she goes, "I want
to do it. It's just hard sometimes. I
just want to do work." And what ended up
happening and then we had this one group
who were like, "Well, blue lives matter.
What are you saying? Cops don't matter,
Baz. That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And we can start
our own blue lives group." And then
we're spending all of our time policing
this random 1% of the population instead
of focusing on the 99% who care about
these issues but also just want to come
to work to do great work. and it became
a huge distraction to the population and
they were still very good conversations
that were happening but it wasn't we you
could never really win like the ERGs you
could win because you could give people
support and you could give coaching and
like you know some of our wins with the
ERGs were awesome like we got funding
and we were telling people in this one
group you guys can go get two hours of
coaching from an executive coach every
quarter if you want and it we tied it
back to their performance and it really
helped unlock them. So, when you could
do stuff like that, it's fantastic. But
when it's
causing concern in the company and it's
taking you away from the job and it's
it's it's really interesting
because several groups really leaned. I
had some leaders who are like, "Baz,
I'll post stuff. I'm turning off all
comments because I'm not engaging in
this because we have real work to do."
And other leaders would spend weeks just
engaging in the comments. So for me it's
I I I think DEI plays a very very very
important role in the workplace and for
that to be turned off and I actually
don't think it was fully turned off. I
don't know all the details of what
happened at Facebook as it happened
after I left. To me those initiatives
were really great initiatives and they
really helped people and we've got more
better leaders now who are diverse than
we would have before because we spent
the time on it.
But we could have done it in a way that
was a little more targeted. Like we
boiled the ocean at Facebook. We always
boiled the ocean. Like let's do
everything to the 100th% degree or we
could just do things to 90% nail the
things that really move the needle and
then just focus on the work. That's how
I looked at it. That's what just to wrap
a bow around the DEI. I that was my last
question as well. And I think we talked
about this in another segment, Nolan, is
just the as a rational person, I don't
know how you can go from zero to 100 or
 
dis can disagree with it's really
important. We need to do it. We need to
make sure it's it's productive and it's
working and we're paying attention and
it can spiral out of control and become
completely distracting and just not
helpful and actually backfire, you know,
across the original intent. I I just I
don't know how you can't see that both
those things are true. Well, I it's it's
hard because, you know, it's to to Baz's
point, it's like one group can make
another group feel like they're
otherred, you know, and so when you are
only focusing, especially like with
immunable traits, it's like, well, what
about these people and what about them?
And then it's just an escalation. And so
where like how you draw those lines, I
think it works initially because people
feel intent, right? And they know the
intent is good. But once the next person
asks a very logical reasonable question
which is like what about me and my group
then and we have to go well like we did
it over here we got to do it. So I get
it. So it's easier just to stop it 100%.
I guess what I'm saying is is are there
things we can experiment with or things
we can try or say or do that we haven't
done? That's I think where we are.
That's that's exact I think that's what
we're trying to figure out right now.
and and and people just like can't I
think there's a couple of tried and
trueue practices that work very well
like the Rooney rule works incredibly
well data proves over and over again it
does and maybe more focus on empathy
versus like there was so much argument
there was so much time I I I got calls
from our ER team all the time who just
triaged internal chat groups okay Baz
this happened this is your engineer go
talk to him like I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go
talk to him tell him that stuff's not
allowed set better moderator rules so
that we could eliminate a lot of this
intervention like make it about respect
and if you can't be respectful you get
kicked out of the group. So we had to
tighten up those things and then it went
from like this many interactions it
dropped by like 50% where we had to
intervene but if you can't be respectful
of your co-workers you don't get to work
at the company I it should be that
basic. Yeah. Well Baz, this is I mean
we've Kelly and I have been doing this
for a couple years now. This is one of
my favorite conversations we've ever
had. your level of cander is is like
unmatched. And I think anybody who
listening to this can like feel that
viscerally and so like you know me
taking away from this conversation is
like I want to be more like you. You're
probably going to get a lot of
reachouts. This was incredible. This was
incredible. Be thank you for making the
time. You guys will be my only one
because you guys are the only two people
I'm comfortable doing this. I was so s
like I didn't sleep last night. And I
was like, "Oh my god, they're not going
to Oh my god, we got to have you back
because we didn't even get to talk about
your transition to to venture capital
from all this." Like, it's really it's a
conversation I really love to have. So,
I'm loving these crypto founders.
They're really cute. And I'm gonna I'm
gonna pull a Christine Ellis on you. You
can't say no. You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coming
back. You're not gonna say no. And you
can't That is such a Christine move. If
you can't see me, we're pointing. We're
rudely pointing in the camera. You guys
are awesome. Thanks for making me feel
so comfortable. I really appreciate it
and thanks for having me on. That has
been a lot of fun. All right. Thanks
all. That was a blast. Thanks, guys. HR
