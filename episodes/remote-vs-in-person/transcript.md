inperson so I'll just start with I think
that this is a false discussion like I
think the thing I'm most sick of hearing
about is return to office and this
company's returning to office and like
oh it's like you know generally I think
employ brand it negatively um here's
here's my take however you decide to
build your company just be honest about
the company that you want to build and
if you want to build it remote first
great do that if you want to build it in
person great do that just be clear with
people about the type of company that
you want to BU to build so they can vote
with their feet it's like great if we're
building in person a lot of people now
you know turns out after 3 years of
isolation want to go back to the office
yes and that's okay I just think there's
just like this um there's so much
animosity around like is it remote or is
it in person and I my take on this is
like we all make decisions and
trade-offs in our lives I have decided
to live in Salt Lake City I moved here
in 2018 I had many people tell me your
career is over like there's nothing
there and it turns out like there's a
burgeoning texting here I thought about
that beforehand but I knew
if it was going to be an in-person
company in San Francisco I wasn't going
to be able to work at that company and I
intentionally made that trade-off and I
think as long as we're open around these
tradeoffs that we're personally making
then we can self- select in to different
types of opportunities at different
companies yeah I think I think I'll
speak for a lot of us that were were
very sick of rtoo I mean I think we're
on
year three of it now kind of um you know
it's kind of like the old HR now we're
changing it return to work just get away
from the
RT whatever uh and I I think and I I do
enjoy how it is evolving I I've always
said I think time will help this because
everyone was just all up in arms and
Maniacs about it and what's everyone
else doing and taking stances and hard
lines that then they took back and it
was just it was just very messy for a
while and and I I'm glad that kind of
it's settling down now a little bit and
I think that a lot of companies now
because of that time and the dust
settling can now have the a bit of Peace
the noise has has settled down to
actually reflect and think about who
they are because there wasn't time to do
that it was just chaos it was Google
publishing this and the no everyone was
wrapped up in that and it's like
everyone stop like think about who you
are
what you want and I think there was a
lot of fear in those years too about
taking such a stance because you know
and I get it I empathize I was there
like people didn't want to lose a bunch
of great
people they didn't want to lose by
taking such a stance yeah now three
years later I think again some of this
has settled down and myself included
people are like I like going in now like
I I want more of this and how do we just
balance it and find the right right
flexibility around it for the person the
team and the business so each of us we
make trade-offs a lot of our listeners
are are upand comers and they're earlier
in their career and I'll just reflect on
my own career I am so happy I decided to
make the hourlong commute from Meno Park
to San Francisco every day hour one way
so right two two and a half hours
roundtrip not to mention if the Cal
Train had a problem three and a half
four hours right and at the time I hated
it and it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brutal and every
time I got on that couch I was like
godamn it but because I went into the
office I was able to build amazing
relationships with people and those
relationships have paid off in Spades in
in ways I could not have anticipated yes
and so I think you know you have to
everyone has to make decisions that are
best for their own lives and we all have
extenuating circumstances with with
family and friends and and all sorts of
things but life is about trade-offs and
I think if you are early in your career
I strongly recommend you work in the
office and the reason why is you will
never build as great of a relationship
in per or on Zoom as you can in person
and you're learning by osmosis like
other people around you like these sales
bullpens um one of my investors p kangi
uh he talks about the sales Bullpen all
the time and that sales bullpen you're
just hearing other people talk and if
you're like an SDR with you know zero or
a couple years of experience maybe
you're hearing the AE that's been at it
for 10 years say something that you
never would have heard if you're in your
home office same with Engineers right I
mean similar aspect and you're right
look in reflection driving my first 10
years driving slogging down to Sunny
Veil and Mountain View in traffic and
then like the 12 years after that same
thing Cal Train not just to the office
Cal train to a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Uber and then to
the office back and forth every
day and you're right a lot of the
relationship I have today and and how I
accelerated so quickly was because
you're in there and you're next to these
people and we just recorded a segment I
talked a little bit about you know
laziness and whatnot and I'm not saying
it's a generational thing but I think I
think that that has been lost a little
bit in the comfort that folks have felt
the last three years of being in their
home I get it we have dogs and babies
and that and I I empathize with that
comfort and not saying we shouldn't have
flexibility but I I do think that we
need to see beyond that and if you're
younger in your career you gota you got
to get out there like it doesn't have to
be every day like maybe we we were but
your ass better be getting with people
this and that even if there no rules
around office create environments where
you're around people you're seeing
people in person Etc and I probably
wouldn't work for a remote first company
only unless maybe they were getting
together every month or everything like
there there's there's nuances in that
also that's super I I totally agree it's
super interesting hey everyone we'll be

you there was um when I was at door Dash
in San Francisco we used to go out to
Coffee you know like once a day or once
every other day I'll never forget we
went to coffee one time and I saw
Patrick Collison who's the CEO of stripe
in the coffee shop at Blue Bottle and I
just went up and was like Hey I'm a huge
fan of what you guys are doing and it's
like we didn't build a relationship but
like that
Serendipity doesn't happen if you're on
zoom and that's okay just as long as you
know that that's what the tradeoff is
like that is the trade-off is like if
you are in your home office you're not
interacting with other humans as much we
just we just recorded another segment on
on building your netork
it's harder to build your network if
you're remote first and but that's okay
you C you can still do it it just takes
more intentionality and it takes more
effort and so I think as you get more
agency in your career then you have the
the power of choice and you could choose
what works best for you the other thing
too I'll say is like um I think I I took
the bait early in the pandemic that like
oh all of this inperson stuff was so
stupid like why did we do it this way
and the the way the future company is
going to be built is going to be remote
first and I was all over this and I was
wrong like some companies will be built
that way other companies will be built
in person there's there's many ways to
do this but again I will just reiterate
life is about tradeoffs you will not get
everything and so you have to know when
you're going into these sorts of
situations what is the positive side of
the tradeoff and what is the negative
side the trade-off and and you know
again remote first companies if and you
go into the hood a little bit they are
getting together quite a bit most of
them that's the you know most of them
yeah and the other thing I'll say is the
energy to your point like being I I told
you I felt it in the other segment like
inertia is real right what what's what's
that rest tend to stays at rest and
what's in motion tends to stay in motion
and I don't know about the rest of you
on the audience but I'm rocking and
rolling and going I mean it just goes
it's a snowball it's you're moving
you're meeting people you're thinking of
new ideas you're getting energy and
inertia from this and when you're not
you're just kind of there yeah and it's
very easy to stay in that environment
and I just had to push myself out of it
I told you seven six months ago I said
twice a week twice once every two weeks
I'm at a dinner I'm at an event I'm at a
breakfast I'm shaking stuff up and
that's when stuff happens that's when
you learn that's when those things occur
people go through different seasons in
their lives yes right and and so when I
was in my 20s the season I was in was
work my ass off and that's all that
mattered and a lot of my friends I I
will I've said this a million times I
have five friends they're basically like
all from high school those relationships
frayed during that period what about me
I mean I love you you know that but th
those relationships did Fray during that
period because I was invest in my career
I had this really long commute but that
was a tradeoff I was making then I went
through a season to where I was like ah
like I just I want to focus and get real
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done and do impactful work and I I
I want to not have distractions like one
of the things about you know returning
to the office depending on the office
environment that you're in the open
Office floor plan for me is not
conducive to getting real work done and
so you know there was times when I was
doing this kabu I'd get home at like 8
I'd have dinner with my wife and then
I'd be on until 1:00 in the morning
because that was the time that I could
actually get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done y that was I made
that tradeoff at that time and I was
aware of that trade-off and then I went
through a different season to where I
was like actually like I I really just
want to spend my days on high impact
High Focus individual work and now I'm
I'm going through a different season to
where I want to get together with my
team more and so I think being okay
going through these seasons and
understanding that like the season that
you're in right now may not be the
season that you're in in in 5 years or
even in a year from now just being aware
that like it's okay to go through
different cycles and different changes
and to be open open to different things
at different periods in your life it is
it is and that that awareness is very
important and inquiring right to the
companies you're talking to because it's
it's not enough anymore to say oh we're
in office or we're hybrid or we're
remote first what does that mean how
does that team work that you're working
with where is the rest of the team do
they get together how do they support
like younger generation employes or not
like these are the things that are going
to be more important the next two three
years than this
silly excuse me headline than we've been
obsessed about the last three years
which is remote hybrid or in office it
is what is underneath that and how does
that connect with what's important to
you at your phase of your life to your
point totally so Kelly's dog Kelly just
slacked me and her dog ran away so she's
got to go deal with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] problem
right now uh but let us know what your
thoughts are in the comments thanks all
