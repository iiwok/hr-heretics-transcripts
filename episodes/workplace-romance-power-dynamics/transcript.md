what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment today we're
going to talk about office romance so
Kelly last week at Norfolk Southern
their CEO Alan Shaw and their Chief
legal officer uh got caught in a
relationship and caused a lot of
headaches and problems for the company
they ultimately fired both the CEO and
the chief legal officer so today I want
to talk about relationships in the
office uh both of us have experienced
this uh working at companies and having
to deal with these sorts of policies in
the past and I want to start on the
company side first so Kelly what is
let's start with like your experience
dealing with relationships in the office
and what's that look like for you
totally wait wait so what happened with
the story Nolan okay so basically the
CEO got into an intimate relationship
with the chief legal officer who was his
direct report yes and they found the
company found out and they ended up
terminating both of them got it okay
yeah look I think this happens more
often um than people might think you
know what I mean and and I've had
clients before I had one one client call
me and it was a founder
and they were having a relationship with
the the chief of staff and very worried
about it very
concerned um should we tell the board or
not and I said
listen you got to disclose this
immediately I
think again to to your story when when
the hiding kind of starts on that and
these very high stakes
situations um it's hard however I know
I've been to weddings before where
people at work have gotten married and
they're so happy and everything's great
and I think that especially when you're
you know young and working that's
usually how you meet people so it's it's
you can't avoid it you know we should
talk about the nuances because in my
experience right the the the rule the
policy on paper is to your story with
the CEO and the clo if you are in a
position of power and decision-making
Authority and influence with another
person then that is not okay but if you
are not
if you are peers if you are working as
individual contributors in different
functions right that that is okay as far
as a policy goes right okay so this is
what I want I I completely agree with
you as it relates to what is improper
certainly a reporting relationship
whether that be directly with your
manager or somebody who like uh is is
even higher above you say call it two or
three layers above you that's certainly
improper can you explain to the audience
why that's improper
it's improper basically because that
person has decision-making authority
over your well-being your life your
money y your job your
career uh it's it can be perceived as
you know being in in very uncomfortable
situations power struggles
coercion um things that are just not
aligned interest sure sure yep so now
for good or for bad right forant
or disadvantages and that's a slippery
slope when everything's hunky dory and
then it goes way downhill real
fast so so let's talk let's let's pull
this thread for a second which is love
happens right Kelly like you know
sometimes we don't get to choose who we
fall in love with and say that does
happen inside of a company where you are
the cheat people officer and you find
out about it what course of action do
you
take it's I I've seen these situations
before obviously we all right and by the
way I love this love happens side of you
it's it's it's romantic noan it's great
I mean you know that's it's in there
Kelly uh look I think you have to stay
objective right one number one I go
what's the relationship what what is the
reporting relationship what is the power
hierarchy here what is the influence
relationship so let's just be clear on
that first two how is this playing out
in the organization sometimes no one
knows about it
other times the rumor mill is like
wildfire and it's distracting it's
causing all sorts of issues a big mess
uh so you have to kind of like
understand what you're dealing with
before you jump in and start talking to
these people because they they could
tell the truth they could spin you up
they could lie I mean all sorts of
messiness can come of this so I'm always
number one what is the situation who are
these people what is their relationship
and how is this playing out in the
organization you know in in what
capacity and then you have to talk to
these people and go from there but it it
literally could take 50 different turns
you just you never you never know and
sometimes you got to separate people
from the
organization yeah I look I tend to agree
I feel like it starts with the company
policy and you know a lot of the
companies that you and I work with are
startups and they don't have policy on
these issues yet and so the way that
they Define policy often happens when a
situation occurs and then they start to
codify policy around that um this one
for me is a very hard red line to where
you cannot be dating somebody that is in
your reporting uh in your reporting
chain like period full stop and so what
I would do in this situation is say like
the relationship must end um before
terminating and if there wasn't a policy
in place if there was a policy in place
I would go straight to
determination and I think you have to do
it for sure for the the leader um for
the subordinate I I think it's a case-
by casee basis what's your take on I I
agree with that I mean the the
subordinate here it's it's tough because
a lot of these cases you know that don't
that don't end well and and go badly
it's it's usually you know a more senior
person with a more Junior person a
subordinate or whatnot and it's it's
really it's really hard situation and I
just I I I go back to the human nature
of things right if this is on paper why
is this happening I mean that's a whole
another conundrum we can we could talk
about is is when these things happen and
they do happen they happen a lot I think
more often than we might think it's just
to your point the policies or the
actions or the things that escalate it
it doesn't really happen until those
things blow up right and bad things
occur and and and to your point it's
just everyone's watching this you know
what I mean like yeah if it comes up
everyone everyone knows everyone's
talking about Everyone's Watching and so
the actions you take it's very precedent

metav view. a/h Heretics to talk to one
of metav VI's product experts or get
started for free you'll be up running an
AI enabled in
minutes all right let me give you a
hypothetical um so CEO of a tech
company uh starts dating you know one of
call it like you know an L4 in the
organization what do you do as cheap
people off in that
 
situation that's going to be complicated
I mean everyone just listening is
probably like fire the CEO that's great
that that that's probably like where
that ends I'm just being realistic and
real that there's a whole web of
complications in there with the board
and right the business and the CEO being
critical if it's a Founder it's even I'd
argue more sticky uh and and complicated
and
again what is the context how did this
happen I mean usually they might deny it
Etc that it's it's just a hard situation
however the CEO should not be dating L4
let's just write first principles that
should not happen and so that's where I
end up on it I'm just telling you I've
been through the ringer on this a couple
times it's it's sticky and complicated
and maybe disheartening but the real the
real deal is it's it's it's harder to do
that you know with with folks than you
might think in these situations on paper
it's black and white and it's like duh
and then you get into real life and all
the pressures and all the pulls and all
the loyalties and all the you know
dependencies it actually gets pretty
sticky well don't forget who signs your
track
too and I actually think that that in
this case that is actually one of the
hardest things that people don't talk
about is when impropriety happens of
this nature you know you you know gets
to your desk usually because the rumor
Bill happened um and then all of a
sudden you are put into this impossible
situation as the chief people officer to
where your boss who signs your checks
who you know makees sure that you are
employed you are the one who has to go
like regulate that situation yeah um but
I agree with you you have to like talk
to talk to each side understand the
facts and then I think you have to like
talk to board members about that yeah
because you can't move forward without
oh of course you have to talk to board
members but there's protections there I
mean you're not going to you're not
going to get fired as a CPO for doing
the right thing I mean that that's it's
less about getting fired and it's more
about the relationship between you and
your
boss and this is one of those like
hollowed grounds that we haven't really
covered on you know in the show is when
you know your boss is the one that's
doing something that's
nefarious and it's impendent upon you
yeah to ensure that the company is
abiding by company
policy and you know how you handle that
um I don't think there is one right
answer I think it's circumstance depends
sure and you have to go Case by case on
these things right and and usually I've
I haven't come across many cases where
right the CPO the chief people officer
doesn't
have help right or um momentum to help
them have that conversation because the
CEO's dat in L4 I'd bet money more money
than not that it's being talked about
and rumors are flying or it's it's
having some effect on the organization
that that she people officer can point
to not just hey I know about this I'm
the only one that knows about this now
it's all on me that is very rare I've
never come across that so then that
conversation becomes less about the CPO
and the CEO relationship and more about
the company and the organization and
having to do the right thing because
more people know about this than just
that CPO if that makes sense that's
really well said I I think so let's put
that let's put a pin in that one I think
the other so we've talked about the
issues of impropriety as it relates to
the reporting relationship and having
any sort of like direct line into a
leader what do you think about like a
leader in a different or dating a
younger employee and an or that doesn't
report up to them yeah I I still think
that that for me is a big no no right
because if we talk about power and
influence right these leaders we we all
we have cross functional leadership team
meetings we have cross functional
calibration sessions where we talk about
employees performance and their pay if
they're going to get promoted I mean so
those leaders still have influence on
junior level employees and different
function
in the organization yep right yep okay
agreed so I I I think what you and I are
saying is in almost no case should there
be some sort of uh level difference
between employees that are having
relationships or at least maybe
leadership is the delineation for us is
like if you're a leader you should not
be dating employees at your company
period full stop that is an very easy
rule for people to follow yeah and if
you don't your employment is a risk
right and and if and if you know a dear
point is Love Is Love if if you need to
date them one of you has to
leave one of you has to leave the
company and I I just we have to be real
that these things happen look at sports
how many you know players date their
coaches or end up dating their coaches I
can count to five right now in my head
just whether in it's personal not me but
whether it's in my personal life like
college teams or professional right
these things they do happen that yeah
those that gets really hairy for me and
I I just feel like given the power
Dynamic at play for me it's just like it
should be a red line for leaders that
you should not cross and if you do cross
that line you are the one that is
accepting the risk as it relates to your
not only your employment but also your
reputation yeah and this is where like
when they do cross that line and get
away with it so to speak because of all
the things you mentioned right power
this that this is where we perpetuate
like the inequities and all the things
that that you know C cause these things
to have a bad brand politics seniority
taking advantage it's it's not fair and
that that just perpetuates these you
know these conversations about again
equality and Equity level equality
Equity like it should be that that that
should be equal and I I've you know when
when folks get away with that we're not
we're not doing the right things around
those yeah my my big you know my big
thing is I want to ultimately strive for
a meritocracy and how can you have a
meritocracy where you have those power
IM balances there's just no way for sure
all right let's go to the more positive
frame on this which is you know call it
colleagues who are on different teams
right and you know call it at the same
level both individual contributors you
know they they meet at a company
function they start to dates things are
going
well do they have to disclose that
relationship to HR
Kelly yeah that's a great point that
that was the other that was the other
final like black and white line in the
policy document and the company if
you're going to have a relationship
disclose it and many people have come to
me and disclose their relationships over
the years and many have worked out
brilliantly I again I can count I can
think of 10 couples in my head right now
that met at work they have families I've
been to their weddings over the years
like that's wonderful so I I've I've
seen that and one of the biggest myths
is you know let's not disclose it
because they're not going to support it
we're going to get in trouble that's
just not
true oh interesting right so you think
that their concern is we we're going to
get in trouble for being in a
relationship and so it's just better for
us not to tell anybody about it and keep
it hidden in secret yeah I think that's
less now but if I look back eight 10
years it was it was more rare for people
to come forward than it is now you know
yeah yeah I I I agree with you there's a
lot yeah there's a lot of great stories
you know the other sticky one is when
those peers it goes bad and it causes so
much distraction dysfunction the
organization that's where the the hard
spot is for people leaders is being
objective and saying look this
relationship's dead and gone but y'all
are bringing it in it's affecting
execution it's affecting the team it's
you know that that noise can be very
distracting and sometimes that has to
result in someone leaving or being
transferred I've seen that before as
well wow yeah I mean I totally agree
with you when a relationship ends you
must continue to remain professional to
the other person and it almost needs to
be like it didn't happen because if you
are bringing those distractions into the
workplace your employment becomes at
risk because you're now risking how
people get worked on yeah it becomes a
performance issue right whether it's
Behavior or execution or any mix of the
two um for sure yeah the other one that
we didn't talk about is when people make
advances on colleagues like asking
somebody out and the colleague
declines I think there needs to be a
Hardline that you cannot ask more than
once totally that's when this is where
like the mandatory harassment video
trainings come in do you know what I
mean Advance no and then other odd
advances which I've seen and heard of
especially when there's functions and
people get a few drinks in them and say
or do some really odd things absolutely
not yeah you know read the room read the
room re read the room though is actually
kind of like tough I you know this is
one of those areas where I've evolved on
you know I I used to joke with my legal
counterpart that our our policy document
should just be one sentence which is be
adults yeah
the problem is is that there's so much
Nuance in gray area in especially like
this this sort of a a problem and so I
actually think as an HR leader I would
recommend you potify exactly like what
is okay what is not okay and what is the
expectation if you end up in a
relationship because people don't know
how to handle these things and be an
adult even though like I I really wish
the world could be that way is so
aspirational beyond like what is
possible for an employee they need a
playbook for how to like go about
handling these situations yes you're
right I mean I I'm the same way I'm like
right use judgment being an adult and I
was shocked at at I told you when we
started this this
founder you know not wanting to disclose
his relationship with the chief of stat
and I couldn't believe it so you're
correct it's
definitely out there and it's not going
away humans are humans so codify it and
you know hope for the best because there
are good stories out there yeah there's
a yeah I mean I personally know a couple
that is married that works with my wife
and they're like the best people we've
hung out with them a bunch of times
they've been together for like 10 years
working in the same company for 10 years
it's like a huge success story the other
thing I just quickly want to hit on is
in a world that is becoming so much more
digital and it is so much harder to like
actually interact and meet people and
then you know call it like doing due
diligence on those people right because
like you know if you meet somebody on a
dating app like you don't know
about them versus if you're working with
them every day I mean it it makes sense
that those are the people that we
gravitate towards and so my guidance to
HR leaders is to codify these policies
even though it's a pain in the ass
because it's going to come up it's just
 
numbers the more people you have in your
company the more likely this is going to
happen and if you codify it just around
the things that do come up you're
missing many other things yeah yeah so
yeah so leave the room to be able to
adapt and grow the policy as you deal
with that we haven't covered in
this conversation cool let us know what
you guys think thanks all HR Heretics is
