to where they're literally not sleeping
for days at a time their managers are
 
for days at a time their managers are
asking for things that are not necessary

actually talking about it because this
literally like veteran Army veteran
 
literally like veteran Army veteran
committed suicide because likely because
 
committed suicide because likely because
of these conditions people are talking
 
of these conditions people are talking
about so you know I think in general um
 
about so you know I think in general um
couple of thoughts for me so as I've
 
couple of thoughts for me so as I've
gotten older one of the things that I've
 
gotten older one of the things that I've
realized is is that there's a point of
 
realized is is that there's a point of
diminishing returns for my quality of
 
diminishing returns for my quality of
work and I think what's happening to me
 
work and I think what's happening to me
as I've gotten older is that that point
 
as I've gotten older is that that point
of diminishing returns has gotten
 
of diminishing returns has gotten
