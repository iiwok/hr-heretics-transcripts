hey everybody HR heretic segment on
toxic managers so before we get into it
we've had a lot of audience members ping
us with questions we want more of that
and so please ping us your questions or
stuff that you want us to cover you can
find me and Kelly really easily on
LinkedIn and so as a reminder just hit
us up if there's something that's top of
mind for you all that you want us to
talk about hit us up so getting into
this week's segment we have two stories
we want to cover which I will bundle
Under the Umbrella of toxic managers the
first is a
BYO uh
executive um who was fired actually from
Buu who had said some crazy things to
her staff which I'll let Kelly elaborate
on in a second
and the second story is around a couple
of I Bankers U most notably one uh who
was an Army veteran at uh at BFA uh who
committed suicide um this story is
actually blowing up on Reddit right now
because in the iBanking Community a lot
of people are coming out and saying that
they've been working 100 hour weeks that
their managers are absolutely insane
that there is no rest like these people
are working two or three days in a row
without breaks um and unfortunately
suicide is becoming more common in the
industry because of the working
conditions so Kelly what's your what
your what's your take on these
stories yeah I mean these are obviously
noan and I you were talking earlier
they're very very intense right they're
they're like maybe they're spikes or um
ve very sad very um big big deal
situations that I don't think you see
necessarily day-to-day I hope not but I
did read about them especially this this
woman uh cuing right the Chinese Tech
executive uh and some of the things she
was saying to employees and some of
these things included you know quotes
like I'm not your mother-in-law I'm not
your mom I only care about your results
right um Someone's Child was crying in
the background she kept texting at night
and says why should it might be my
business that your child is crying um
and the I believe these were on video so
it's not like these were secondhand
statements right these are these are
captured on video and I think she she
owned those those quotes uh and just a
pretty ruthless leader right and I think
you know if those of you will show the
the picture here in a minute on YouTube
but some of the tactics here and some of
the acts I've actually never seen some
like this in my career and we have it on
so Kelly Kelly describe this photo
describe this photo to to listeners who
don't have access to video yeah for sure
so there is something that upset her
right um basically local news in China
the Chinese morning post captured these
videos of her treating people verbally
very poorly I mean clearly verbally
abuse verbal abuse and harassment I
would say and she didn't like that so
she cut out a paper kind of a half of
the size of a human doll and hung it
from a coat hanger in the office uh
literally hanging from the coat hanger
something you'd kind of see in a horror
film and it says
scmp on the body like the t-shirt which
is the Chinese morning post and above
that uh there are four drawings of four
knives you know and these knives are in
red I mean this isn't an office I'm
seeing I'm seeing cubes behind it I mean
I'm seeing literally an office and I
will be honest noan it did impact me I I
paused for a minute and my my my jaw was
a gape and I was like oh my God like
what what is happening here um and you
know mental health came into my head
pressure came into my head um you know
these these tweets and whatnot with the
analysts and just that pressure and
succumbing to that pressure um yeah and
I think it's really sad and was really
jarring for
me yeah um so I'll hit on the the I
banking stuff so this came up in a
couple of different channels for me um
most notably on Reddit and there's a
couple of threads going on Reddit right
now of anonymous I Bankers talking about
their experiences working in the field
and the things that they're bringing up
is like these crazy working conditions
to where they're literally not sleeping
for days at a time their managers are
asking for things that are not necessary
but because they're in positions of
power leveraging the power like it's a
power Dynamic that has to get done um
and they're pushing these people so far
to the brink that many of them um are
just like not only like exhausted I
think is like the the lightest way to
describe it like these are people that
are on the
brink and uh and so now people are
actually talking about it because this
literally like veteran Army veteran
committed suicide because likely because
of these conditions people are talking
about so you know I think in general um
couple of thoughts for me so as I've
gotten older one of the things that I've
realized is is that there's a point of
diminishing returns for my quality of
work and I think what's happening to me
as I've gotten older is that that point
of diminishing returns has gotten
earlier in the day and so like I try and
carve out like my deepest work for the
first thing and then putting meetings
off till later in the day because I'm
just I'm not as good at Deep work later
in the day I think for managers that are
trying to squeeze as much out of these
employees as
possible you're not going to get quality
like it's just so obvious to say but
it's just like you're not going to get
quality from these people if you're
pushing to them them to the brink
constantly now on the other hand as I
was telling you before we started
recording um our head to go to market
last night did this Reddit post that
like went super viral and we had to like
go respond to a bunch of people and
that's like those things come up and you
do need to have all hands on deck but
all hands on deck all the time for
knowledge
workers you're just not going to get
quality out of
people hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where

[Music]
you you're going to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quality out
of people um and you're going to burn
them out and they're going to resent you
and I just you know one somebody once
said you can either lead by love or you
can lead by fear and I think these
people that are leading by fear are
ultimately going to see poor results um
they're going to see very high turnover
especially from their top performers and
I think their customers are going to
feel it too yeah I mean we we've we've
talked a lot about in the show that this
this
Universal um kind of theme of trust
first right punish last um don't don't
solve the apoll policy solve via right
treating people like adults and doing
the right thing and you said it exactly
right is that these tactics of leading
by
fear um and pressure and just the stick
mentality it's you see what happens I
mean at best people give you half of
themselves they're not committed they're
doing work for paycheck at worst these
really bad things are happening and I
would air on the side of abuse um and it
just makes me it just makes me really
ill and it's real and it's and I know
these two things are kind of um very
intense examples but I knew someone that
I worked with back when I was 24 and
they committed suicide and I won't talk
about the details but I thought this
person had it all together they were
high high visible leader very polished
very intense very driven um kind of made
me feel bad at times they were older
than me and they were a little
not not not too nice and and you don't
realize what's going on behind the
surface with this so I would say I even
have empathy for some of these leaders
like what is happening that's causing
this but it's irrespective it does not
work yeah I think we've had an
era that we're you know we're getting
out of to where things got really good
and people
um there was a lot of embellishment for
how working conditions were really hard
and and I think what you you saw is this
swing back as the macro has changed to
be like no we need to be more intense
and we need to grind more and now I
think we're seeing like it's going in
some in many cases it's going too far
I'll tell you that I'm in a bunch of
founder
chats and um the overarching theme in
the in the founder chats is that people
aren't working hard
enough and I you know I really have been
taking a step back and thinking about
this and then also talking to people
individually about this and I think
we're throwing the baby out with the ba
the bath water like yes there's a couple
of people who aren't working you should
manage those people and you should
manage them out of your
organization but when you
conflate amount of time with outputs and
results I don't think it ends up with it
doesn't end up helping anybody like we
should be optimized for good results
especially in the knowled worker space
is like if you if you have somebody
who's absolutely crushing it and it
takes them 5 hours a day to do it like
great that's that's an awesome that's an
awesome outcome for the business and I
think um with this macro change right
now you're seeing Founders use it as an
opportunity to get people back in the
office which is a short hand for like I
want to make sure that you're at your
desk for as many hours a day as possible
and I think that's the thing that that
employees are going to push back on and
they rightly should push back on because
what we should be optimized for is
outputs and results yeah yeah yeah and
you know the the the office thing which
I empathize with too is a cultural thing
it's not just let me watch you all day
it's hey let's let's find a Time whether
it's quarterly or weekly or monthly or
daily for some companies for for humans
to be in the same space certainly for
camaraderie and and all those things
which I agree with so and we talked
about this earlier with a guest it's
like it's not one answer like all all
things are true like yes some employees
take advantage and yes they should be
called on it yes they're not being
productive but is it to the level that
we read in this article with this woman
I mean that is insane uh and so for me
there is an element of nuance there's an
element of judgment and there is an
element of
EQ that is just really necessary um in
leading and a a lot of leaders don't
have that they weren't taught that they
weren't expected to have that yeah and
i' I've said this before on but you know
you definitely learn more from Bad
managers than you do from good ones and
so if you're somebody who is going
through one of these situations right
now all I can tell you is start looking
for a new job like it's I have I've seen
so many times and and look people are
growth-minded and people do change
certainly but they often don't change
until something serious
happens and with managers that have been
poor managers I've noticed they really
improve until a great employee
leaves yeah and I I have been in
situations where I have I mean nothing
to the aspect of the two articles we
just referenced you know our situations
but I I've been very unhappy right very
down very kind of belittled and guess
what I was like suck it up you should
stay in this situation I mean it was
almost like a b you know what I mean and
I think your point is well taken that
you don't have to do that it doesn't
mean that You' failed it you know and
and to really just because it starts
eating away with eating away at you
right um and that's not good that's
where Community I think really matters
and having your tribe like really
matters and and I think when you when
you think about building that tribe
you're going to want differing
perspectives because I think what we
hear a lot of now is the stuff that we
really want to hear and we associate
with those people versus like having
somebody who's going to say something
maybe that like you need to hear but
maybe don't want to hear and so in that
example Kelly right it's clear like you
stayed longer and because your your own
selft talk was like I I I need to push
through this and um I would just
encourage people to like when stuff like
this happens to you or when you're
experiencing it at work that you have a
diverse set of opinions that you can
talk to people about um and also outside
of your industry is another angle of
diversity that I don't I don't think we
talk a lot about like a lot of my
friends are like electricians and doing
lines work on the power Poes outside and
when I come with some of my complaints
they're like dude you're soft or
sometimes they're like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man
like that's way more intense than I
expected yeah you playing poker back
angles playing poker back
there yeah chips God uh yes I agree with
all of that and and I'll just second
what Nolan said like we get a lot of
great requests around spicy segments and
things that are uncomfortable to talk
about and keep those coming I mean my my
