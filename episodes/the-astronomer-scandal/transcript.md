# The Astronomer Scandal

## Transcript

 
[Applause]
[Music]
 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics. Kelly,
we're finally going to do it. We're
finally going to talk about astronomers
today.
&gt;&gt; I can't believe it. People have been
saying, "When are you guys going to talk
about it?" And I say, "Well, everyone's
been talking about it. do we really need
to kick this tire again? And then like,
well, we want to hear your take on it.
And Nolan was fishing and river rafting
for a week. So,
&gt;&gt; I was whitewater rafting. Uh I now, to
be fair, I saw it happen and then I was
like, it was like two days before I was
on the river and then I was on the river
and then we had this like Gwennneth
Paltro thing that dropped like two days.
So, I actually think it's a better time
to talk about it now because we will
have the entire story. So if you have
been under a rock or uh away from your
phone forever, uh what you missed was
astronomer's CEO and chief people
officer at a Coldplay concert, you know,
just taking in a concert together as one
does. And Coldplay did like the kiss cam
thing to where the CEO like had his arms
around chief people officer who's a
female. Uh CEO is a male. And when it
got to them, they like ducked out of the
way. And the head singer for Coldplay,
which I can't pretend to know this
person's name because I'm not the
biggest Coldplay, whatever,
&gt;&gt; was like, "Oh, like, you know, it looks
like they might be having an affair."
&gt;&gt; So,
&gt;&gt; yeah.
&gt;&gt; Turns out,
&gt;&gt; you know, either they're really, really
shy or we're having an
&gt;&gt; That's right. Turns out, uh, this is the
CEO and chief people officer of
Astronomer, which is a $1.3 billion
company that has raised hundreds and
hundreds of millions in venture capital.
And so I guess like Kelly, let's start
from the beginning, which is, you know,
what's your take on this part of the
situation, right? So the story drops,
right? He they get outed the very next
morning. I wake up to uh I wake up to a
text from friend of the show David
Hanahan being like, "Did you see this
astronomer shit?" And I was like, "It's
 
Like, and I was like, "Oh my god." So,
what's your take on the original like,
"Hey, story drops. How do we handle
things? What's going on in the world?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm glad we're talking about this
because we're just going to keep it, you
know, raw and direct, a little bit light
maybe. Um, you know, honestly, just
speaking as a human, my first reaction
because my wife and I went to see
Coldplay, as I told you,
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry to hear that.
&gt;&gt; Right before his name is not whatever,
his name is Chris.
&gt;&gt; Sure, whatever.
&gt;&gt; We went to see them at Stanford, you
know, I don't know, a month before,
whatever. And this concert was in
Boston. So, and they did the same thing,
you know, these these cam things. Not
all of them are kiss cams, by the way.
He just checks in on people, asks them
if they're okay. So, but there's
probably five or six of them total.
Maybe eight of these for what what is
 
And yeah, so I got to be honest with
you. I have a lot of thoughts about this
and we will talk about it in all
seriousness, but my first reaction I
called Hillary, my wife, and I said, "Oh
my god, what are the odds on this?" Ask
Chat GPT to do this math. what are the
odds that they're gonna get chosen? And
I kind of was like, "Oh, I kind of,
dude, I kind of feel a little bit bad
for that.
&gt;&gt; What is it, like 0.00001?
&gt;&gt; Those odds are incredible." And she
goes, "That was probably planned." I'm
like, "Okay, it was not it was not
planned." So,
&gt;&gt; definitely not planned. Well, first of
all, yes, for those of us on the line
here, clearly not you, Nolan, that that
entertain Coldplay concerts, um, very
slim odds of that happening.
&gt;&gt; Okay,
&gt;&gt; that was my first, you know, silly
reaction.
&gt;&gt; Uh, my second reaction, and I want your
reaction to this, is
if it weren't for the Coldplay concert
fun, which I think put a lot of
entertainment factor around this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you think this would have
gotten as much attention?
And the reason I say that is because
this happens a lot. And I'm not talking
about chief people officer CEO
obviously, but I'm talking about this
dynamic. I think it happens more than we
might think. And
&gt;&gt; yes,
&gt;&gt; um, you know, I'll just keep this high
level. Like I have a friend from the
past I worked with you know 20 years ago
and
you know they were at a company I I
assuming the relationship was not you
know not happening while they were there
but now they're married and
&gt;&gt; etc etc and this was a chief people
officer CEO situation. So I just I know
I I just it's an honest question. Again
I have a lot of thoughts on the the
ethics around this and blah blah blah.
So don't please don't you know
misunderstand but this happens a lot and
my question is do you think it would
have gotten this attention if it didn't
happen in this way?
&gt;&gt; I mean of of course not is the answer
but
let me start with like I feel like this
is karmic justice. Um like I it's not
even the infidelity like let me just
like set that aside. It's it's more of
the hypocrisy. And this is why this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
went hyper viral. Like I think the
infidelity piece like kind of was the
was the kindling to the social media
stuff. But the hypocrisy is the forest
fire. Like that's why this stuff went
hyperfiral. And the hypocrisy here is
we've all been inside companies to where
you know the CEO and the chief people
are officer like we're a family. you
know, we're in this together, like all
this and like there also there's that's
one aspect. Another aspect is is like
you often get these people uh
specifically in the CTO role who kind of
act like the the moral authority.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Right. Like you know, they're the ones
who are supposed to be the role models
for everyone else.
They're also the ones that are creating
all the structure and rules inside of a
company, right? So like you know who
decides whose pay? Well, those are the
two people at the top of the food chain
who are seeing every single comp sheet.
And so for me, like when I saw this, it
was just like, wow. Like
&gt;&gt; like karma does exist. Like yes,
infidelity, like that's bad, but doing
this in this way to where it's disclosed
to nobody. Uh there seems to be
conflicting reports on the person next
to them. Was that the HR lady? Was it
not? I actually still don't know today
if that's true. Um, but regardless, it
doesn't matter because look, when you're
at one of these big companies, this is a
big company that matters.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You are not subject to the rights of Joe
the plumber who owns a five person
company in Salt Lake, right? Who can do
whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he wants. Nobody cares
about Joe and his and his small
business. This is a $1.3 billion v
business. Hundreds of millions of
dollars in investment capital has been
poured into this company. When you take
one of these jobs, you don't get the
same rights as rank and file employee.
And so, you know, the other thing is
it's like you don't get to make the same
mistakes as everyone else.
And so, um, there was a lot of of
consternation that next day before I
went out on the on the river about like,
well, I don't think that they're going
to get fired. Like, I would be shocked.
And I'm like, are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kidding
me? Like, these people must go
yesterday. Like, this is just like the
ultimate form of hypocrisy. they can no
longer be here at this company because
part of the job of being an executive,
especially a sea-level executive,
especially at a company that matters is
people look up to you. That's part of
the job description
&gt;&gt; and they failed.
&gt;&gt; And th and those two roles specifically,
I know I mentioned this hap, this
happens, etc. Those two roles, right,
not marketing, not revenue, not that the
CEO and the people leader like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think if I asked 10 reasonable
humans like what are the two roles in a
seauite that are you know probably most
looked at for upholding X Y and Z across
the company it's those two roles so that
combination
is insane to me and um you know as
someone in that role
in many companies you are absolutely
right when you walk in those doors or
you show up to a Zoom meeting right
everything that you do from your
decisions to your communication style,
to what you stand for, how you
communicate your facial expressions.
People look up and are watching and and
what went through my head more so than
anything in these roles is the
responsibility that we have to those
humans.
Otherwise, what are you doing? Do you
know what I mean? Like it it's like
looking in the mirror and saying one
thing and doing the exact opposite. I
don't know
how you reconcile those things day in
and day out.
&gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
&gt;&gt; I Exactly. So like I you know I had a a
quick post on LinkedIn and I would say
so taking the other side right like so
you've heard how Kelly and I think about
this you know taking the other side of
what what other people are saying um
they're saying well it's none of our
business like this is the worst moment
of their lives and now it's been
broadcast on social media like don't
contribute to that
and what I got to say to these people is
guys how much do you think these people
make like
part of making that much money, having
that title, having all of these people
report to you and look up to you and
having investors trust you with their
money is that you have a good head on
your shoulders.
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; And you're making thoughtful decisions
about all aspects of your life. I I
continue to believe, Kelly, that there
is no such thing as work over here and
life over here, especially if you're an
exec. One person once told me if they
put a V or a C in front of your name,
they own you. And that has been so true.
I have seen this with so many friends,
which is, oh my god, like my whole life
is this company. Like, yeah, like you
make $4 million a year. You make
professional athlete money. If you want
to like do something else, go do that.
But the trade-off is is that like you
don't get to make as much and you get to
live in obscurity.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; This is a public profile job. Every
single one of these venture back
companies that has raised this much
money at this valuation. You have a
public profile. That's just what it is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. And I mean, look at look at
candidates, right? I mean, I think you
think people would be lying if they
didn't say for any type of candidate in
the past, have you gone on social media?
Have you looked at who they are?
&gt;&gt; Totally. I do it every time. I do it
every time.
&gt;&gt; You do it every time. So, so that is,
you know, and I've talked to, you know,
dozens and dozens and dozen of people
that do the same thing. And that is an
exact proof of these these these lives
now being intertwined. Um, and I'm not
here to talk about, you know, the
adultery or this or that. That back to
those folks that say they shouldn't have
their lives, you know, thrown out there.
This isn't about that. This is about
work and the responsibility that they
took in in that position at that
company. So, that's kind of, you know,
personal feelings on the other side of
it. anyone can say you know all their
opinions but you're absolutely right
that when you are in a high level
position of power that's very visible
that is meant to serve others that's the
job right is is is serving and showing
others the right thing
you're going to get you're going to get
blown up out there and it doesn't just
go for business and what we're talking
about it goes for anything look what's
happening in politics like if you are in
a position of power doing not good
things. It's going to be talked about.
&gt;&gt; That's just the world we live in.
&gt;&gt; It's the world we live in.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talented signal fire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metave is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. MeteView changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
MeteView covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metaview. Head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metab's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
&gt;&gt; That's just what it is. like this isn't,
you know, 1920s anymore. And, you know,
you can like do shady things with your
employees at really highpowered
important companies. Like, you just have
too much there's there's just too much
visibility today, right? Like, and we
saw this this, you know, the the good
analog here is like layoffs. Like,
remember the better.com layoff? Remember
how much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Vashall the CEO took for
doing that layoff? And like everyone was
like, "Yeah, like this guy's an
asshole."
&gt;&gt; And like,
&gt;&gt; is that the one that got recorded? Is
that the one that someone recorded it?
That's right. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is this is the same thing.
It's just like guys, like everybody now,
everybody has an iPhone. Everybody's
recording everything. And so like what
like I don't want to project my morals
onto somebody and I'm not going to moral
grandstand, but I what I will say is is
like if you're too obtuse to realize
that other people might know who you are
like in public,
&gt;&gt; it you're dumb. Like you're just dumb.
Now if it happened behind closed doors,
&gt;&gt; right, I might have a different take. I
still have an issue with the the
subordinate relationship, especially
like sea level to sea level without
board knowledge. I have I still have an
issue with that, but I would be much
more sensitive to these two people if it
was like behind closed doors and like
some sort of tape came out, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I love that you said that
because I think you're going to get lit
up for that. Um,
&gt;&gt; in what way?
&gt;&gt; Like I think Nolan's just going to get
lit up for that. Um because it's it's
it's I I don't I feel the opposite. Um
&gt;&gt; and the reason I feel the opposite is
because of everything I just said about
those roles and the decision making that
that you're doing. Whether you're at a
Coldplay concert, which like why would
you go to that? Why would you go to that
first of all? Whether you're at the
Coldplay concert or in a basement where
no one can see you, it is still a
decision that I fundamentally believe
impacts the way that you interact and
run the company together and that
impacts the hundreds or thousands of
people that you are responsible for.
&gt;&gt; Yes, I agree. I think that's a good
take. Now, look, play it out with me.
We're in a hypothetical,
right? Things happen. They fall in love,
&gt;&gt; right? Let's just let's just pretend the
audience will love this. Let's pretend
let's pretend that I'm
Let's pretend that I'm the CEO and you
are the chief people of
&gt;&gt; Let's not do that.
&gt;&gt; And I are in love. That is wonderful.
&gt;&gt; You You need to choose your You need to
choose what world you're going to give
up.
&gt;&gt; Uh no, I don't No, I disagree. So, I
what I would do uh I don't know what I
would do because I would never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the
situation, but what you should do is
tell the board.
&gt;&gt; You should tell the board and say, "Hey,
like we want to put everything on the
table." Things happened. Kelly and I
fell in love. Right.
&gt;&gt; This has been incredible.
&gt;&gt; I can't believe you used I'm so glad you
did this. Even though
&gt;&gt; I'm I'm now uncomfortable. Uh which is
rare.
So I I that's that has to be the thing
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; Has to be
&gt;&gt; I skipped over that because that is just
table stakes to me. You you
&gt;&gt; but that's not what happened here,
right? So
&gt;&gt; that's not what happened here. But no,
if we you say listen here's the deal.
And if you're
a board that's worth your salt, you're
going to say one of you has to go. Like
this can't
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's definitely the chief
people officer by the way.
&gt;&gt; Probably. But
&gt;&gt; yeah. And then what you know what
they're going to do? They're going to
they're going to say, "Okay, well
there's probably some sort of severance,
right? Because it's weird for the
company, weird for the CPO."
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; Like
&gt;&gt; it'll be like all the all the exit
departures we've talked about the last
two days.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; I'm just telling you, we know what
relationships are like. We know that
they're not objective. So, I I really do
not believe that you would run the
company the same and have the same
dynamics if that if you weren't
together. I really don't. And that
that's and that impacts the business and
that impacts the people that again that
you're responsible for. So, that's my f
that's my final
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You're totally right because
like the thing that I always preach is
merit and this is what I was like
preaching on LinkedIn is like I believe
in meritocracies and I know a lot of
people have just collectively rolled
their eyes and shut their podcast app
off. I do like I I you know it's kind of
like you know it's like the United
States. It's like there is no such thing
as a perfect democracy but like we're
trying to make it more perfect every
day. Um, and I I do believe in that. And
when you have a relationship like this,
especially between these two roles, it
just can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be true. Like,
&gt;&gt; it cannot be true. Like, there is way
too much
personal stuff that's now in every
conversation. Not just comp, right? Not
just like terminations, but like in the
exec meeting. Like, can you imagine the
exec meeting dynamics of this, Kelly?
Like, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is happening in
there?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It will never
ever work. And
anyway,
&gt;&gt; yeah, you're right. Okay, so then Okay,
so okay, but so like let's go back to
the story. So luckily we're recording
today because over the weekend, did you
see the Gwennneth Paltro thing?
&gt;&gt; Are you kidding me?
&gt;&gt; I didn't I had so you know we're all
friends here on the show. I had my mom
celebration of life on Saturday people
over this house. It was incredible. So I
just kind of my in-laws were in and I I
didn't look at anything.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so astronomer
launches on Twitter. Maybe the best
response to this situation possible. All
right, here we go.
&gt;&gt; Do you just want to explain it to me? I
&gt;&gt; No, you have to see it.
 
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your interest in
Astronomer. Hi, I'm Gwyneith Paltro.
I've been hired on a very temporary
basis to speak on behalf of the 300 plus
employees at Astronomer. Astronomer has
gotten a lot of questions over the last
few days and they wanted me to answer
the most common ones.
Yes, Astronomer is the best place to run
Apache Airflow, unifying the experience
of running data, ML, and AI pipelines at
scale. We've been thrilled so many
people have a newfound interest in data
workflow automation. As for the other
questions we've received,
 
yes, there is still room available at
our Beyond Analytics event in September.
We will now be returning to what we do
best, delivering gamechanging results
for our customers. Thank you for your
interest in Astronomer.
 
&gt;&gt; So, the tweet is, "Thank you for your
interest in astronomer.
They paid Gwennneth Paltro to come on
and essentially like twist the story
away from CPO CEO into, hey, here's what
Apache Airflow is, which I still don't
understand. Oh, by the way, we have this
conference coming up. Oh, by the way, we
have 300 people who work here and like
they're dope. I like marketing geniuses.
And I got to give like a massive round
of applause to one whoever the
psychopath was that decided to pitch
this idea. You you my friend, you have
you have screws loose and I like where
they're loose. And number two, the board
for being like, let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] roll it.
Like what? Who in their right mind would
ever do this? And it's the perfect play.
It it completely meets the social media
moment of what they're in. I was like,
"Oh my god, if I wanted to go be a chief
people officer again, you know where I'd
want to go do it? Astronomer." Like
 
&gt;&gt; master class.
&gt;&gt; You're a screw loose, too. I found that
embarrassing.
 
&gt;&gt; What? So So you know what my takeaway
was? I mean, yeah, it's hilarious. I
have a great sense of humor. I get it.
But honestly, my takeaway is you're just
going to ignore this whole thing
&gt;&gt; and not
&gt;&gt; ignoring it. Ignore it.
&gt;&gt; Not acknowledge anything. You're just
going to kind of make a joke about it.
&gt;&gt; I That was one of my reactions, dude.
&gt;&gt; All right. All right. It's a fair. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I I mean, I guess like my
take is is like this is like they're
definitely talking like they fired the
CEO, they fired the CPO, right?
&gt;&gt; I know. I just
&gt;&gt; you know, they got this stuff going on.
How do you do it? So, how like what are
what what's the other list, right? So,
like let's go through the alternatives.
&gt;&gt; I actually love it. I think it's great.
I think it alone without some kind of
acknowledgement is not great.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's been like a It's a good
point because there was like a press
release that then was like debunked and
people were like that's fake. You know,
here's the main thing. What I'll say,
Kelly, is like
I actually don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about us.
I don't care about Nolan, Kelly, whoever
is listening to this podcast, LinkedIn
X. You know what I care about are the
 
careers and time on this company who
have equity. And so like let's just make
like the only thing I care about is that
those people have somebody who like
jumped in right away and was like, I got
your back. This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. We don't
take stuff like this. we are going to
fix it and we're going to come out on
the other side even stronger than
before. Like that has to be true and
none of us know if that happened because
I'm sure that those people are getting
hit up by everybody in their mother and
not talking.
&gt;&gt; Now that I completely agree with and
I've been saying this whole segment is
the responsibility to those 300 people
&gt;&gt; is the most important thing and that
that was the the the the foundation of
everything that I've said. Y
&gt;&gt; now then we could talk about you know
consequences and ripple from this which
may suck for other CEOs other chief
people officers like I got a few jokes
like hey are you you know what I mean
like
&gt;&gt; oh my god I didn't even think about that
&gt;&gt; like that's kind of shitty because you
kind of piss in the lemonade for
everyone else a little bit you know I
mean if I'm a early career person and I
don't really know great seauite leaders
or I haven't worked with many people and
I see this like now it's kind of a
little bit of a an incline that you got
that might you know even if it's a joke
it's still a thing that's a good take
especially in the moment of you know two
weeks ago I went and saw like one of the
fastest growing companies in Utah and
the CEO told me they have deleted HR
that was his exact quote right u if you
look at the ex comments from when this
originally dropped a lot of what you
will see is from CEOs saying like this
is why I hate HR, right? Like it's all
this like moral authority grandstanding
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's rule. I said this, you
know, in one of my comments, but it's
like the thing that really pisses people
off is rules for thee but not for me.
&gt;&gt; And and so like I you're actually
totally right, Kelly, is that it kind of
like it adds fuel to the fire of what
people are already experiencing in this
job today. Yeah. I mean, one of someone
asked me like, "What what has been one
of the biggest challenges or focus areas
across your whole career?" And for 25
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] years, you know what? It's been
getting employees to trust me. Like,
convincing employees that I'm not that
HR person.
I mean, it's a hurdle that's usually
always been climbed, you know, and and
and cleared for for good reason, but
like that's this has not been helpful.
And on the other side, I looked at the
CEO's background. I was like, oh, you
know, here's the other um generalization
for you. Oh, this guy's he's been a C
he's a revenue officer by Chris sales
leader most of the time. So, that sucks
too, you know. So it's it's just again
your responsibility to people inside and
outside.
It's just shitty and selfish. So
&gt;&gt; what do you think's going to happen with
these people?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. But I again I told Hillary
multiple times I was like gh I almost
have empathy. Can you imagine the drive
home from that concert?
&gt;&gt; Damn, that sucks.
&gt;&gt; No, I actually don't think they realized
it on the drive home. I thought they was
going to be like oh like
&gt;&gt; you know I I don't think they were
really worried about it. Um, I can't
imagine, you know, the being the the
wife of the CEO who I saw everyone
comment on her Facebook. Um, like that's
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. That's brutal. You know,
that's the thing is like I do, you know,
we have we have basically ignored this
topic, but like two families are getting
ripped apart on this one. I feel for the
the other
uh the other spouses. I feel for the
kids. You know, that stuff is like super
super [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. I have a hard time
though, Kelly, thinking
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
these people can ever work and venture
again.
&gt;&gt; It's gonna be tough. I don't I don't We
always tell the truth on here. I don't
know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like part of me is like, well, do you
start your own thing then? But like you
can't do that because if you start your
own thing, you need more agency and
trust and credibility than you do being
inside. So I'm just not sure, Nolan.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just I I can't see it. Like I I
can see it maybe after like a full Mia
culpa and like owning and what went
wrong and you know like u you at this
point the I think the only path you have
&gt;&gt; is you just have to start telling the
truth.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You got to tell everybody what happened.
You got to put it all out there
&gt;&gt; because otherwise like why would
somebody ever want to work with you
again?
&gt;&gt; That's correct. Or work overseas. It's
another
option
&gt;&gt; I think. I think X still works over
there. Um,
but I could be wrong.
&gt;&gt; Anyways,
&gt;&gt; it's gonna be tough. It's gonna be
tough. So, uh, yeah, I'm glad we covered
it. It was good conversation.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one was fun. Uh, it's good to
see everybody, by the way. Uh, let us
know what you guys want to hear. Me and
Kelly going to be, uh, coming in with
all the hot takes soon. So, talk to you
guys soon. Peace.
