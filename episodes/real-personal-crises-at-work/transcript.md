what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics so Kelly
one of the reasons people love the show
is because we're transparent and we're
authentic and you know there's basically
no rules here so you know you're going
through something right now in your
personal life you want to quickly share
with the audience what's going on and
how you and your family are doing yeah
no totally I think this is really first
of all it's helpful to talk about it's
good you know um second we did start
this show to tell the truth and talk
about the hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and that's not just
about work it is when things happen in
life and a whole huge kind of wrecking
ball comes in and hits you from the side
and things just kind of scatter all over
the place you know so honestly Anan it
was crazy it was like four weeks to the
day was it was February 24th four weeks
ago I got a call that my mom was going
to the hospital 911 to her house because
she couldn't really walk was
malnourished was just kind of you know
not great and this is someone who is
like more intense than me right she
makes me look like Buddha she makes me
look like like literally Buddha um very
independent active all the things anyway
goes into sequa Hospital in Rood City
here in California has a a fractured
pelvis gets you know the X-ray fractured
pelvis like no wonder you can't you know
and then gets a CT scan and finds like a
 
they're like o this probably contributed
to the fracture if not a fall maybe both
ends up getting a CT of everywhere you
know two days later we're waiting to get
discharged oncologist walks in and
basically just drops a bomb that we've
got um
matized matized stage four lung cancer
that is now in four places this is
someone who's never smoked a day in her
life so you know what I mean it's just
kind of like boom and so all of a sudden
you have this infiltration in our family
you know Hillary myself the boys and
it's just like oh my God this just this
just took over and you just become numb
yeah and I mean you have a lot going on
right Kelly like you know these are the
things that you don't plan for yeah that
life just takes over right you're you're
running a you know you're running a
successful business you're doing a
fractional gig right now you're you're
meeting with me multiple times a week to
do this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then this thing
sideswipes you and you know like I don't
know I don't even know how you like
there is no like it's not even normal
anymore right like this is just like the
thing that you're now dealing with that
becomes priority number one yeah yeah
and I know a lot of us have had to deal
with it
um but yeah people asked even before
this like how do you you do all this
stuff anyway and you literally become
the parent like overnight do you know
what I mean like I'm literally the
parent of this person who I don't know
if she'll go home again you know dealing
emotionally trying to support them
because they're sad and feeling defeated
and everything like there's just a lot
to it and I'll tell everyone like you
all know this that has gone through it
the first few weeks I told no one
earlier those are like the easy weeks
like your adrenaline's going you're
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like taking care of stuff you're
going to the hospital you're moving
they're like I can do this and then
you're like oh man this is not stopping
this isn't like a this isn't like a
three-week Sprint and that hits you
right that hit me this week but but no
you've been through this too like what
do you do and and you
literally first of all you can't be like
like I got this all the time like you
can't stuff this and be strong all the
time like I had like four breakdowns I
was crying on the way home from work
last
week and that's all right I think
totally to have that and ask for that
repreve in those moments Friday Friday I
was like I'm not I'm not doing this I
canceled like four meetings explained
why it's incredible how people can help
you if you voice that yeah so I'll share
my story which I haven't shared before
but my uh you know my
father-in-law is like the best person it
was the best person ever and a couple
years ago it started with he was out in
Salt Lake and like this is like a cowb
like literal Cowboy right the hardest
dude I know like only works with his
hands and he was like feeling like
winded and this is somebody who wakes up
at 4:30 every morning starts working you
know he's the last person up he's also
partying with everybody until like the
last drink yeah and like what the hell's
going on with Kevin so anyways you know
they ended up putting in a pacemaker
while he was here like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like
you know Granddad is is a human it
sounds like because you think these
people are super human and you know come
to find out actually that was actually
just a symptom it was the the underlying
thing that was going on with him is this
very rare dise disease called
amidis it attacks your organs it was
attacking his heart we went through this
journey over two years uh to where we
got to the point to where he did he
needed a heart
transplant so anyways he got that yeah
and then fast forward to last December
he got sick
yeah and he passed
 
away so you know these are the things
that happen that like when you
experience them you're like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
like you know when you get to this point
to where your parents get old enough to
where they can pass it hits you so much
differently than when you're younger in
life and you know some people go through
this earlier in life um and they have a
lot more empathy but this is kind of one
of those situations to where until you
really experience it yeah it's hard to
have that empathy and so I always think
about now you just never know what
people are going through yeah you just
never know and we especially people like
CL Kelly like we're High Achievers you
know we and we're both by the way we're
both like crying on the show right now
so just want like noan and I are the
most hardass people we're like crying on
the show but you are completely correct
um and I I've tried to be better about
that in the past like five years you
know a few years is you don't know
what's going on it doesn't have to be a
parent dying or can it could be a little
thing but someone could be really
struggling I mean we're all struggling
in some way um and
so I don't know I've just tried to be a
little bit Kinder kind of assuming good
intent um which can be hard to do
especially in this industry in this area
and that's why I love what we do because
people are human like I I every time I
go into work or talk to someone they
could be the biggest jerk leader but
they're sad about something or they're
struggling with something
and um it's been it's
been really helpful and I think the
other thing that I've you know learned
is it's actually okay not to have a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] answer
or a positive comment like sometimes it
just sucks and
it is what it is and you do the best you
can doesn't always have to be the
best amen sister and you know it turns
out that you can't compartmentalize life
right and so I you know when my dad I
remember when my dad used to like get
home you know he'd like he'd try to like
take off his work hat and like put on
his dad hat and it just doesn't work
that way like life doesn't work that way
and so you know the lessons for me is is
number one
who you work with the people you work
with every day like me and you doing the
show right Kelly like every like we're
making a choice to spend more time with
each other and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love hanging
out with you and like that's it's super
important to me is like we you and I go
through life together these things come
up and like I have your back you have my
back we're checking in on each other
like it's so important to have that yeah
at work in in fact I think it's like
more important than anything else that's
going on right is like that people who
you work with have your back because you
can't just take your hat off of like
okay like I'm dealing with this thing at
home now I go into work and like put my
work hat on and like get really
performative it just doesn't work that
way like you need to have people that
care about you and then you know the
other big one is just we just never know
what's going on with someone and you
know one of the things that I learned
from my friend Jessica alter that she
she was like a master at this she would
just be like you know when something was
like when someone was like really
emotional or something like that she'd
give them a little bit of space and then
she'd call them and just be like hey is
is everything everything
okay and just asking somebody that
question I find is like it just lowers
the waterline you know people can share
about what's actually going on with them
and when you better understand the
holistic picture of somebody's life you
know then you can figure out the best
ways to work with them and to move the
business forward obviously we all care
about those things but first and
foremost we're
human yeah for sure and and just the
speed at which that can happen to
someone do you know what I mean like I
feel like my life just like it it was
nuts it changed literally within 12
hours like forever so yeah that kind of
stuff is surreal um it's also you know
you try to
find the good things right you
appreciate life a little bit more you
get you as these things happen to us we
get older kids parent whatever it is it
could be a pet it could be a friend you
just you gain perspective
um and you just you're not as much of as
a punk anymore hopefully you know what I
mean like that's so true you're just not
a p you're just like you get wiser you
get you can help people more you can
help coach people more that are little
punk still because we all were um it's
just it's just how it goes it's yeah the
coaching thing so I'll tell another so
you know we're going through this stuff
and it's my father-in-law right you know
we named my son after him and it's my
wife's hero and so we're going through
this stuff right before he passed away
and I was working with Steve schlafman
who's an awesome coach um but I think
this is more of like a like a segment of
like you should have a coach like if the
world's best athletes have coaches like
you should have one too and so I was
working with Steve and I was like dude I
don't know what to do like I'm running
this company right now I'm struggling
there you know I don't know how to
support my wife I don't know how to
support my father-in-law like I don't
know what to do and he asked this really
powerful question he goes well what
would your father-in-law
want and
it just became super clear to me because
like you know he's a grinder too but
like yeah you know he needs his baby
girl which is do everything I can to
make sure Ashley can be there yep and I
handle I handle the house I handle the
business you know I handle everything
else but like I never would have gotten
there on my own and that was the the the
big learning for me is like I was so
discombobulated you know like my brain
was and I'm sure you're feeling this
right now it's like you know you have
all these responsibilities
you've pre-committed yourself to a
million fcking things and now this thing
happens and it it has to take priority
but like you got to figure out what is
the most important thing and that that
does especially in times like this it
changes all the time yeah and I think
you know again the first three weeks
you're just on adrenaline you know so
you you are just kind of doing all the
things and then you kind of collapse and
you you you you kind of stop and you
break down which happened last week so
now so now what do you do you're like
okay how do I how do I not do what I did
last week and how do I not do what I did
the first three weeks so it's like what
are you how this new
normal is I can't spread myself
everywhere um first of all if you have a
support system use them and if you don't
really have one try to get one you know
Hillary my wife and my friends like and
if you are a support system from someone
don't ask them what you can do just do
it exactly like never never just never
ask them just do um
because it's just so I that's like one
of my biggest learnings is I will never
ask someone how I can help them anymore
I'm just gonna like decide how I'm going
to help them and do it just like so it's
one less thing to like think about is
answer too many decisions too many
decisions too many decisions and that's
what happened to me last week I think it
was 400 p.m. I was at Quizlet and um I
just kind of like you know you know that
witching hour anyway and I just kind of
shut my laptop the brain shut off I was
like just staring at the conference room
wall and I had eight things going on and
that was the breakdown day where i'm
like okay I can't actually hold all of
this so now I'm trying to not try to do
everything at once try to do the things
that need to be done quality and kind of
rotate them a little bit more and that's
it's the only way to survive man I mean
we are human to your point yeah I used
to get really awkward when something
like this would happen to someone else
and part of the reason why is because I
hadn't like really experienced it and
then when I did I had the exact same
learning like my wife and I had the
exact same learning which is like don't
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ask me what you can do just like
do something or don't ping me it's like
another to do we just have you know we
got two kids you know we got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
jobs we got so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on and
then we got this you know this Family
Health crisis which all of us will
ultimately end up dealing with some way
shape or form and so I I learned from my
neighbor my neighbors just rock and
they're just like you know they're
they're old school people like they're
not on Twitter and social media and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
yeah but they're just humans and they
connect with humans and so you know what
my neighbor Sue did is she she literally
like she got all the neighbors together
and was like we're going to take care of
dinner for the next week um yeah you
know just tell us if you have any food
allergies otherwise we're handling the
menu and it's just going to show up at
this time is that time okay for you I
love it
it like the best you know what I mean
it's just like the best and it's just
it's one less thing to worry about right
so like that now the thing I do like my
you know the the lever I'm always
pulling in these situations is just like
hey we got dinner for you tonight one
less thing for you to worry about here's
a door Dash gift card have your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
kids place the order enjoy it we love it

um the last thing I'll say just on a
lighter note well kind of a lighter note
but I have learned so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] much in
like the last four weeks about the
health system about this about insurance
about key phrases to say at the hospital
about long-term Health Care insurance uh
Power of attorneys this and that if you
have any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] questions on this I am
like an MBA on this now in four well
don't ping her now yeah don't ping her
now yeah please don't ping me now in
four weeks it has been incredible what
we you know have learned about this um
and a lot of us in Tech a lot of us that
are moving fast a lot of us that are
high Achievers that's like the last
thing that we think about and I'm like
do not put that last like take care of
that
because it's a big stress so you know on
the on the like healthcare learning
thing is like what we learned is that
you you need an
advocate who is there and on all the
time
who is at your IQ level right cuz like
cuz if so you know say what you know
this is what we what happened is that
you know doctor would come in uh talk to
Dad Mom would be in there you know mom's
super emotional she's like going through
a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now she's trying
to think about like her life and Doctor
like says something of like this is what
we're going to do as the next step and
Mom's just like great like let's do it
and then so then we get the call and I'm
like hold on a goddamn minute like what
about these five things right how are we
thinking about those how are the you
have to advocate for yourself you know
we live in the US I think candidly this
is probably now global issue is like
sometimes questions we ask they haven't
thought
of and like this is where chat ubt like
I'm putting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything through
chat gbt now for my own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right like
I get blood drawn I throw it through
chat gbt and I say like hey this is how
I've been feeling this is what's going
on with me what do you think like what's
going on here and so like it takes time
and bandwidth that you otherwise don't
have though and so that that's when I
went through like my regret minimization
framework and like what am I going to
regret later on in life was like I need
to free up my wife she needs to just be
she was there for three weeks and it's
just you need to be there you need to be
at the hospital right with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on
at work call me like I will help you
navigate that and figure out like who we
can delegate to and like I'll be your
coach in that way but like she needed to
be there to advocate for her dad yep yep
yeah the the the piece of mind mind with
the ability to focus whatever that is at
that moment has been extremely
helpful um versus you know trying to
take a meeting at the hospital and all
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like it's just crazy and
yeah so I appreciate talking about this
I I I think um you know for a couple
reasons one this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens it doesn't
have to be this you know intense but
small stuff big stuff happens all the
time and we have to talk about it
because it impacts us
it impacts how you show up at work it
impacts what you think is important uh
and I don't think it's talked about
enough and I I think we're we're getting
somewhere with it but I appreciate us
talking about this yeah I appreciate it
too Kelly last thing I'll leave the
audience with is if you're on the the
other side of this to where you're
working with somebody who's going
through something you know one of the
things that my the language my wife and
I used was like do you want work to be a
distraction now or do you just need to
have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clear space like just
asking that question at the outset right
before drop the work question in yeah
right is super super helpful for people
because like you know sometimes they
want a distraction like we found that
like you know a couple weeks after he
had passed was like I need to get my
mind off of this like I need to start
doing like other things and that was
really helpful but then there was like
moments where it's like hey I just need
like a little bit of Blank Space right
now because like I'm going through some
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah so yeah Kelly I love you I'm
sorry you're going through this but I
want you to know that I have your back
you have a big community of people that
love you and I'm praying for your mom
yeah thanks everyone we'll get through
it
together I must admit I used to believe
that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR that is until my friend
Heather do who leads talented signal
fire told me to check out metav I got
into the product and was like Wow AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruited their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metav view changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with with all your existing
tools and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up join Talent leaders at
organizations like brex deal hellofresh
and quora and check out medavie head
