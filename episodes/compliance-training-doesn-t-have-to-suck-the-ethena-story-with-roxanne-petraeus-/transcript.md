all right hi everyone how you guys doing
good to be back with you all Nolan and I
are really looking forward to this
session today and we snagged roxan
Petraeus who's the CEO of Athena to come
on with us today her background is
incredible she's been a two-time Founder
former arm
in the Army and her father was a captain
in the Air Force and her father-in-law
is a four-star general from what I just
was educated on before the show so And
to clarify I didn't educate you I don't
I don't lead with no I did I'm a fanboy
I'm I'm I'm like the Fanboy uh no one
loves to think he educates me on a lot
of items so that that's just part for
the
course and the Army was on my list for
today so we're going to go into that
because your background your experience
in the Army I'm assuming you know was
very influential and who you are as a
leader and a founder and I am a adviser
for Athena with you all working with you
all for a while it's a great product we
use it at Quizlet where I'm a interim
and yeah all inone compliance training
platform and would love to dig in with
how you got there how you built it all
the things as you've been there for
almost six years as the CEO so without
further Ado I'd love to jump in the Army
stories here so tell us kind of how that
how that started I'm assuming it was
family influenced totally thank you so
much for having me on I'm excited to
start with the Army it's always a fun
Blast from the Past because it feels
very different to my daytoday life now
where I like get a latte and like
everything is Chill I live in Brooklyn
but that world was not chill so they
don't serve They don't serve lattes in
the army they don't and they did not
appreciate my love of oat milk the story
of how I ended up there is I got into
college and my dad who was in the Air
Force was like congratulations how are
you going to pay for it and you know in
family lore we had this epic screaming
match I was like what are you talking
about how are you going to pay for it
and turns out he held the cards and so I
kind of researched and had a family
friend who had done RC Reserve officer
training course so essentially the army
or um uh any branch will pay for college
exchange for about four years of active
duty service afterward and I figured I
didn't have anything else planned on my
great career Journey both my dad and my
mom were in the military for a little
bit of time so I had had at least some
exposure which is pretty common because
now there's quite a civil military
divide where most people who are in the
military sort of have some connection to
the military which I think is a little
bit unfortunate because I think it's
it's good to um had a w wider dialogue
but neither here nor there um and so
yeah so I ended up uh in the Army
because I straight up needed money for
college but I stayed in the Army because
I found that it was just full of people
who I wanted to be like when I grew up I
just thought they were like really good
leaders and really
impressive and I think you know to the
extent any 18-year-old knows what they
want to be when they grow up like I
didn't really think that much about the
career aspects of it but I was just
really impressed with a lot of people
and I thought this is a place that I
will like be better when I exit it
because of the sort of hard stuff that
I'm going to go through so how does one
go from like you know the Army to
McKenzie to like you know founder of a
venture back tech company that's
building in like the HR compliance space
yeah I think there's in some ways a
through line and then in other ways it's
random whenever I talk to like the youth
the youngsters the youth and they ask
for career advice I'm usually just like
don't think about it that hard and go
work with really good people like
wherever you can find the best people go
work with them because I think it's a
bit hard at least I have found to like
perfectly map about my career like I
wouldn't have been like I'm going to be
in the Army and then co-found a company
in the like healthy meal delivery space
and then go to Mackenzie and then
co-found Athena like that was not my you
know sort of 15-year plan but I think in
all of those places I was just I've
always been really interested in
leadership like how you become a good
leader how you build good culture like
I've just always found that interesting
and so I think that to the extent there
is sort of adding through line I think
that is it got it and then what was the
insight for Athena the insight for
Athena percolated for a long time much
like my lattes and then was like a quick
thing so the percolating for a long time
so in the Army which is I think when I
was in was call it 10 to 15% women and
certain parts of the army were close to
women when I joined the many of them had
since opened up and so candal I just
like saw a lot of issues with uh topics
like sexual harassment and I took a lot
of training compliance training that it
was just sort of openly referred in the
Army to check the box training now
thought like wow it's kind of a miss
that I'm taking this training that is
terrible like truly a joke like soldiers
would kind of make like really
inappropriate jokes because the training
was so bad it was pretty hard to take
seriously and yet I would walk out of
the training and be like well there's a
scenario there's a scenario there's a
scenario so that was just like in the
back of my head in particular because I
actually found that when you worked with
soldiers um and officers they were um by
and large like really good people who
wanted to do the right thing they didn't
want to be jerks they wanted the best
out of their whole teams but this
training just like totally didn't
reflect that and instead felt very
stuffy and very legal and very like it
made women seem scary because they might
report you at any moment and then when I
got out of the army and I was at
McKenzie I was just surprised because it
was sort of an era where Mckenzie was in
the from page of the New York Times
pretty frequently for like ethics issues
bribery opioid related work and I was
taking MacKenzie's risk training while
like you know toggling to the New York
Times and reading about these sort of
allegations that like just looked really
bad and I thought like huh I'm taking
this training that's telling me about
ethics but I don't feel any more
equipped to like handle an ethical
situation if I came across one at
Mackenzie and furthermore this is like
you know one of the Premier institutions
for corporate learning like if anyone is
going to have good compliance training
good risk training good do the right
thing training it's going to be
Mackenzie and they don't have it and so
I went and talked to a mentor there and
basically said like hey I've got this
idea for a startup and he was like yeah
cool all Angel invest just leave it
seems like you kind of want to do that
you're not you don't see that into this
and like I think that's just a better
fit and so that's the long and the short
of fit I mean so roxan and I talked I
think the first time we chatted I was
definitely not advisor and I wasn't
until a year and a half after I we
talked I think and and that was probably
three years ago and something like that
maybe two years ago and you were asking
me like hey what what's it like out
there how's training work L ms's and I
was like I can't stand lm's and usually
I can't stand L &amp; D it's a whole thing I
do remember this take I slacked my
co-founder right after our conversation
yeah yeah I just feel and I still feel
really strongly about I was talking to
someone yesterday about it and I'd love
to get both your takes on on what's
changing with that because I loved how
you started Athena based on it being
terrible and kind of all these things
and I I get questions like should we
have an L&amp;D function what is it even
anymore what systems do you use what
what how does it work and I just love to
talk about that because I think that
infuses into how you all built Athena
and work with your clients totally yeah
H I can start but like happy to Rift
like take challenges all of it okay so
this is all credit to my co-founder in
the very beginning she had this very
strong perspective that training is top
down so as a company Quizlet I tell
everyone you need to take Craftsman
prevention and code of conduct and cyber
security training learning is bottom up
I want to become better at communicating
I want to be better at one-on ones it's
like Discovery based and it sort of
requires that and so we have built our
LMS our learning management system all
of our Tech optimized for the top down
kind of approach that means things like
tracking
assignments um reporting so if you have
an auditor and you need to show that
like Nolan took this cyber security
training at this time you can do that
that is very different than I think what
an ideal learning solution would be
because that needs to Encompass a ton
more use cases like compliance by
definition is regulated um you need to
take largely the same training with the
exception of State differences or
whatever um but learning is like we're
all on our own different journey and
like the leadership training I need is
really different than the leadership
training that Melanie or CPO needs not
just because we're in different
functions but because we're like
different humans with different
strengths and an and I thought I don't
think we can build a system that really
does that like that Technic seems if not
impossible like I don't know it just but
we're like what we can do is like really
optimize for the compliance case
especially because we've since branched
out into also having HR case management
which we can talk about so it's like a
whole different platform if you ask me
as like CEO me like Rex what's your
learning strategy at Athena I'd be like
well it's certainly not an
enterprise-wide LMS where I make
everyone take the same how to be better
at Excel training and I'd go so far as
to say if Melanie our wonderful Chief
people officer pitched me on something
like this I'd be like that is
fundamentally misguided because I think
at least at a company like ours we're
really relying on people to learn in
like a bunch of different ways so I
expect you to listen to podcasts like
this one a side note or Melanie and I
have a podcast you should listen to that
too um or um I expect you to talk to
your peers I expect you to try stuff out
if like we have someone going out on mat
Le raise your hand and like do some of
their job and that's how you're going to
learn and I don't think that Lear
learning is just going to happen because
you took a 45 minute e learning course
on like typ difficult conversations yeah
Nolan what do you think I always think
about starting with like what is the
problem we're
solving and I think you can get really
deep into this like well we want to
upskill our employees and we want to
make sure that they continue to learn
here and then basically what I've seen
every single time is it like devolves
into this well let's just do what
they're doing thing and we skip all
these other steps and go copy like what
it
exists I actually think this is like one
of the most challenging problems to
solve especially in the era of AI and
how fast companies are changing and how
fast the expectations companies have of
employees are
changing I feel like my current take
which I would love disagreement on is I
kind of feel like it's up to the
employee like there should be resources
for the company that the company can
offer
but it you know like who I'm never going
to be the person who's like oh let me go
click on like the Excel training and go
do that like it never shows up that way
it always shows up as like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like
I have this Gap I need to solve it let
me do some of like I should first as
employee do my own research on how I can
solve that for free then if I need to
keep keep getting more learning in that
area then what I should do is go to my
manager get some feedback from them on
what I should be doing like triangulate
on this thing and maybe it's like a
one-off class that you go take maybe
it's like we get you a coach I just feel
like we're trying to do these peanut
butter
approaches because that's what we've
always done and it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] approach but
also the reason why peanut butter feels
good is because it's equal right right
and everyone has access to that it's
also very easy I feel like if you're
like tomorrow make a learning strategy
and you're like I gave everybody access
to X course Library that's like pretty
easy from an implementation exactly from
an implementation perspective if you're
like did they learn um you know then
it's like that's actually really
complicated to identify the skill gaps
I'm trying to solve like I I mean I have
sympathy for people because that problem
is much
harder but I think I tend to agree that
like an organic and employee driven
approach is best I think Melanie like we
have an amazing relationship with think
sh Rock I think one of the areas where
we tend to like approach things
differently is I usually have a little
bit more of a like Sinker swim folks and
she has more of a hey we need to lay the
foundation and make sure that people
know about this and have access and Etc
and I think maybe the answerers sort of
both are true like your best employees
are always going to succeed in a sink or
swim sort of world but especially as a
company scales like I think it's pretty
hard to you know and I mean like maybe
AI will change this and every company
will have only 20 employees and they'll
be this incredible team of truly only a
talent but I think as I talked to most
companies when they get like I don't
know past like five 00 employees or so
in their most honest moments they're
like not everybody is like an a player
because that's like pretty hard to you
know maintain that bar for Quality when
you're also going for quantity and there
I think it becomes more important to
have this idea of like okay but what are
our ways that we bring up the sort of
average employee you know yeah look I
agree with all of that um I guess the
thing that I don't agree with is much is
if you leave it all up to the employee
let's just be honest most of us most
most of them will be like I'm not going
to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do this I don't want to do it
so I do think there are things that the
employer does need to identify it's kind
of like kids like you don't think you
need this but you need it I think the
trick is what I've been so annoyed about
with this stuff is that is true you
don't think you need this but you you're
going to need this or we want you to be
good at this because it's going to come
um or whatnot is then they use a one-
siiz fits-all blanket peanut butter
check the box thing so okay they've done
it all but nothing really sunk in
because it was exactly what you both
said and let's be honest too when we're
taking that stuff like we're kind of
paying attention not really paying so
I'm starting to think that no matter
what it is whether it's like compliance
stuff or sexual harassment stuff or even
like self-actualizing things like
leadership development and things like
that the best thing we can do is somehow
make
it like relevant to their day-to-day
like the it's like the the old thing
around Dei which I still believe the
more you can make it a part of like the
natural flow of the business the more
people will take away from it and
probably lean into it you know what I
mean so if you had yeah compliance
training but if you followed it up with
like real talk about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that happened
to people and what they did and like you
kind of hit people in a different lens
versus multiple choice did you retain
this like fake scenario I just think it
falls in line better so that that's kind
of my headline is as much as you can
make this stuff real and a part of your
business like I told somebody yesterday
we're not having an L&amp;D like group we're
not having a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] L &amp;d person we this
is L &amp;d like me sitting down with this
manager talking through how to look at
comp for their whole team in a way that
like they are so invested or scared
about or anxious about it will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
remember things like that is L &amp;d to me
so I just and I do think unless you're
lazy and like let's check the box you
can apply that to big stuff and like
legally compliant stuff which is the
empet of how you and I talked about this
three years
ago hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview and
I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards metav view changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than three minutes to set
up join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out metav head over to metav view.
a/h Heretics to talk to one of Met's
product experts tell them that me and
Kelly sent you or you could just go to
their website and get started for free
you'll be up running and AI enabled in
minutes let me submit this for you guys
I think the best L &amp;d is number one a
great
manager and then number two special
treatment for top
performers I think on the first one I
buy it in that like Kelly s you said
actually made me think about Dei so like
you know I think siloed approaches don't
work right right so if you're like this
is our Dei function and then here's
sales and engineering and you're like oh
so only the Dei function is diverse I
think like L &amp;d would be kind of similar
of like I think it should be everyone's
job and not said in a way of like I give
lip service to that but then that
basically means like no one needs to do
it but like sales I spend a ton of time
with their sales see like love sales
love hanging out um in that world and
like sales training to me like Kelly so
how you framed it of like um hey this is
a waste of my time I would argue if a AE
thinks that our sales trading is a waste
of their time get out of that sales
trading go Prospect go let's see your
great win weight hot shot and like
amazing and I think it's the job of the
manager and allte your point to make
sure that is not a waste of time because
otherwise literally what are we doing
everybody go leave and do something else
compliance is a little trickier I always
love no one has taken me up on this but
I I think a really Innovative um
approach would be making it um optional
but then if you mess up like you
employee are super duper screwed because
you didn't even think that you needed to
learn you know how to handle a
reasonable accommodation request and
turns out you did it disastrously I
understand all the reasons that
companies are like no thank you I will
be giving this to everybody um and I
think that's probably smarter especially
as you scale but I still agree that the
same principle holds which is like you
know whatever sugar over medicine or
something like like at least dress it up
make it sort of um customize it so it's
like oh this is actually relevant
because I often think when an employee
says this is a waste of my time I'm
really interested in digging in more I
is it because if it actually is let's
get you out of here I was that annoying
person in the Army where I was like this
is a waste of my time why do I need to
be here for this or that and I think
there was something to it you know which
is okay maybe I could you know maybe
I've already got this can I test out
like stuff like that but anyway so noan
I agree with your first point second one
I think I agree with too because you
want your fast performers to just like
run like I just want like run like um
yeah exactly right and then the sub
bullet of the second point is I feel
like those people help pull up everyone
else in the
orc right and so it's like if we can
keep giving these people I had an old
manager who had this philosophy around
surprise and delight and you know I came
in as like the smartass kid who was like
well how does that scale Keith and he's
like well it does it
Nolan and it's and like some things just
don't scale well right and you just have
to have the intellectual nimbleness to
be okay with that and I find that as
company scale there's this pressure
that's applied to like what is our L&amp;D
program like we must have this codified
and documented and I'm just like I don't
know have dope managers and give the a
players everything they need to be
successful and that like things just
work yeah I mean to be blunt I haven't
taken aside from compliance which I this
is why like my distinction between
training versus learning I think is
different but so I've taken my
compliance training every year um but I
have not not taking an e-learning
class in I don't know like literally
never yeah yet I think I have learned so
much since running Athena as an example
I learn because my co-founder educates
me on how to build great products or
Melanie explains to me what the hell of
pip is and I'm like oh fascinating like
didn't know and so like yeah I think if
you have really good people that is your
learning strategy because they are
talking to each other and building and
you can just learn I think probably your
point I'm like kids I'm I'm a mom of two
I don't know if you've noticed the
incredible artwork it's not available in
stores this is my sons um and I think
that learning can happen when they ask
me like if you're 150 do you die and
it's like that's learning moment to talk
about like mortality you know yeah and
they actually want to hear about it like
you're not like let me tell you about
this and they're like I I don't I don't
want to know about this exactly if I sat
down and was like today here's your
workbook like well that's not what I was
interested in inexplicably I'm
interested in death and dogs right now
and like okay cool let's talk about that
yeah like I was going to sit down La
last night I'm like listen you're going
to learn about rental property investing
it's very important it's interesting and
they're like we don't want to we don't
want to do that right now I'm like all
right I'm not going to waste an hour and
have you retain like 8% of this I'll
wait until you're older and you want to
make some cash and learn how this works
and then you're going to listen right
which is I think my distinction of top
down top down is training like I'm going
to tell my kids like if you're lost look
for a police officer or something I
don't care if you want to learn that or
not I'm going to tell you that but
bottom up is learning and that's like
them expressing curiosity and like you
know whatever how waterfall Works unless
you all have something else I'd love to
Pivot a little bit roxan because you
mentioned you know Mel a few times your
Chief people officer and whatnot and I
just you know we've had Mel on the show
multiple times she's a friend of ours
she's a celebrity she's a celebrity and
you know she's been really open like you
didn't really know what a CPO was or did
and make sense I mean hell you didn't
even know what a pip was you just said
which is fine because no one likes still
honestly still figuring that you don't
need to no no one likes them anymore we
don't have them so it's kind of fine
good exactly so what was it like kind of
having a CPO for the first time within
an HR tech company right like you you
not just have an HR person you got a
salesp person a product person a
marketing person did you have a vision
for this job when you were looking for
Mel or hired Mel how was that Journey as
a Founder I think vaguely and we knew it
was my co-founder an I knew it was an
important role for us cuz exactly to
your point we're sort of HR tech for our
kind of midmarket customer legal Tech is
usually legal is who we sell into um our
market so we knew this was like a role
we had to get right also I think
interestingly I had thought very little
about HR but we thought about culture
like from Day Zero so for example we
were obsessed with bu the advantage by
lenion we had um when we were like small
had like book clubs had everyone read it
because our VP of engineering came from
a company that was really into it and he
kind of pitched us on how important it
was and I totally bought I still buy it
I'm like single most valuable sort of
thing that we did early on so I didn't
really understand HR but I understood
culture and talent I've been obsessed
with Netflix's like Talent memo and
their approach and I love like no rules
rules and I think that like them as a
company have like really impressed me
and in terms of how they Implement High
Talent density and freedom and
responsibility so I didn't understand
and have a really Clear Vision of HR but
I think I had a sense of like I hope she
makes our culture good was like my my
profound like initial thoughts but
Melanie was kind of not like what does
that mean in your mind I hope they make
my culture good what's important to you
as a Founder what are the things and
maybe like totally I think to amend it
slightly I think this is maybe cocky but
it's more like maybe I hope she
maintains it cuz I thought by the time
we had hired Melanie we had the seeds of
a really good culture so for me and I
get to be selfish because I'm CEO so I'm
in charge um the culture that I think is
good is the culture I want to work at
it's not the culture everyone wants to
work at and I totally get that um so for
us I think it tends to be like a lot of
very curious nerds like that's the kind
of culture I like so I don't like high
ego I don't like a lot of posturing and
let I've talked about this I find that
as a woman I'm like always a little
uncomfortable saying this as boldly as I
might as a dude Nolan feel free to opine
on this or not I don't know so we have a
bunch of really smart people you know
intellectual horsepower that is like
very there I tend to not leave with that
I'm like I'm funny and like a leader and
kind of more of a jock but like at our
heart and my co-founder like brilliant
um I think we're people who really value
bringing intellectual horsepower to a
problem and problem solving and also
bringing grit and so to me a culture is
that like keeps that so for example and
like why I'm obsessed with um the lenion
stuff I want um a leadership team that
is smart enough that uh the designer can
critique the marketer the marketer can
tell product that they think that like
their road map doesn't make sense but
everyone can walk out of that discussion
not feeling like that was political or
yucky or whatever it was like oh that
was fun and interesting so anyway long
with way of saying that's what it it's
more the feel not necessarily the and
like note I did not mention yoga
benefits or like Ping Pong Tes because I
don't care about what you just described
as an idea of meritocracy right uh
that's Dio's thing yeah exactly that's
like what and I love it and I think like
in particular I love it and this is also
probably informed by who I am in my
co-founders but like we're women in our
 
ideas can come hot take from my house
and I don't want to commute into New
York City I don't and so I'm not going
to make anyone else commun to New York
City because my kid's going to get
norovirus and the nanny's going to be
sick and blah blah blah and I think I
can be incredibly effective but I like
can't um I I just like the trade-off for
me is like not worth it I won't do it
and I don't think that means I need to
be like put out to pasture as a woman
that had like nothing else to offer the
workplace and so that's another like key
component of our culture is we've just
been really honest about like we are a
remote first company and if you do not
like that you should probably not come
to us because that is not changing yeah
we talk a lot about being clear about
who you are less about what the answer
is more about Clarity and consistency of
of that because I think like Hunter
Hunter walk says this like you know a
good culture should be like not for
everybody because it should be clear you
know yeah and you said something before
we end this you said something me
because I this might be contentious or
we might argue which would be really fun
but you said I hope Mel kind of creates
a good culture or maintains a good
culture I tell HR folks you know if the
job description says this person's going
to own our culture to to run the other
direction I agree I agree I own our
culture cuz I said that I was hoping for
a fight Rock sorry we can I'm sure we
can find something to fight about this
will not be it I think I've been shocked
to learn in particular in Tech I think
like Cult of the founder and stuff how
much like power Ann and I have like we
just set the DNA so early not even
necessarily intentionally like we have
this joke Ann always says J so I'm G to
take this document I'm J it I've never
said Z before joining this company and
now I everything um and that's a like
silly superficial example but I think a
lot like Ann and I are kind of like
deeply humble but massive nerds and that
has been like baked into the DNA and
then it kind of perpetuates for a bunch
of different reasons so roxan there's
this narrative right now online amongst
Chief people officers in this like I
will describe as kind of like a crying
to each other thing that the role has
gotten too big like I keep seeing this
and it's driving me insane and so
actually I think like the CPO with the
biggest role that I know is yours and
the reason why is because not only does
she have to serve as cheap people
officer she's also kind of like one of
your biggest marketers probably like
somebody who's like helping close deals
all the time like she owns more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at
a tech company for a CPO than any other
CPO I know do you have a take that
sounds right right but like one is like
I you know I know Mel we're homies she
loves her job right she's like hope so
well this is the truth at least when she
she lies to me maybe I don't know yeah
great good as long as she's lying to
herself that's like really the most but
she's she's like I love my job right
like I'm having I think she does like
where is the dissonance right where is
the dissonance between this online
discourse going on which is like too
much why do people think that it's too
much like what has been added or what so
the things I'm seeing right Kelly maybe
you can chime in on this is like
RTO uh we had to deal with all the stuff
like with George Floyd don't do
it office um like all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that it
feels like is like well I don't want to
deal with it like let my CPO deal with
it which is actually what I think is
going on and I think there's also
misalignment with what the role should
be on the way in and then it's like you
just start taking on more and then it's
like you basically just become like the
dumpster for no one else wants to deal
with that's like you go do it or or they
don't know how to deal with it because
it's complex and high stakes and
uncomfortable and so they just kind of
but Kelly you've seen this discussion
online right of course uh the CEO or the
SE Suite team it depends but like I I
look at rockan and Mel I'm like Mel has
like the biggest CPO job in Tech because
she's part of the go to market
team yeah okay so I think and like I C
all this like still don't totally
understand HR which I think has actually
made me be like here is how I think it
should work at our company because like
as another thing I'm really curious
about like what's the distinction
between a CPO and a COO if a CPO in my
mind is doing what a CPO should be doing
but we can kind of get to um I don't
know if that's a very spicy take because
I don't understand the um things
so Melanie actually has a very small
team right like there's not that many
people in HR which I think is true in
most companies like your HR or is
smaller than your sales work it's
smaller than than your engineering work
or whatever so I think that an effective
CPO in my mind like if we take an
example of RTO I'm like how could you
possibly designate that to the CPO
because guess what they only have like I
don't know 15 employees or whatever so
it's like yeah you could be like all of
you guys better be in the office but
it's like you got to get the sales team
into the office that's who the CEO cares
about or the um engineering team or
whatever I think how Melanie is able to
do stuff is she realizes that her job is
not um she's not actually in charge of
very many people so what she has to do
is like work
with the head of sales work with the
head of engineering and get them to
implement the stuff that like they need
to implement and if they're not going to
do it Melanie's kind of like I don't
know what to tell you xan like Matt
won't you know um whatever change this B
difference with our wew work policy or
whatever but I'm not actually expecting
Melanie to do everything because that
would be ridiculous because then
everyone would need to like the
reporting or doesn't support
that right so I just like hold my VP is
quite responsible if my VP of sales is
like our AES aren't very good and I'm
having performance issues that's a
Melanie problem it' be like oh no that's
that's a you problem and then the same
happens with hiring right the same
happens with hiring that's a recruiting
problem versus right when we at the very
beginning of our company it took us a
minute to figure out hiring Engineers we
had like some misfires and you know
whatever this happens and we weren't I
guess it was actually a premale but it
would be true if B H been there an and I
weren't like boy what's wrong with HR
what's wrong with our talent processes
it was like this is an engineering
problem that like engineering needs to
figure out yeah and I guess like if
you're in that situation
though I think what the thing to say is
like who is the dri who is the directly
responsible individual here because I
think that's what's going on because I
think like very few PE I think CEOs
would say that HR is responsible for AE
is hitting quota attainment right they'
say like that's a Sales Management
problem so I think if you just keep
having that discussion it will become
clear that cuz if you're CPO is in
charge of that guess what your CPO would
make a lot more like that's how that
would work yeah well I mean you talked
to a lot of Founders and CEOs Ro saying
clearly and your circles like most a lot
of them do put the blame on the HR team
or this or that or clean this up like
have you had those conversations Kelly
I'll like say spicy I don't know spicy
I'll say I actually think they're just
not thinking about their HR person that
much and they're not really putting
blame like I don't hear a lot of founder
chatter that's like I hear founder
chatter that's like trying to figure out
what product team isn't shipping stuff
fast enough and like is my product team
leadership good and I hear like sales
and I hear marketing I got a BPM
marketing is not performing that's not
me sing at my PP marketing rocks but I
hear very little founder chatter around
HR
leadership and let's talk about that cuz
I I do have a belief that
um they usually don't talk about it
unless stuff blows up or hits the fan
it's viewed a bit frequently like an
administrative function which I think is
a Miss because like kind of what I've
told Melanie is like I don't really need
any leader or leadership sort of table
if they're not a business leader you
know like if it's truly an
administrative function you can have
yeah there's like a bunch of other ways
to handle that it's such an interesting
role like I've been in CPO roles where
you're one of the most influential
people in the company because you're
talking to the founder CEO you you have
excellent kind of ideas or observations
or wisdom that they just can't discern
in their dayto day and I do believe that
I think that's when it's done right yeah
yeah but I also yes and I'm learning not
to say but so that's that's when it's
that yeah that's when it's it's a better
life just take butt out of your life um
yeah that's when it's done really well
and that's the stuff that you're not
going to go to a 10x CEO group and be
like here's what happened my people
leader is so great that they helped me
see through the graay like I would
disagree I think I would say like my CPO
H so like I also am curious about the
distinction between CPO and a really
great executive coach because I think
when done right a CPO can be like a
really great executive coach I recently
and I worked with a amazing one early on
an and I did and then I recently started
working with a new one and I think she's
phenomenal her name's
Luca and Lucinda helps me solve my
hardest problems like that's why I pay
her a lot of money is like to solve my
hardest problems and my hardest problems
are strategic like are we allocating our
resources correctly and then there are
people am I like getting the most out of
my team usually senior leadership team
because that's like who I'm most focused
on and I think in a similar way Kelly it
sounds like you're saying that
a CPO who's being really effective is a
confidant is like helping the CEO and
they're struggling with their cro and
they like don't know how to handle this
and they don't have Clarity internally
about what what do I do with this
situation but I think maybe like noan to
connect it to what you're saying I have
to think about like if you're so stuck
in the weeds it's pretty hard to be
strategic you know if you're just like H
but I can't even get through a day I
also think a good leader everything is
your fault right so if you're a CPO and
you're like I hate the scope of my role
it's your fault cuz that's I think what
like ownership um looks like and so I'd
say okay well take an audit of what
you're doing come up with a plan to like
get rid of the low value stuff the like
if the founder comes to you it is like
we need ping pong tables to improve
culture it's like okay you're coming
back with a memo that's like this is
wrong and here's what we're doing you
know or whatever and if you keep making
me do things that I think are dumb and
party plan or whatever eventually I will
just leave you because you're not using
me the right way but a lot of founders
ERS actually I think are like me and
that they don't know good people stuff
because they didn't come from Worlds
that like you know a lot of Founders
this is like our first jobs or our first
like real jobs like that's very common
and to the extent they have any
experience with any function it is
usually either go to market or
engineering and neither of those
organizations are sort of known for
being like I have a problem who's my
first call the che people officer you
know um roxen I want to ask about the
talent density at Athena so I've
experienced uh you know Mel who's a
friend I've experienced you I sat next
to Tess at my co-working space in Park
City and so like I got to hang out with
her a lot I find that your talent
density is very high and I find you I
experienced the three of you as like
very
serious highly intellectual like you
guys have fun and stuff too but like we
don't have that much fun we're not a fun
team I got to be on my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I like
what I was I was like I got to be on my
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when I show up to conversations
with you guys because it's like you know
this is kind of like a it's a serious
culture yeah what do you think about
this era right now to where I would say
like you know I think Google Maybe
started this with the you know work 30
hours a week sit on the roof for a
little while not get real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done are
you guys having a hard time setting the
employee expectation with like what your
business reality is are you finding that
there's like a tough clearing price
there between what employees expect and
what you guys expect for a moment we did
I think at the height of the tech Zer
silliness era yoga for dogs um I think
we did if I mean like fully candid we um
I we talking recently about some of the
experiments we run because we're like
I'm very open to experiments and one
that we did was summer Fridays where
people didn't work on Fridays and it did
not go well and we stopped that because
it was like this does not work but I
would argue that an era in which I was
like sounds good to Summer Fridays
probably indicates like that was the
peak of um of that I think though in
general we have not had a big issue
because uh we've had a lot of clarity in
our recruiting processes um about like
who we are and sort of like why you
should and shouldn't join us so like
jokes aside I remember joining McKenzie
and be like Oh people's kind of whole
life is here right there's like happy
hours every night and team dinners and
like if that is your jam we will be a
really disappointing company because we
like work really hard and then like
people close their laptops and usually
go do something else we're not uh like
you're not going to find us like shots
shots kind of company like it's just not
who we are and I totally get that that's
like a thing that some people are
looking for or they may be looking for
it at certain stages and so no in
general I would say we have not had an
issue but that's because like even I
don't know if we still do this but I
remember doing it some of my interviews
and I think it can be really jarring but
I think it can also be really clarifying
I would ask if we have to part ways in
six months what went wrong and I think
that just kind of IND like is an
indicator of I am aware that it's very
possible that we will need to part ways
I think sometimes people find that
surprising from a company that is run
heavily by women not by Design but
that's like um what our leadership team
looks like so I think they kind of
associate with like this is going to be
really caring and nurturing and then
like Melanie is a Shar like and I think
it took me a minute to like realize that
she's like so are you short yeah but
that I knew about me I didn't know about
her because she's like short and
friendly and bubbly and talks about like
dogs and possums and so I think it's
very easy to use charistics to equate
that versus like I think there's a lot
of tech posturing right now hardcore and
we this and we're and like um we haven't
really like LED with that messaging but
in general I think it sort of comes
through in the interview process and
people aren't um totally surprised yeah
I think that's the thing is that there
is a bias associated with a primarily
like leadership team of women that you
would expect totally I mean I have like
kids photos behind me it would be
reasonable for you to be like she's
going to be like super nice and instead
you know I'm like hey like I know her
poor BP marketing has like maybe
norovirus and I just like sent him a
slack it was like I really dislike this
thing that your team just put out and
I'm so sorry that you're probably like
vomiting your brains right now but also
I do not like
it you know also let's have some real
talk and feel better soon because we're
gonna have a conversation with you
exactly like and I'm not like I won't
remember to send him like a get well
package you know like it's just not
roxan I uh I sincerely appreciate your
authenticity last thing for me is
actually like what is like Thanksgiving
like with David
Petraeus um it usually starts with the
Turkey Trot um okay very good runner is
is I was gonna say is he
competitive oh he's incredibly
competitive we did a 5k for my wedding
the morning of and the rule was no one
is allowed to run faster than him
because just don't like like don't start
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tone wrong just don't like don't do
it you know that's incredible what's
that clip like what is that clip eight
minutes a mile oh I mean at like I mean
at his Peak he was like I don't know six
minute mile sub like it's ridiculous
he's and kind of super human um but I
would say in general thanksgivings are
fun talked about someone who's intense
so you know it works perfectly um a lot
of talked about leadership Etc yeah does
he make his bed uh I have no
 
idea it's not thing yeah Kelly's the
thing if you follow Joo or any of that
stuff like roxan had the the thing about
it's always the leader's fault like
that's definitely like a Joo military
principle I mean I would
say well it's also making your bed is it
it serves for a good day I always make
my bed you know I mean I have a duvet
it's like how hard a nice throw it over
you know I'm like it's like made I still
don't do it yeah I still not us oh my
God oh my God that follows you in all
aspects of your life no it does make
that it does all right roxan this was a
blast thank you so much for the time
thanks much roxan oh my gosh thank you
