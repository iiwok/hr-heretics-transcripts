will like be better when I exit it
because of the sort of hard stuff that
 
because of the sort of hard stuff that
I'm going to go through so how does one
 
I'm going to go through so how does one

through line and then in other ways it's
 
through line and then in other ways it's
random whenever I talk to like the youth
 
random whenever I talk to like the youth
the youngsters the youth and they ask
 
the youngsters the youth and they ask

wherever you can find the best people go
 
wherever you can find the best people go

talked I think and and that was probably
three years ago and something like that
 
three years ago and something like that
maybe two years ago and you were asking
 
maybe two years ago and you were asking
me like hey what what's it like out
 
me like hey what what's it like out
there how's training work L ms's and I
 
there how's training work L ms's and I
was like I can't stand lm's and usually
 
was like I can't stand lm's and usually
I can't stand L &amp; D it's a whole thing I
 
I can't stand L &amp; D it's a whole thing I
do remember this take I slacked my
 
do remember this take I slacked my
co-founder right after our conversation
 
co-founder right after our conversation
yeah yeah I just feel and I still feel
 
yeah yeah I just feel and I still feel
really strongly about I was talking to
 
really strongly about I was talking to
someone yesterday about it and I'd love
 
someone yesterday about it and I'd love
to get both your takes on on what's
 
to get both your takes on on what's
changing with that because I loved how
 
changing with that because I loved how
you started Athena based on it being
 
you started Athena based on it being
terrible and kind of all these things
 
terrible and kind of all these things
and I I get questions like should we
 
and I I get questions like should we
have an L&amp;D function what is it even
 
have an L&amp;D function what is it even
anymore what systems do you use what
 
anymore what systems do you use what
what how does it work and I just love to
 
what how does it work and I just love to
talk about that because I think that
 
talk about that because I think that
infuses into how you all built Athena
 
infuses into how you all built Athena
and work with your clients totally yeah
 
and work with your clients totally yeah
H I can start but like happy to Rift
 
H I can start but like happy to Rift
like take challenges all of it okay so
 
like take challenges all of it okay so
this is all credit to my co-founder in
 
this is all credit to my co-founder in
the very beginning she had this very
 
the very beginning she had this very
strong perspective that training is top
 
strong perspective that training is top
down so as a company Quizlet I tell
 
down so as a company Quizlet I tell
everyone you need to take Craftsman
 
everyone you need to take Craftsman
prevention and code of conduct and cyber
 
prevention and code of conduct and cyber
security training learning is bottom up
 
security training learning is bottom up
I want to become better at communicating
 
I want to become better at communicating
I want to be better at one-on ones it's
 
I want to be better at one-on ones it's
like Discovery based and it sort of
 
like Discovery based and it sort of
requires that and so we have built our
 
requires that and so we have built our
LMS our learning management system all
 
LMS our learning management system all
of our Tech optimized for the top down
 
of our Tech optimized for the top down
kind of approach that means things like
 
kind of approach that means things like
tracking
 
tracking
assignments um reporting so if you have
 
assignments um reporting so if you have
an auditor and you need to show that
 
an auditor and you need to show that
like Nolan took this cyber security
 
like Nolan took this cyber security
training at this time you can do that
 
training at this time you can do that
that is very different than I think what
 
that is very different than I think what
an ideal learning solution would be
 
an ideal learning solution would be
because that needs to Encompass a ton
 
because that needs to Encompass a ton
more use cases like compliance by
 
more use cases like compliance by
definition is regulated um you need to
 
definition is regulated um you need to
take largely the same training with the
 
take largely the same training with the
exception of State differences or
 
exception of State differences or
whatever um but learning is like we're
 
whatever um but learning is like we're
all on our own different journey and
 
all on our own different journey and
like the leadership training I need is
 
like the leadership training I need is
really different than the leadership
 
really different than the leadership
training that Melanie or CPO needs not
 
training that Melanie or CPO needs not
just because we're in different
 
just because we're in different
functions but because we're like
 
functions but because we're like
different humans with different
 
different humans with different
strengths and an and I thought I don't
 
strengths and an and I thought I don't
think we can build a system that really
 
think we can build a system that really
does that like that Technic seems if not
 
does that like that Technic seems if not
impossible like I don't know it just but
 
impossible like I don't know it just but
we're like what we can do is like really
 
we're like what we can do is like really
optimize for the compliance case
 
optimize for the compliance case
especially because we've since branched
 
especially because we've since branched
out into also having HR case management
 
out into also having HR case management
which we can talk about so it's like a
 
which we can talk about so it's like a
whole different platform if you ask me
 
whole different platform if you ask me
as like CEO me like Rex what's your
 
as like CEO me like Rex what's your
learning strategy at Athena I'd be like
 
learning strategy at Athena I'd be like
well it's certainly not an
 
well it's certainly not an
enterprise-wide LMS where I make
 
enterprise-wide LMS where I make
everyone take the same how to be better
 
everyone take the same how to be better
at Excel training and I'd go so far as
 
at Excel training and I'd go so far as
to say if Melanie our wonderful Chief
 
to say if Melanie our wonderful Chief
people officer pitched me on something
 
people officer pitched me on something
like this I'd be like that is
 
like this I'd be like that is
fundamentally misguided because I think
 
fundamentally misguided because I think
at least at a company like ours we're
 
at least at a company like ours we're
really relying on people to learn in
 
really relying on people to learn in
like a bunch of different ways so I
 
like a bunch of different ways so I
expect you to listen to podcasts like
 
expect you to listen to podcasts like
this one a side note or Melanie and I
 
this one a side note or Melanie and I
have a podcast you should listen to that
 
have a podcast you should listen to that
too um or um I expect you to talk to
 
too um or um I expect you to talk to
your peers I expect you to try stuff out
 
your peers I expect you to try stuff out
if like we have someone going out on mat
 
if like we have someone going out on mat
Le raise your hand and like do some of
 
Le raise your hand and like do some of
their job and that's how you're going to
 
their job and that's how you're going to
learn and I don't think that Lear
 
learn and I don't think that Lear
learning is just going to happen because
 
learning is just going to happen because
you took a 45 minute e learning course
 
you took a 45 minute e learning course
on like typ difficult conversations yeah
 
on like typ difficult conversations yeah
Nolan what do you think I always think
 
Nolan what do you think I always think
about starting with like what is the
 
about starting with like what is the
problem we're
 
problem we're
solving and I think you can get really
 
solving and I think you can get really
deep into this like well we want to
 
deep into this like well we want to
upskill our employees and we want to
 
upskill our employees and we want to
make sure that they continue to learn
 
make sure that they continue to learn
here and then basically what I've seen
 
here and then basically what I've seen
every single time is it like devolves
 
every single time is it like devolves
into this well let's just do what
 
into this well let's just do what
they're doing thing and we skip all
 
they're doing thing and we skip all
these other steps and go copy like what
 
these other steps and go copy like what
it
 
it
exists I actually think this is like one
 
exists I actually think this is like one
of the most challenging problems to
 
of the most challenging problems to
solve especially in the era of AI and
 
solve especially in the era of AI and
how fast companies are changing and how
 
how fast companies are changing and how
fast the expectations companies have of
 
fast the expectations companies have of
employees are
 
employees are
changing I feel like my current take
 
changing I feel like my current take
which I would love disagreement on is I
 
which I would love disagreement on is I
kind of feel like it's up to the
 
kind of feel like it's up to the
employee like there should be resources
 
employee like there should be resources
for the company that the company can
 
for the company that the company can
offer
 
offer
but it you know like who I'm never going
 
but it you know like who I'm never going
to be the person who's like oh let me go
 
to be the person who's like oh let me go
click on like the Excel training and go
 
click on like the Excel training and go
do that like it never shows up that way
 
do that like it never shows up that way
it always shows up as like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like
 
it always shows up as like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like
I have this Gap I need to solve it let
 
I have this Gap I need to solve it let
me do some of like I should first as
 
me do some of like I should first as
employee do my own research on how I can
 
employee do my own research on how I can
solve that for free then if I need to
 
solve that for free then if I need to
keep keep getting more learning in that
 
keep keep getting more learning in that
area then what I should do is go to my
 
area then what I should do is go to my
manager get some feedback from them on
 
manager get some feedback from them on
what I should be doing like triangulate
 
what I should be doing like triangulate
on this thing and maybe it's like a
 
on this thing and maybe it's like a
one-off class that you go take maybe
 
one-off class that you go take maybe
it's like we get you a coach I just feel
 
it's like we get you a coach I just feel
like we're trying to do these peanut
 
like we're trying to do these peanut
butter
 
butter
approaches because that's what we've
 
approaches because that's what we've
always done and it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] approach but
 
always done and it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] approach but
also the reason why peanut butter feels
 
also the reason why peanut butter feels
good is because it's equal right right
 
good is because it's equal right right
and everyone has access to that it's
 
and everyone has access to that it's
also very easy I feel like if you're
 
also very easy I feel like if you're
like tomorrow make a learning strategy
 
like tomorrow make a learning strategy
and you're like I gave everybody access
 
and you're like I gave everybody access
to X course Library that's like pretty
 
to X course Library that's like pretty
easy from an implementation exactly from
 
easy from an implementation exactly from
an implementation perspective if you're
 
an implementation perspective if you're
like did they learn um you know then
 
like did they learn um you know then
it's like that's actually really
 
it's like that's actually really
complicated to identify the skill gaps
 
complicated to identify the skill gaps
I'm trying to solve like I I mean I have
 
I'm trying to solve like I I mean I have
sympathy for people because that problem
 
sympathy for people because that problem
is much
 
is much
harder but I think I tend to agree that
 
harder but I think I tend to agree that
like an organic and employee driven
 
like an organic and employee driven
approach is best I think Melanie like we
 
approach is best I think Melanie like we
have an amazing relationship with think
 
have an amazing relationship with think
sh Rock I think one of the areas where
 
sh Rock I think one of the areas where
we tend to like approach things
 
we tend to like approach things
differently is I usually have a little
 
differently is I usually have a little
bit more of a like Sinker swim folks and
 
bit more of a like Sinker swim folks and
she has more of a hey we need to lay the
 
she has more of a hey we need to lay the
foundation and make sure that people
 
foundation and make sure that people
know about this and have access and Etc
 
know about this and have access and Etc
and I think maybe the answerers sort of
 
and I think maybe the answerers sort of
both are true like your best employees
 
both are true like your best employees
are always going to succeed in a sink or
 
are always going to succeed in a sink or

it which is actually what I think is
going on and I think there's also
 
going on and I think there's also
misalignment with what the role should
 
misalignment with what the role should
be on the way in and then it's like you
 
be on the way in and then it's like you
just start taking on more and then it's
 
just start taking on more and then it's
like you basically just become like the
 
like you basically just become like the
dumpster for no one else wants to deal
 
dumpster for no one else wants to deal
with that's like you go do it or or they
 
with that's like you go do it or or they
don't know how to deal with it because
 
don't know how to deal with it because
it's complex and high stakes and
 
it's complex and high stakes and
uncomfortable and so they just kind of
 
uncomfortable and so they just kind of
but Kelly you've seen this discussion
 
but Kelly you've seen this discussion
online right of course uh the CEO or the
 
online right of course uh the CEO or the

all this like still don't totally
 
all this like still don't totally
understand HR which I think has actually
 
understand HR which I think has actually
made me be like here is how I think it
 
made me be like here is how I think it
should work at our company because like
 
should work at our company because like
as another thing I'm really curious
 
as another thing I'm really curious
about like what's the distinction
 
about like what's the distinction
between a CPO and a COO if a CPO in my
 
between a CPO and a COO if a CPO in my
mind is doing what a CPO should be doing
 
mind is doing what a CPO should be doing
but we can kind of get to um I don't
 
but we can kind of get to um I don't
know if that's a very spicy take because
 
know if that's a very spicy take because
I don't understand the um things
 
I don't understand the um things
so Melanie actually has a very small
 
so Melanie actually has a very small
team right like there's not that many
 
team right like there's not that many
people in HR which I think is true in
 
people in HR which I think is true in
most companies like your HR or is
 
most companies like your HR or is
smaller than your sales work it's
 
smaller than your sales work it's
smaller than than your engineering work
 
smaller than than your engineering work
or whatever so I think that an effective
 
or whatever so I think that an effective
CPO in my mind like if we take an
 
CPO in my mind like if we take an
example of RTO I'm like how could you
 
example of RTO I'm like how could you
possibly designate that to the CPO
 
possibly designate that to the CPO
because guess what they only have like I
 
because guess what they only have like I
don't know 15 employees or whatever so
 
don't know 15 employees or whatever so
it's like yeah you could be like all of
 
it's like yeah you could be like all of
you guys better be in the office but
 
you guys better be in the office but
it's like you got to get the sales team
 
it's like you got to get the sales team
into the office that's who the CEO cares
 
into the office that's who the CEO cares
about or the um engineering team or
 
about or the um engineering team or
whatever I think how Melanie is able to
 
whatever I think how Melanie is able to
do stuff is she realizes that her job is
 
do stuff is she realizes that her job is
not um she's not actually in charge of
 
not um she's not actually in charge of
very many people so what she has to do
 
very many people so what she has to do
is like work
 
is like work
with the head of sales work with the
 
with the head of sales work with the
head of engineering and get them to
 
head of engineering and get them to
implement the stuff that like they need
 
implement the stuff that like they need
to implement and if they're not going to
 
to implement and if they're not going to
do it Melanie's kind of like I don't
 
do it Melanie's kind of like I don't
know what to tell you xan like Matt
 
know what to tell you xan like Matt
won't you know um whatever change this B
 
won't you know um whatever change this B
difference with our wew work policy or
 
difference with our wew work policy or
whatever but I'm not actually expecting
 
whatever but I'm not actually expecting
Melanie to do everything because that
 
Melanie to do everything because that
would be ridiculous because then
 
would be ridiculous because then
everyone would need to like the
 
everyone would need to like the
reporting or doesn't support
 
reporting or doesn't support
that right so I just like hold my VP is
 
that right so I just like hold my VP is
quite responsible if my VP of sales is
 
quite responsible if my VP of sales is
like our AES aren't very good and I'm
 
like our AES aren't very good and I'm
having performance issues that's a
 
having performance issues that's a
Melanie problem it' be like oh no that's
 
Melanie problem it' be like oh no that's
that's a you problem and then the same
 
that's a you problem and then the same
happens with hiring right the same
 
happens with hiring right the same
happens with hiring that's a recruiting
 
happens with hiring that's a recruiting
problem versus right when we at the very
 
problem versus right when we at the very
beginning of our company it took us a
 
beginning of our company it took us a
minute to figure out hiring Engineers we
 
minute to figure out hiring Engineers we
had like some misfires and you know
 
had like some misfires and you know
whatever this happens and we weren't I
 
whatever this happens and we weren't I
guess it was actually a premale but it
 
guess it was actually a premale but it
would be true if B H been there an and I
 
would be true if B H been there an and I
weren't like boy what's wrong with HR
 
weren't like boy what's wrong with HR
what's wrong with our talent processes
 
what's wrong with our talent processes
it was like this is an engineering
 
it was like this is an engineering
problem that like engineering needs to
 
problem that like engineering needs to
figure out yeah and I guess like if
 
figure out yeah and I guess like if
you're in that situation
 
you're in that situation
though I think what the thing to say is
 
though I think what the thing to say is
like who is the dri who is the directly
 
like who is the dri who is the directly
responsible individual here because I
 
responsible individual here because I
think that's what's going on because I
 
think that's what's going on because I
think like very few PE I think CEOs
 
think like very few PE I think CEOs
would say that HR is responsible for AE
 
would say that HR is responsible for AE
is hitting quota attainment right they'
 
is hitting quota attainment right they'

sounds like you're saying that
 
sounds like you're saying that
a CPO who's being really effective is a
 
a CPO who's being really effective is a
confidant is like helping the CEO and

connect it to what you're saying I have
 
connect it to what you're saying I have
to think about like if you're so stuck
 
to think about like if you're so stuck
in the weeds it's pretty hard to be
 
in the weeds it's pretty hard to be
strategic you know if you're just like H
 
strategic you know if you're just like H
