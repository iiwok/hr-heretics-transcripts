# Why L&D Fails (And How to Fix It) with Fidelma Butler

## Transcript

 
For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, Couchbase CPO Fidelma Butler
discusses building leadership
frameworks, embedding learning and
workflows, and solving career
developments, promotion, fixation.
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have Fidelma Butler on. Fidelma, you are
the chief people officer at Couch Base.
You had a long stint at Zenesk. welcome
to the show.
&gt;&gt; Grace, thank you so much. I'm delighted
to be here with Kelly and Nolan.
&gt;&gt; So, we met at dinner a couple weeks ago
and then we caught up after and we were
talking about a couple days L &amp; D and
engagement
and friend of the pod David Hanrahan was
on maybe last month and was like, "Look,
I'm just starting a new chief people
officer gig. I'm actually thinking a lot
about L &amp; D. I haven't seen it done
super well. If anybody has ideas, let me
Oh, and so that's the genesis for this
conversation, which I tend to agree with
David. I have not seen L &amp; D done very
well anywhere. I think when money was
free, it was really easy to just throw
dollars at the problem. You know, Google
has more classes than God for their
employees. How do you think about it
given Couchbase is a much different
operation than some of the larger tech
companies? Yeah, look, I think I would
start with saying that L &amp; D being done
well is just so tailored and nuanced to
the size and scale of the organization
and the challenges that you're trying to
solve. I actually know David very well.
David actually hired me into Zenesk and
then relocated me to the United States a
few years ago. He and I have spent a lot
of time in the past talking about this
particular topic.
I think for me coming into couch base
the beauty of it in one way and the
challenge was that there really was no
learning and development happening. So
this was about two and a quarter years
ago about 800 employees and post IPO. So
public company with decent headcount and
very very little learning and
development happening formally
throughout the organization. It was a
space that just really hadn't been
invested in. And I I mean that in terms
of dollars or time. And for me, those
leaders are the most critical part of
learning and development. My team, any
HR team, right, it's only ever going to
be so big. We're never going to have all
of the dollars that we need for the
resources that we perhaps think that we
should have. And so for me, the people
leaders are the extension of the people
team. So I always want to focus there.
So step one for us at Couchbase was
let's define what does good leadership
mean here in this organization and then
design some programming on the back of
that and now we're actually talking
about what what does the next phase look
like.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I like the idea of basically
saying like you know what is good
leadership and what is top performance
look like here.
&gt;&gt; How did you figure out the definition of
good leadership? Because I think every
company at some point runs into this
problem which is like I want great
leaders and it's like well like that
means something different to everybody
like Elon thinks about leaders one way
versus you know Larry at Google. So how
did you guys go about defining in that
process? Yeah. So I actually was very
very fortunate to bring director of
learning and development with me from a
previous organization. And so very
quickly she and I started having
conversations with the CEO as to when we
have a solid leader in this
organization, somebody who's performing
above what we would expect, what is it
that they're bringing to the table and
what are they doing differently? And we
would collect these anecdotes that we
were also hearing across the
organization of people showing up
particularly well in a particular
example or
stories of maybe people who didn't work
out and what did that entail. And very
quickly we realized that we could ground
it all in some language that she and I
had actually been using elsewhere at the
highest level and then adjusted for
couch base below that. And so we went
out to our executive team with this
particular model that defined leadership
in in three ways. Number one was how you
lead yourself, how you show up, how you
practice empathy, how you communicate
with integrity. Few other examples that
are quite specific to us within that
second attribute is how you lead your
team. So how you you know develop them
promote their career development but
also generate high performance from them
and then finally how you actually lead
couch base. So how you demonstrate that
you are creating that sustained
differentiation through the work that
you're doing how you're adding value how
you're operating crossf functionally. So
really trying to go after the things
that we were hearing the organization
particularly needed and the things that
those higher performers seemed to be
doing well. So now we had a language,
right? Now we had something that we
could bring into a talent review, but
also something that we could now start
to build some learning content on the
back of hanging out in theoretical land
and in PowerPoint land and in kind of
corporate university land.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, lots of triangles, lots of models.
I think part of the challenge with the
field of learning and development
traditionally has been that it has
forgotten that it needs to meet people
where they are. And at times it can be
well we're putting out these programs
and people aren't engaging with them.
And these programs are these big huge
vehicles that cost a lot of money that
take take people away from their actual
core work where they are creating value
to go back to that language. And instead
we've got to meet people where they are
and try and find ways to compete with
the eyeballs. So maybe that is a podcast
while people drive to work. That's how I
do a lot of learning, listening to the
likes of you and others. Talking to
other people in my field, right?
Learning can take many forms. And I
think unfortunately the learning and
development infrastructure that exists
out there can be very oriented towards
the the big playbooks that made sense in
the earlier part of my career. What
happens when there's disagreement
between the narrative of the engagement
survey and the top-down initiatives from
the CEO?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll give you an example. So, one
thing that has shown up for us is
employees wanting to know more and more
and more about company strategy, our
messaging, our positioning in the
competitive landscape, what all of that
looks like.
And there have definitely been moments
where I've thought, but hang on, like we
just had kickoff, right? We do a sales
kickoff. We just had kickoff for the
whole company. And I think as HR leaders
and and as learning and development
leaders, I think we can often be guilty
of but we told them and we told them and
we told them again like we did all of
that. But actually, if you take a step
back, no, it's incumbent upon me to
deliver that message differently because
it's clearly not reaching everybody in
the way they need it all of the time. So
maybe I've got to find ways to share
some byite-size content on Slack. That's
all part of learning and development. I
had a leader say to me like there's just
there's no interview training. My guys
don't know how to interview. I was like
that training that we launched about
three months ago and many of them have
participated in that. You just haven't
seen it. This is a busy sales leader.
The better answer, the more kind of
business partnering oriented answer is
yeah, we have that. It's ready to go.
How would you like us to deliver that to
your team? That's how you actually meet
people where they are.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like all of that. I really do
because that's how I think about it.
Engagement, survey, actions,
communications, L &amp; D. I was just
talking to someone about this. Trying to
make it and weave it in as much as you
can to the fairway of the job and the
day-to-day,
it just works. And I think that's the
problem with I think the semantic of L &amp;
D. We should probably call it something
different because when you think of L &amp;
D, you think about something extra.
Taking them off the line, taking them
out of the job, paying a bunch of money,
listening to a facilitator from a fancy
consulting group. Like that's how it's
always been. And that's really not what
it is. Like I told someone at Quizlet,
I'm like, guess what? L &amp; D is going to
be the fair way of the job. We are going
to leverage leaders teaching leaders
because no one listens to HR. We're
going to help test like we are going to
make this a part of the gig where you
don't feel like you're going to traffic
school on a Saturday.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you you nailed the leaders
teaching leaders thing, Kelly. So, we've
heard that twice on the show. So, once
from Brian Power and then the other one
from Valentina Gon. And in both of those
cases, the thing I took away was like,
yeah, like I actually think leaders
teaching other leaders is the best way
for it to sit it. And like I would
listen to that versus like, you know, HR
shows up and I'm like like you know,
everyone's eyes like immediately roll
like all right well they're operating on
HR island and everyone else like is
actually like trying to drive revenue
for the business. So Fella, how do you
guys think about like do you engage your
leaders to teach Absolutely. So we get
that senior leadership team together on
a quarterly basis. I'm thinking of a
recent example where one of the team
actually raised his hand to say I want
to do something around people taking
accountability right and I want to talk
to my peers about how we can drive some
more of that. So he came in and he
presented on that topic got some input
from the group and now he's actually
working on something that we will use in
a learning and development capacity with
my team. So yes, I find that very very
valuable. At our sales kickoff,
I brought up on stage four employees who
have had great career development and
people really valued hearing their
perspectives. They could have listened
to me for 45 minutes, right? Talking at
them about career development and what
they need to do, but actually listening
to those people that you respect, those
people that you know, those people that
you had a drink with the night before,
that's where I think people took a lot
of value.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. Metave is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metave suite of AI agents works for you
at every stage of the hiring process.
Their platform powers instant job post
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metivview changes
all of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metave covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Deal, 11 Labs, and Kora. And check out

AI enabled in minutes.
&gt;&gt; You had mentioned coaching earlier as
well. So
I the coaching kind of similar to what
Kelly's been saying about nomenclature.
I think for some people they've you know
I think for like I'm a former athlete
it's like oh my god like makes a ton of
sense right? Serena Williams best tennis
player in the world has a coach. Tiger
Woods, best golfer in the world, has a
coach. Shouldn't we all have coaches?
But then you kind of get these like poor
examples of it that I think dilutes what
it should be. So, how do you guys think
about coaching? Where do you deploy it?
What does it look like?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for us, it is those most
senior leaders. So
a couple of years ago we started with a
subset of them participating in a
leadership program. It's through
sounding board and
I think by now we've had maybe 40 of the
 
participated in it. But I think where
coaching has helped us is that when I
take a step back and I look across
leaders
it's never really their technical
knowledge. It's never really their
experience that holds them back, but
it's maybe their ability to deliver a
conversation in a certain way. Maybe
it's their ability to make it seem like
they're not nervous when they're talking
to a large group of people, to command
an audience, to have executive presence.
It tends to be those intangible, the
unmeasurable, immeasurable things. But
that's where coaching has really helped
with us because, you know, this
one-sizefits-all approach, it's just not
really the answer. It's not the modern
answer anymore. You know, we all want to
have diverse workforces in every single
way. Well, we all learn differently,
right? We all consume information
differently. We all just have different
needs and different energy levels. And
so, that's really what we've been able
to find with coaching is that it can
deliver that personalized piece. And so,
it's a long way of answering your
question, but for me, what am I thinking
about when I hire these people? It's do
they get that right? Do they want to go
away and build PowerPoint decks for a
few hours at a time or are they thinking
about what are the new tools that are
coming down the line in this space that
can help me to get learning content in
front of people on Slack for example or
when they log in in the morning a
question of like have you given feedback
today whatever it is those are the
skills that I'm looking for and within
our team here you know we have people
who have learning and development
diversity equity inclusion and
engagement
backgrounds and they're all mingled
together within the team. We're going to
more formally have them all start to
lean into each other's work a little bit
because all of those things to me are
just so highly correlated.
&gt;&gt; I love that. The last one for me,
Fidelma, is actually around getting it
wrong. So like it's it seems like you
you are very well put together on the
way you're thinking about this. You're
engaging the business, right? We're
launching very quickly. We're not
launching perfect solutions, but I think
a lot of people who have tried this have
at at some point in time been punched in
the face with like that one didn't land.
Do you have an example of that and then
how you learn from it and then how you
move forward?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the toughest area in all
of this is actually meeting people where
they are in terms of career development.
And that's one that several times over
the course of my career I've felt a bit
punched in the face because people will
always say in every interaction that you
have whether that's a survey or anything
else that they want more career
development.
&gt;&gt; Totally never ending.
&gt;&gt; Two sales kickoffs ago, I stood on the
stage and I said, "Who wants career
development?" Every hand in the room
goes up. Okay. Who's done a development
plan?
A smattering of hands go up, right? And
that can actually sting. It's like why
am I designing all of these tools,
building these tools and putting them
out there? So there have been times
where and I I'm going through that now
where I'm thinking okay how can I
actually give people what they need? I
think that people are asking in that
example for how can I get to the next
level right and as a professional in
this space I'm thinking no how can you
be ready for the next opportunity
whether that is up across a stretch
whatever cross functional doesn't matter
that the career model of the past isn't
necessarily the career model that I
think is needed in the future but not
everybody is on board with that yet
people are thinking about how can I get
to the next level, the next level, the
next level. Well, there has to be an
opportunity. It has to be at the right
time. You have to be ready. That can be
hard for people to quantify, to take,
right? People want actual timelines.
And so, that is something that I have
not cracked that nut yet. And if anybody
has, I'd love to hear it. I think that
can be quite hard. I am a huge
disbeliever in those spreadsheets that
very often are produced within people
teams of the different levels and then
like the behaviors that are needed at
each level and the verb changes you know
it's give guidance on blleh lead blah as
you go up the levels it'll become a
checkbox exercise no one's learning from
that your lower performers are using
that to tick the boxes to then say
please promote me your higher performers
are like that's of course I'm doing that
like that that doesn't need to specified
and I just don't know that we have fully
cracked that nut. And in particular,
what we're trying to do as learning and
development professionals at the moment
is prepare people for careers that don't
look anything like what they look like
today. You know, there are people
graduating colleges over the next few
months who are heading into the world of
work who will be doing very different
things to what they thought they would
be doing when they made those choices.
And the same is true of tenur
professionals as well. So that is the
piece where I definitely find challenge.
Nolan,
&gt;&gt; I think real talk, I think we have
another semantics issue with employees
using career development cuz when you
say that automatically they think of
more money and a higher title. That's
what it is. So which I love. We should
just call it that. I'd be like, "Hey,
who wants to learn about how to get
promoted here? Let's do that. Who wants
to learn about comp and how you can make
more money and how we think about comp
here? Let's do that." So I feel like
that that whole bucket itself needs to
be stratified
because that's been a big like
misinterpretation in my career when I
say career development and I think it
still happens that employees think about
that differently than we think about
that.
&gt;&gt; You guys are both right about this which
is like on the career development piece.
This is probably why I'm mo I'm super
jaded on the topic is because Fidelma,
you you nailed it, which is like the
checkbox exercise, right? People lower
in the or show up and they go, I did it.
Where's my promo? And and then I think
ultimately I've seen so many
organizations become promotion obsessed.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; That like I like lose my mind about it
because I'm like this is we're here.
This is not about getting promotion.
Like of course like we want to make sure
people progress. They're getting paid
very well, obviously fairly is the
floor, but then obviously very well as
they perform well in the organization.
And man, I I'm really starting to think
like the big issue with this, Kelly, is
actually the ladders and how we come up
with ladders and how we do ladders. And
that's where I think people get jaded.
&gt;&gt; But I struggle you both of you. What's
the alternative?
&gt;&gt; I know you're flattening it.
&gt;&gt; You can't have nothing because I started
at high growth companies and there was
nothing and it was chaos. like
I'll take the ladders right now. Just I
don't know what the alternative is and
maybe there will never be a perfect
answer.
But I think what has worked is just
trying to do these squishy things as
transparently and raw and direct as you
can with employees. That works.
That that works. And even if it's
uncomfortable and messy, it works better
than engagement and career ladders and
surveys. You know what I mean? Like you
can at least get further with them when
you're just kind of real about it. Speak
their language. And you said it earlier
meet them where they are.
&gt;&gt; It's amazing what a real conversation
can do, right? In every aspect of
everything. Like a real conversation
about what are you actually trying to
achieve? Yeah, I just had this story
with my wife. I was like, what is this
really about?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm a big believer in hiring
adults and then really treating them
like adults, right? So, to my point
earlier of, well, who's filled in career
development plan? Like, there's a huge
amount of accountability that needs to
be taken here. I'm not going to spoon
feed you. I'm not going to go out there
and say you didn't come to XYZ training.
You had that opportunity. And frankly,
the people who are going to get
recognized and are going to experience
the career development piece are the
people who are leaning into all of those
and who are recognized as taking
accountability and taking their
opportunities when they come and then
the rewards then follow that.
&gt;&gt; It's not that you as HR is sitting there
with a you know magic wand being like
you attended this, you're getting
promoted, you didn't you it actually
shows up in a bunch of different ways.
Filma, this has been great. Where can
people find you?
&gt;&gt; Sure. Well, like everybody, they can
find me on LinkedIn and reach out to me
there. Happy to connect with everybody.
And it's been a pleasure chatting to you
all today. I'm very aware that I'm
speaking from a very empty room. We're
actually moving our headquarters over
the next few days, which is also a
project that's on my
&gt;&gt; I thought you were in like a CIA black
site. It's like totally like it's good
to know you're still in a conference
room.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's cool.
&gt;&gt; I should have done this a week later
when we were in our really cool office
at Santana. Thank you so much for the
time, Fidelma.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks, Adelma.
&gt;&gt; Thank you both.
