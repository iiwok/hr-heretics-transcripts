## Transcript

 
[Applause]
[Music]
 
Hey everyone, how are you all doing out
there? Uh we're back here with another
session of HR heretics. I'm so excited
to have Dave Margulius on today, Nolan.
So Dave is one of the co-founders and a
board member at Quizlet. You all know
I've been interim uh chief people
officer for Quizlet for about seven
months now and have been working closely
with Dave and the board and Dave and I
chatted a few months ago Nolan and he
had this incredible story of how they
started Quizlet and why they started it
and the journey of that and how Dave was
in his 40s when he started Quizlet with
teenagers and how that you know went and
has been there for 18 years which is a
whole another topic that I love to talk
about that 18 years, but we're so
excited to have you and dig into this
today, Dave, and your journey as a
founder and yeah, learn some nuggets
from you. So, thanks for being here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dave, you haven't fired Kelly yet.
Can we start there?
 
&gt;&gt; She's doing a great job.
&gt;&gt; Okay, whatever. Whatever. We'll talk
about your toes because, you know, we
are testing some AI CPOS and
&gt;&gt; Oh, here we go.
&gt;&gt; Here we go. Right into it, Dave. This is
what we wanted. They're making a robot
version of me and it's going to replace
me and it swears less so it'll be great.
Um,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; but but Quizlet's a great company day. I
mean, I first of all, I've stayed there
for longer than I thought I would
because the culture and the humans are
wonderful, which is my number one. But
Nolan, I've told you multiple times over
the past six months. It's an incredible
business like started 20 years ago and
has a great I'm not going to go into
details but you know Siri C company very
successful organically and you just
don't see that a lot.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Dave give us a rundown.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So well first of all I'll go into
sell mode here with you Kelly like
really now is the time to join full-time
because the opportunity ahead of Quizlet
has never been bigger. And I'll just
like give a little big picture here on
global education online. There's$5
trillion dollars a year gets spent on
education and most of that is people in
buildings. Meanwhile, the attention of
all the kids has shifted to their
phones, right? And a big problem with
education is it's too expensive. Like we
used to hear in the early days from
people on Navajo reservations or in the
outback of Australia or in Russia,
Brazil or whatever like, "Hey, this is
cool. a free tool we can just use
because uh you know we don't have access
to a teacher or a schoolhouse or
whatever. Um and so technology can scale
to do that. There's going to be two or
three companies that figure out how to
be the global brand and platform for
inspiring kids to learn, helping them to
learn, and they're going to be huge.
We're in a position to be one of them,
which I'm really excited about. we have
a new team on board, a new CEO who
you've been working with and our pace of
innovation is accelerating and now we
can leverage AI. So I'm just really
excited about the future and I'm excited
about it for another reason which is
that you know we have a lot of
innovation that we need in the world. I
work on climate now just to solve the
climate problems we need a lot of
innovation to happen fast right and we
don't know which of these two billion
students in the world is going to be the
next you know Albert or Jane Einstein
and figure out these things and so we
need to educate all of them and any tool
that can scale and do a good job helping
kids you know study and learn like
that's how we're going to get these
innovations faster right now everybody's
on their screens they're mostly on Tik
Tok
We need them to be studying warning
also. And it's really good that all the
big LLM platforms are launching study
stuff. Like that's exciting because more
studying and warning is just good.
&gt;&gt; Totally.
&gt;&gt; So I'll start off with that. That's been
sort of the driver the whole time. If
you want, I can tell you kind of how we
got started. But I've been really lucky.
I was really lucky to randomly run into
this kid who was 17 who had this passion
for education, had coded a study app
that he was using with his friends in
his high school and it started to
spread. And then I got to work with, you
know, a bunch of his friends and like
MIT interns who were all teenagers in
this window of time where they had
access to all these great tools and APIs
and uh free platforms and cloud services
that they could just put together
and get it out there and make it happen
and let it scale. So I got got lucky to
be able to work with them. They were so
good and passionate. And then I've
gotten lucky after because we did
finally raise money in 2015. USV Costa
Ventures, Altos Ventures, and we've had
really good high integrity VCs on the
board. We've had a good board. The first
professional CEO we hired was a great
guy, high integrity, and the company has
had this culture of like, yeah, we care
about education. We care about the
users. And that's been that's been
wonderful. But what's really exciting is
what's happening now, which is we're
revving it up and we've got all this
cool stuff in the pipeline for this fall
and next year. And you know, this can be
big. So that's my pitch to you, Kelly.
&gt;&gt; That's so good. I can't believe you just
started this thing pitching Kelly, which
is like made my day.
&gt;&gt; See, I'm doing a good job, Nolan.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Me and Dave are going to
talk offline. Dave, I want to talk about
this CEO hire. I'm assuming what happens
is is you decide to step down. Then
we're going to find a replacement CEO.
What was that like? How did you find
that person? What was the dating process
like? How has it been for your team?
Like that's, you know, founder-ledd
companies are kind of like the thing
now. And many of these founders don't
step away for a very long time. So, can
you walk us through that experience?
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, happy to. We're actually on
CEO 3 now. I was one.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Really great guy named Matt Clattach was
CEO number two. Um, and now we're on CEO
number three. But I think probably I
should tell the story of how we got
&gt;&gt; from 2007 to 2015,
&gt;&gt; please.
&gt;&gt; Um,
and so, you know, I
launched my first website in 1995, which
was basically the year the web started.
It was boston.com owned by the Boston
Globe and New York Times company. Did
that for a few years. Went and worked at
Netscape, Evite, some other startups at
a VC firm. got into enterprise stuff and
by 2006 I decided you know I want to do
consumer stuff again but I don't want to
raise money I've seen that movie what
can I do bootstrapped tried to learn
HTML and CSS and actually was able to
build some websites and come up with
some ideas and then realized you know I
I can't code I need somebody who can
code I don't have any money who can I
find who I can work with
&gt;&gt; and I was going to WordPress meetups and
Matt Mullenmeg was actually at the
WordPress meetups in those days and I
asked him like, "Do you know anybody?"
He's like, "Well, there's that kid." And
he pointed me to just a wonderful human
being, uh, Andrew Sutherland, who is the
kid in question who started Quizlet in
his high school. And I started working
with him when he was in high school,
like literally driving over the bridge,
waiting till high school is out, picking
him up at high school. We'd go to a
coffee shop, we'd pay for the Wi-Fi, and
we'd sit there and work together
initially on the ideas I had. And I
asked him, "Which of these do you want
to work on?" Because I had a bunch. It's
like that one. And we we built up that
business. It was an eBay affiliate
focused on vintage and antiques. Um,
which was just unbelievable to me that
this was even possible. eBay was such a
big dumb company that had no idea how to
merchandise its auction stuff that we're
able to use their APIs
and uh and provide a better brows
experience for all these different
vintage categories and then they'd give
us a cut. So when somebody came to our
site and bought like a vintage record or
a vintage glass Paul guitar or an
expensive brooch and these are like four
or $5,000 items sometimes $10,000 800
we'd get a cut which was like six 7%.
And so we started this, we coded it like
in one weekend and then we added some
content later. Literally in one weekend
I had several conversations with Andrew
and this is what's inspiring about
working with teenagers and young people
is they
they don't have all these preconceived
notions about what's possible. So I
would, you know, pick them up, we'd get
to the coffee shop and I'd say, "Hey, I
had this idea. How many months would it
take to build this?" And he'd be like
months. like we could do that this
weekend. And then he would, you know,
and that was just so inspiring. So
&gt;&gt; he's the OG vibe coder.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Dose, who leads talent at Signal Fire,
told me to check out MeteView. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metiv is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
MeteView covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metav. Head over to metav.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metab's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
So it that that is that is so
interesting because I'm drawing
parallels to like you know those kids
that showed up at the White House with
their laptops and off the do like I feel
like that was very rare back then you
know what I mean like right and but now
all these
&gt;&gt; I I don't know so when I met him he was
already involved in like several open-
source projects and building on mood
tools and other stuff. He had he had
hacked into his high school's like
grading system just to show that it
could be done. And he took it down to
the principal. He's like, "Listen, I'm
into your account." And they freaked
out. And so the security company that
had their thing like called him and
said, "Do you want to work for us?" And
he's like, "No, I want to work on," he
was passionate about education. So, like
these kids I was I don't know about
those Doge people, but these kids I were
working on, they weren't
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to even say it like they
were cool and they were wanted to build
cool stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That helped people and that had an
impact at scale. So, we did this, you
know, vintage thing. It started gushing
cash, you know, over like the seven
years we bootstrapped it generated like
$12 million. Um, which we used, we
plowed it all into Quizlet. We set up an
LLC with these two separate businesses
so we could take all the revenue, just
plow it into building Quizlet. And um
you know the thing that happened was we
worked together from 2007.
It was just me and him for like almost
four years. He wanted to go to college.
So we decided, okay, we'll take it slow.
You go to college. I'll build up the
business, the team here in San
Francisco. You'll come back and work
summers. Then we started hiring people
around 2011 and it turned out to mostly
be people that he knew or were his peers
or had met at MIT, MIT interns. You
know, we had the 17-year-old from San
Jose State who was our DevOps person who
was originally part-time but like the
web isn't part-time. So, he was really
full-time. We had the
guy Andrew Mel when he was 16 who was
now 18 who was the security and search
expert who said, "Yeah, I'll come help
you for a week." And you know, two years
later, he's still there. And then the
sort of most ridiculous one was our
first iOS app was built by a
 
And what happened was um we couldn't
afford an iOS developer. This is like
 
Twitter did and said anybody wants can
build a Quizlet app. and uh like a
hundred people did and they mostly
sucked. There was like a content
licensing thing and branding
requirements and whatever. Some were
good, one was great. So, we were like,
you know, we should just try to hire
that person. Somebody give them a call.
And, you know, somebody called and
they're like, I think he's a little
young. Um, well, how young? And so, he
was 14. We got on a plane, a couple
couple people, Andrew and a product
person, Joanna, got on a plane. She
happened to be from that area, met with
his mom, hung out with him, and we
realized, wow, the summer's coming up.
He could come for the summer and intern
um and build our first Quizlet app. He
was up for it, his mom was up for it,
his dad was up for it. The problem was
they were getting a divorce and it was
really not, it wasn't amicable. They
weren't even talking to each other. So
what I had to then do was like get on
the phone for weeks, negotiating with
them individually and finally making
them get it was like everything I did
was like counseling in those days just
to kind of wrangle people and keep keep
them on board, recruit them,
&gt;&gt; keep Dave sounds like an HR job. pretty
much that's what I think that starting
an early stage startup especially
without VC capital is like starting a
religion like you got to be selling
every day evangelizing every day and you
know that's what we did andrew helped
too he was great at it he's not only
technical technically very talented guy
but he's sort of business savvy and he
was good at like selling the gospel of
like yes you could go to Stripe you
could go to Dropbox box.
Here's why you should do this because
you can have outsiz impact. Like this is
the only place, you know, Ryan, where
you're going to be be in charge of all
the servers that are serving like
thousands and tens of thousands of
simultaneous users while doing it
part-time and going to San Jose State.
You know,
 
&gt;&gt; Dave, I I can imagine how exhausting it
must have been like maybe being one of
the only adults in the room, maybe the
only one for a while and building a
business and kind of teaching them
through that. What was the mental model
for you to be able to do all that? How
did you like organize your energy and
how did you keep that up?
&gt;&gt; It was just pure adrenaline. I'd get up,
I'd swim, which is still my routine
today. I'd go into work and then I'd
just start doing it and um you know like
I'd end up doing the the crappy stuff,
you know, the payroll stuff, all the HR,
the legal, the financial, the
accounting, like as cheap as we could
because we didn't have that much money
like um by the time we raised money, we
had 35 people and a million bucks in the
bank, which is way different than, you
know, three years earlier when we had
these core eight people and a million
bucks in the bank. Um, so it was just
pure adrenaline and living it. And it
the tough thing was keeping up with them
because they were living it too. There
was a core group of like seven or eight
engineers. These all under 20. And then
a couple product people who were like
 
would kind of roll in at 10. They do a
little work. They'd go out to this
Korean barbecue place for lunch. That
was like a two-hour delay of game.
They'd come back. they'd get rolling and
then we ordered in expensive sushi, you
know, at 8. Um, and then that was
another two hours away delay game and
then they'd really get to work at like
 
ah, I can stay here till midnight, but
then I just got to I can't, you know, so
it just was exhausting, but it was also
so cool to watch what they could build
and how many students we were serving.
We were in every country, you know. We
had a great model. The premium model is
the one that works in consumer and
especially in education. Selling to
schools doesn't work which is why not
too many good entrepreneurs have gone
into education but it doesn't scale
right. Um so yeah it was pure adrenaline
and also fear like this was this was my
only thing like I had to make it work. I
didn't have a plan B or a fallback plan
so I just made it work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I do want to talk about this like
CEO change. So when you so you guys ran
the business, you raised VC capital and
then talk to us about like when you
decided to step away from operating
today.
&gt;&gt; So really it it has to do with the from
 
All of these young people were like
thrilled to just be doing this. Like it
was serving kids their age. It was cool
technical problems to solve. It was fun.
they would just do it in a pack like and
they were motivated by like can we build
a cool multiplayer game with the cutting
edge technology that started to change
like around 2013
when you know Facebook acquired
Instagram for a billion dollars and
there were random companies getting
acquired for hund00 million you know uh
Stripe was looking like it was going to
be huge and Uber and um so they started
to be like, "Yeah, what we're doing is
cool, but like we really need the VC
money um to have that cache to attract
the best engineers starting 20134."
&gt;&gt; I didn't want to do VC like we didn't
actually need to. We could have
bootstrapped it.
&gt;&gt; Um and I'd seen the movie, right? I
didn't want to do that movie. As it
turned out, we had bootstrapped enough
for long enough and built something
strong enough that we could handpick our
VCs and we ended up we did end up
needing the money because we were like
we had the footprint of Taco Bell with
the resources of a taco truck I used to
say. Um so at that point it was also
clear that I wasn't the right CEO. They
wanted to go faster with a professional
CEO with VCs. And so we did this
transition where we, you know, Andrew
and I with the VCs picked the CEO
together. We interviewed lots of people.
We got an awesome guy with really good
values whose, you know, parents have
been teachers, really believed in the
mission, but also had run big chunks of
Google, so knew how to do what I
couldn't, which is scaling from 35 to
 
transition. And and we got lucky with
Matt. Um, and I think we've gotten lucky
with Kurt, our new CEO now this time
around. But that's basically the story.
And then I was fried. Like then I just
had a year or two of just recover your
health because I pushed myself too far.
Um, you know, and you know, doctors were
telling me like, hey, if you don't stop
doing this, you're just going to die.
So,
&gt;&gt; wow.
&gt;&gt; It worked out well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then, you know, we're in a
little bit of a moment right now to
where, as Kelly tells it to me, you
know, we're homies and she texts me and
she's like, "Hey, like this place
actually like cares about people and
like they're really nice here and they
look out for each other." That doesn't
seem to be the case in Silicon Valley
anymore, especially for early stage tech
companies. Like, where does that come
from? And why have you maintained it in
a candidly in a working environment
where you probably don't need to
anymore? Okay. So, I'll give two
answers. One is like we've had to be a
good place to work because they know
like yeah, we can't offer them the same
cash that Facebook can offer them,
right? So, they it had there has to be
some fulfilling life thing of being at
Quizlet. Yes, you're dealing at big
scale solving tough technology problems,
but um also, you know, like, hey, I feel
good. I'm helping students all around
the world and they treat me well and
there's a culture of treating people
well and being collaborative that
started with our earliest hack nights
you know but here's the other thing like
we didn't start too far before Uber you
know and like just I'm not a douchebag
and Andrew wasn't a douchebag he's the
greatest guy with the greatest values he
was had great values when he was 17 he's
in his 30s now he's got good values now
like and so we just naturally did that
and if it got in the water and outlived
us, you know, he left the company a few
years ago. I'm still on the board. So,
I've been involved for a long time, but
not operationally. Like, it's just how
it kind of how it started.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm a big believer, Dave, in in
like the the power of the sustainability
of how founders start that company. use
the metaphor in the water, but I always
said and I've been a part of really
great companies with, you know, very
above board values and this or that. And
I've been a part of not great companies
with not above board values and that and
they tried to kind of band-aid it and
put lipstick on it. And I was like,
listen, you know, these companies are
almost like humans. You know, you they
they have like core personalities that
that start from everything that you do a
million times a day consistently over
time. And you can change your
personality a little bit, but you can't
really change like the core core. And I
I I really believe that. And like 18
years later, you know, I think that's
still there. Um
&gt;&gt; that was on purpose. I mean, I worked at
at Netscape and, you know, that was
pretty cutthroat and there was a lot of
polit after it got big and went public.
That's when I was there. Um, but still,
you know, decent people. There's good
people everywhere, but I I won't, you
know, the being able to bootstrap gets
you out of a situation where you're
pressurized by VCs because VCs come in
and they got a model, right? And the
model says, "Okay, we invested X, we
need at least 3X, you know, if it's
later stage by this time or we want a
 
let's monetize this. You got a lot of
users, right? Our VCs were high
integrity. Like, I don't necessarily
agree with all the decisions the
company's made over the past 10 years
since I've been CEO, but like we've made
rational ones, not crazy thrashing
around, political factions fighting.
Like, we just haven't had any of that.
And it's not so much Dan, me and Andrew,
it's like all the people who came in
around us like and in the first that
first 35 people, there were several
without whom of which like we just
wouldn't be here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'd love actually your your take
on that because I've come across this a
lot in my career in venture where there
there's a healthy tension between the
mission of the company and and why a lot
of founders started the company with the
pressure to return an ROI and the the
the business side of it if you will you
know and I remember being at GitHub
right when that was you know kind of at
full reign when it was very mission
oriented, right? We wanted, you know,
coders on Hey Ashberry and that's why
we're here and then GE comes in with a
bunch of money and they want this and
there was kind of different camps, you
know, in the company around are we
selling out if that makes sense. So, how
how have you all balanced like that that
intense missiondriven culture that I
hear about every day with the need to 3x
or 10x to your point?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So let me just say there's
also a difference between um SAS
companies which I think is most
companies that VCs fund these days and
consumer companies where SAS just comes
with a monolith like you know ARR CAC
and LTV like let's make this engine work
there's some customer lacking like when
we were doing our CEO search to find
Kurt like what became apparent is
there's just very few um non-founder
CEOs who really have experience running
consumer
startup tech companies and so it's sort
of a a whole different thing and um the
it has to be driven by passion and
vision and the business model like this
thing of free and fremium right which
VCs don't love when they hear because
it's like a free in the word and why are
we giving away this thing to all these
people free it's because you freaking
have to that's what made Google big
that's what made YouTube egg. That's
what made, you know, name your consumer
app that we're addicted to now. Um,
but at some point you also do have to
like go for the jugular and really
compete and have that DNA too. And so,
you know, I I think it's it's hard to
keep that going without a founder as the
CEO,
&gt;&gt; but we've somehow managed to do it. And
I'll credit, you know, uh, Matt who was
the CEO after me with doing it. And now
I'd say like, hey, like maybe we got a
little complacent in the past few years
and we chased some stuff which really
wasn't core to our mission and we just
thought, hey, we're a big brand. We've
got this cool thing. The students love
it. But guess what? Like it's another
moment of innovation and disruption and
we have the scale. We have the data. We
have this great team. We have all these
assets, we have uh brands, but you know
what? We got to innovate much faster.
And I think we realized this as a board
like three years ago, and that's what's
happening now. And is really cool with
more of a like go for the jugular, you
know, wartime
uh lens. And so the question is, can you
keep that and also the missiondriven
um stuff? And you know, since I'm just
on the board, I don't really have any
control over it. You do, Kelly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; More than I do. And that's why I'm
excited that you're
&gt;&gt; going to be joining full-time.
&gt;&gt; I see what you're doing. That was
brilliant.
&gt;&gt; And I mean on that though,
&gt;&gt; it's rare. I don't remember. I don't
remember if I've ever seen a venture
company that's been 18 years old.
Usually it's, you know, it goes public
or it gets sold or doesn't work out. 18
years is quite the, you know, quite the
quite the journey. Dave, that's awesome.
In those 18 years, how have you kept
competitive? Do you know what I mean?
Like what what mistakes have you all
made? What what advice do you have for
other founders that are starting
companies or, you know, two years in on
how to stay how to stay paranoid? Did
you screw up in any way?
&gt;&gt; Here's a big one. Here's a big one. Keep
your cost low. Be capital efficient. I'm
very proud of the fact that every dollar
we raised is still in the bank and more.
like we've never actually technically
needed the money we've raised. It's
still in the bank because we've been
very capital efficient. This fremium
model actually really works because the
word of mouth does the marketing for
you. You're not paying to acquire
customers. And so I would say to
entrepreneurs now like you know whether
you bootstrap for 2 months or two years
or eight years like we did try to do
that because it gives you this
discipline of capital efficiency and
keeping your cost low and like focus on
really what you need to do rather than
we have all this money we're trying all
these things and it just gives you more
runway to figure it out and to get your
DNA
um into the company. And so yeah, we
have um so come back to vision how we
last I think it's actually pretty common
for companies that turn into great
companies to be 18 years old and you can
probably name them better than I have
but like starting with Microsoft or even
Dolingo in our space which is they
didn't start too much after us right and
people are only hearing about oh my god
Dolingo now in the past five years but
it's because they spent a long time in
the wilderness like figuring out how to
innovate make their product great
understanding the market, understanding
the users.
So, I don't know if that
&gt;&gt; helps at all.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it does. Um,
&gt;&gt; it's a very big world is the other
thing. And the whole thing with scale
and technology is there's different like
thresholds where okay, now we're at the
scale where we can do XYZ. And then you
get to the next scale and it's like
okay, we can be much more ambitious
international as an example. So, I don't
think there's a limit to to what Quizlet
can do. I think we're kind of just still
near the start.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just like earning the right
to solve the next problem, right? And
like you guys are figuring out as you go
along. All right, we start here and this
is what we're doing and then you kind of
just like continue to grow. But to
Kelly's point, 18 years is a long time
for uh you know, for how much did you
say you raised, Dave? 50 million.
&gt;&gt; Uh it's a little bit north of that, but
not much north of that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, and so what's so what what's
the pitch to candidates then, right?
Because like you know that what's the
pitch to candidates? Because like if I'm
a candidate
&gt;&gt; like and you're giving me equity, I'm
thinking about like what's my liquidity
path?
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, Kelly, you want to do
the pitch?
&gt;&gt; Well, this is where this is where the
mission this is where that's the real
talk of the missiondriven
question connected with the ROI, you
know, and
&gt;&gt; not the mission driven. The
missiondriven is good, but you can make
a lot of money if you start at Quizlet
now and get options at the current
price. Like this thing can grow 10x 20
 
the business plan we have. It's a very
big world. Um we are you know very
strong in the US. We're a little bit
underpenetrated internationally. We have
a frequency opportunity which is what
like right now a lot of students use us
for one subject and we can get them
using us for you know more than one
subject once a week rather than once
once a month once a day rather than once
a week. Um and so uh and this has also
become like what people do that this
generation it was true of even the you
know there's kids who started using
Wizard who are fully grown up in their
 
now it's just like everybody's doing
everything on their phones like why
shouldn't we be the thing that you're
&gt;&gt; 100% but but is it a public path is it
an M&amp;A path is it a secondary path like
what like if I joined
&gt;&gt; but Nolan every company I've joined
they're not no one said this is what
we're going to do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's 18 years in is the
difference.
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. It's It's going to be
big,
&gt;&gt; you know, from here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but
&gt;&gt; look at Nvidia's stock price, right?
Like how how long did Nvidia go before
it hit this AI thing? And
&gt;&gt; but it's been public for a long time. My
my point is just a time time to
liquidity, which is I think a lot of
people like a lot of people now given
that we we have lived through this age
of startups, it takes longer than
anybody thinks. Like everybody's aligned
with that now. Um
&gt;&gt; there is this whole secondary thing and
we've done some of those you know we've
got a couple attenders
&gt;&gt; I forget the exact you know few years
ago another one and so there is that
&gt;&gt; well if you're going to take employees
with you on a you know 26 mile 26 year
 
liquidity events you have to have
secondaries that's my question but the
other thing and I'll be really honest
about this this might be helpful to
people that are listening you know it's
a blood bath out there right now there's
layoff every other week. SAS companies
are going under. You got AI companies
that are raising this and to your point
Dave maybe pissing it away and being
irresponsible in this frenzy. Quizlet is
like the responsible parent. It is like
the the tons of money in the bank,
making money, growing.
&gt;&gt; That's that's the key what you just
said. Like the fact that we have a lot
of money in the bank, that's fine.
That's good. We're not burning money.
We're a cash flow positive pretty
significantly, right? So, we can still
invest heavily in the business. We're
going to be around and we have the
staying power to be in the game. Like
most of these entrepreneurs have gone
into education, they shake out. They got
acquired. We just had this big meltdown
with company that should not be named
Che, you know, which went public,
&gt;&gt; made all these acquisitions and then
just
&gt;&gt; I had two friends that work there. Two
friends that got impacted by working
there 100%. will tell you that in 2012
the CEO who I will not name called us in
and like I went with one of our
engineers and he's like you should sell
to us you know for half a million
dollars otherwise we're going to
steamroll you and I holy
&gt;&gt; dude like we're going to steamroll you
&gt;&gt; a t-shirt and a hat we're gonna
steamroll
&gt;&gt; what yeah
&gt;&gt; you made a t-shirt but the other thing
is for those of you I mean th those
things as well Dave but also the upside
Nolan like I will tell tell you. I'm not
going to give away all the numbers here,
but I haven't seen a venture company
this this late in the game that's
there's actually a low for an NA.
There's a lot of money in the bank. It's
series C. I mean, it's it's a it's not
your usual resume on paper that you
would you would look at. So, you have to
look at all those components. I guess
we'll end off on a question I have is
where where is Andrew now, Dave? Your
teenage co-founder. What's he doing? He
is, I believe, in San Diego working on a
really cool math um software startup
that I I don't know a lot about it that
caters to um like very sophisticated
math like the folks who like compete for
these international prizes. And you
know, I think he's done a bunch of cool
things. you know, I don't talk to him a
lot, but every once in a while he's done
a bunch of cool things on um the sort of
Yimi movement and trying to get sort of
development of housing going faster and
community stuff. He was always into
that. And in fact, like the very first
money that ever came into Quizlet was a
donation thing for a Katrina hurricane
or follow on from that. um that cuz he
had gone and spent a summer in high
school doing Katrina cleanup. There was
the first thing what turned into Quizlet
Plus was like this donation to the Red
Cross. Um, and then we kind of realized,
yeah, we probably need another revenue
model other than ads, which weren't
adwords at the time, and ads, you know,
and so we started having Quizlet Plus
where you got no ads for like $10 a
year, and then we upped it to 15 and you
could add images to your study sets. Um,
&gt;&gt; but yeah, he's just he's doing cool
stuff.
&gt;&gt; Awesome. I can't thank you enough for
coming on here, Dave. It is a very
unique origin story and just a unique
profile company, Nolan. So hopefully
everyone took something away and really
appreciate it.
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for having
&gt;&gt; Thanks for telling us the story, Dave.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right, take care.
