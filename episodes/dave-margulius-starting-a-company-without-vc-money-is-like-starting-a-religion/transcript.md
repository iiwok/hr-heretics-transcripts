&gt;&gt; I didn't want to do VC like we didn't
actually need to. We could have
 
actually need to. We could have
bootstrapped it.
 
bootstrapped it.
&gt;&gt; Um and I'd seen the movie, right? I
 
&gt;&gt; Um and I'd seen the movie, right? I
didn't want to do that movie. As it
 
didn't want to do that movie. As it
turned out, we had bootstrapped enough
 
turned out, we had bootstrapped enough
for long enough and built something
 
for long enough and built something
strong enough that we could handpick our
 
strong enough that we could handpick our
VCs and we ended up we did end up
 
VCs and we ended up we did end up
needing the money because we were like
 
needing the money because we were like
we had the footprint of Taco Bell with

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then, you know, we're in a
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then, you know, we're in a
little bit of a moment right now to
 
little bit of a moment right now to
where, as Kelly tells it to me, you
 
where, as Kelly tells it to me, you

seem to be the case in Silicon Valley
anymore, especially for early stage tech
 
anymore, especially for early stage tech
companies. Like, where does that come
 
companies. Like, where does that come
from? And why have you maintained it in
 
from? And why have you maintained it in
a candidly in a working environment
 
a candidly in a working environment
where you probably don't need to
 
where you probably don't need to
anymore? Okay. So, I'll give two
 
anymore? Okay. So, I'll give two
answers. One is like we've had to be a
 
answers. One is like we've had to be a
good place to work because they know

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'd love actually your your take
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'd love actually your your take
on that because I've come across this a
 
on that because I've come across this a
lot in my career in venture where there

intense missiondriven culture that I
 
intense missiondriven culture that I
hear about every day with the need to 3x
 
hear about every day with the need to 3x
or 10x to your point?
 
or 10x to your point?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So let me just say there's

like we've never actually technically
 
like we've never actually technically
needed the money we've raised. It's
 
needed the money we've raised. It's
still in the bank because we've been
 
still in the bank because we've been

keeping your cost low and like focus on
 
keeping your cost low and like focus on
really what you need to do rather than
 
really what you need to do rather than
we have all this money we're trying all
