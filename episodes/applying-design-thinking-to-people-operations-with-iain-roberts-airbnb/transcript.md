is it so difficult for organizations to

get those new ideas through themselves
and out into the world? And so for that
and out into the world? And so for that

second decade, I spent much more time

constantly shaping the environment and
constantly shaping the environment and
 
constantly shaping the environment and
the systems around us. At the end of the

Airbnb is just 7,000 people, right? All
Airbnb is just 7,000 people, right? All
 
Airbnb is just 7,000 people, right? All
we have is 7,000 people. And so the
we have is 7,000 people. And so the
 
we have is 7,000 people. And so the
design effort here is designing the
design effort here is designing the
 
design effort here is designing the
system of the right people working on
system of the right people working on
 
system of the right people working on
the right things in the right way in the
the right things in the right way in the
 
the right things in the right way in the
right organizational structures. That's
right organizational structures. That's
 
right organizational structures. That's
the entire ball game. It's a massive and
the entire ball game. It's a massive and
 
the entire ball game. It's a massive and
in a huge design challenge and one that
in a huge design challenge and one that
 
in a huge design challenge and one that
I'm incredibly privileged to have the
I'm incredibly privileged to have the
 
I'm incredibly privileged to have the
opportunity to work on. So, let's talk a
opportunity to work on. So, let's talk a
 
opportunity to work on. So, let's talk a
little bit about Brian's comments
little bit about Brian's comments
 
little bit about Brian's comments
regarding founder mode. So, my read was
regarding founder mode. So, my read was
 
regarding founder mode. So, my read was
essentially the traditional advice when
essentially the traditional advice when
 
essentially the traditional advice when
you hire an executive is you hire that
you hire an executive is you hire that
 
you hire an executive is you hire that
person and then you just get out of
person and then you just get out of
 
person and then you just get out of
their way and you let them operate.
their way and you let them operate.
 
their way and you let them operate.
Brian's view on that traditional advice
Brian's view on that traditional advice
 
Brian's view on that traditional advice
is that it's broken and it's broken
is that it's broken and it's broken
 
is that it's broken and it's broken
because
because
 
because
they can be off doing stuff that you're
they can be off doing stuff that you're
 
they can be off doing stuff that you're
not aware of and you're misaligned with.
not aware of and you're misaligned with.
 
not aware of and you're misaligned with.
And so Brian's also talked a little bit
And so Brian's also talked a little bit
 
And so Brian's also talked a little bit
about being in the details. Do I have
about being in the details. Do I have
 
about being in the details. Do I have
that right? It's a much debated topic,
that right? It's a much debated topic,
 
that right? It's a much debated topic,
right? And I think it has been a much
right? And I think it has been a much
 
right? And I think it has been a much
misinterpreted topic. Right. I think one
misinterpreted topic. Right. I think one
 
misinterpreted topic. Right. I think one
of the things Brian talks about is this
of the things Brian talks about is this
 
of the things Brian talks about is this
idea that leadership should be defined
idea that leadership should be defined
 
idea that leadership should be defined
in in its presence, not in its absence.
in in its presence, not in its absence.
 
in in its presence, not in its absence.
And for me what I found in working with
And for me what I found in working with
 
And for me what I found in working with
Brian is he leads like a designer.
Brian is he leads like a designer.
 
Brian is he leads like a designer.
Right? What does that mean? It means he
Right? What does that mean? It means he
 
Right? What does that mean? It means he
is highly collaborative in the way that
is highly collaborative in the way that
 
is highly collaborative in the way that
he wants to work through problems.
he wants to work through problems.
 
he wants to work through problems.
Right? Because innately in design is
Right? Because innately in design is
 
Right? Because innately in design is
this idea of interdicciplinary
this idea of interdicciplinary
 
this idea of interdicciplinary
collaboration. Teams always being better
collaboration. Teams always being better
 
collaboration. Teams always being better
at getting to the outcome that you want
at getting to the outcome that you want
 
at getting to the outcome that you want
than any one individual. And that can be
than any one individual. And that can be
 
than any one individual. And that can be
challenging to some people, right, who
challenging to some people, right, who
 
challenging to some people, right, who
are used to being given the autonomy and
are used to being given the autonomy and
 
are used to being given the autonomy and
the mandate to go off and do the thing
the mandate to go off and do the thing
 
the mandate to go off and do the thing
and bring back the answer. Whereas
and bring back the answer. Whereas
 
and bring back the answer. Whereas
actually how I found Brian really wants
actually how I found Brian really wants
 
actually how I found Brian really wants
to work is he genuinely wants to roll up
to work is he genuinely wants to roll up
 
to work is he genuinely wants to roll up
his sleeves and sit down next to you and
his sleeves and sit down next to you and
 
his sleeves and sit down next to you and
work through problems together. And
work through problems together. And
 
work through problems together. And
that's what it means to be in the
that's what it means to be in the
 
that's what it means to be in the
details. And so the idea Nolan of like
details. And so the idea Nolan of like
 
details. And so the idea Nolan of like
frequent iteration touch points that
frequent iteration touch points that
 
frequent iteration touch points that
you're talking about, that's a design
you're talking about, that's a design
 
you're talking about, that's a design
practice as well. It's called
practice as well. It's called
 
practice as well. It's called
prototyping and iterating. And so my
prototyping and iterating. And so my
 
prototyping and iterating. And so my
experience of working with Brian is
experience of working with Brian is
 
experience of working with Brian is
exactly that. How do I get to be at the
exactly that. How do I get to be at the
 
exactly that. How do I get to be at the
same side of the table as him with my
same side of the table as him with my
 
same side of the table as him with my
sleeves rolled up collaborating on
sleeves rolled up collaborating on
 
sleeves rolled up collaborating on
problems together? Yeah. You're talking
problems together? Yeah. You're talking
 
problems together? Yeah. You're talking
about micromanaging, right? And and so
about micromanaging, right? And and so
 
about micromanaging, right? And and so
this one's been in the oven for a little
this one's been in the oven for a little
 
this one's been in the oven for a little
while for me since it came out. And the
while for me since it came out. And the
 
while for me since it came out. And the
weaponization is micromanagement, right?
weaponization is micromanagement, right?
 
weaponization is micromanagement, right?
It's like the CEO is up your ass and
