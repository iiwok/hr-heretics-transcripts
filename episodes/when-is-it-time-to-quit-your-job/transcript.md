hey what's up everybody Welcome Back To
HR Heretics today we're going to do a
segment on leaving your job so Kelly I'm
going to be honest uh this has not been
an area of strength for me in the past
um I've had some really hard lessons on
what not to do um candidly it's like one
of those things that we should teach in
school is like leaving is a really
important skill and no one actually like
teaches you how to do it the right way
uh like when my parents leave parties
they always like Irish goodbye um so I
think that was kind of like part of my
upbringing that's where you learn that's
where you learned it yeah learn skill
right uh so I want to First actually go
back to like how do you know it's time
and and you know going back in your
career Kelly like when have you felt
like it's time to start looking for a
new opportunity yeah it's such an
important conversation and you're right
we don't have it enough we have tons of
Chats on how to get a job and negotiate
and on board not a lot about leaving and
it's funny I just talked to someone
driving home from a meeting on the car
and gave them advice on this like very
thing which I have to be honest it's
kind of natural to me I feel like I'm
pretty good at it so I love that you
said you're not good at it and I'd love
to understand more about why and of
course we're not talking about leaving
in terms of you know getting terminated
or laid off for whatever we're talking
about quitting and
resigning um and so to answer your
question like when do you know it's time
I'd love to hear your view on that Nolan
but for me you know I kind of know it's
time
when and and you know we call this
podcast to be real and everyone always
says when I stop learning or when I like
like come on like yes but I know it's
time when I wake up in the morning and
I'm like oh my God I don't want to go to
this meeting I don't I don't want to do
today like because I I'm one of those
you know masochists that really love
this job and love the intensity and love
the stress and love and for me it's more
of like when I'm dreading the day and
it's sucking energy for me I know it's
kind of time and some of that might be
boredom or maybe I'm not learning sure
but I think we should dig into the real
nature of like when is it freaking time
without the usual fluff of I'm not
learning anymore totally so I there's
like a couple heris sixs that I use um
one is that you know you're describing
energy and I I actually like to do
energy audits so even if you're working
on something really hard but if you get
energized by that thing like that's a
good thing versus you know what you just
described is like the energy suck to
where like every day you're like
dreading it or like you're just so
exhausted not because of like you know
your brain's been firing on every
cylinder but because you're just
tired of and you know what
gives you energy and figuring out what
gives you energy I think is like a
really important heris um you know I
think it was Michelle Weaver that said
you should be running to something yes
and I've thought a lot about that since
she said it and I think it's such a good
one um and so you know the running to
something thing I would frame underneath
the you should just always be having
conversations always be building your
network always just be open to
conversations like when recruiters reach
out take the call like be curious about
what's going on um but don't just you
know you you can't have one foot in your
current job and then one foot in like
the job search Mark I think that's a
terrible way to do it yeah um but I do
think just being open to things and so
if you feel like you're running towards
something and you're you know you feel
that energy like that that's a good
heris as well um I know you said like
the the learning thing is is a little
bit trite but like I don't know I I
actually it matters to me like that's
one of that's one of the poor ones for
me is is learning an impact I just
wanted I guess for me it's it's just
let's dig into what exactly that means
more than just say you know I'm not
learning because I do think there are
Shades of Gray in that you know what I
mean and and back to what Michelle said
Michelle Weaver um on on that
episode you know I've seen one one
Pitfall in that running to something H
people will stay in their jobs and be
miserable you know because they're
waiting until they're run to something
and I'm not saying you should just leave
and because a lot of people myself
included a certain time couldn't afford
to like wait and not work until
something comes along where you're
running to it you know what I mean so
but it's a dangerous slope you just have
to be aware that if you're going to stay
in your role that you're unhappy and
miserable just be careful not to shoot
yourself in the foot because I believe
if you stay in a role for a long time
like that it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy and you
become not great anymore right and that
just backfires on yourself and so you
just have to be aware and I'll end by
saying the best way to defend against
any of that is to do exactly what you
said which is not feel bad about having
conversations about talking to
recruiters about testing your value and
your market value
and a lot of people feel bad about
taking calls and it's like no you don't
have to want to leave to take calls it's
the best way to smooth things out and
and when a time does come those those
things will kind of merge together
versus forcing it if that makes sense
yeah I say this term all the time but
it's it it helps expand your surface
area of luck if you never take calls
from recruiters then you know by
definition your surface area is are much
smaller but if you you know meet a
recruiter and they pitch a rooll to you
and it's not fit for you well you could
actually still be a creative in the
relationship by maybe leveraging your
network and referring other people and
then they start thinking about you more
so it's not all Zero Sum in recruiting
and I think people don't think about it
as as nuanced as it possibly could be
taking uh one quick step back where we
should have started is it's bespoke like
this is you know everybody's in
different situations I I've said this a
million times on the show like I grew up
in a in household that didn't have any
money like my electricity got shut off
as a kid when I got my first job it was
like I must keep this job and like I
need to like do everything I can to
absolutely kill it here and so just
understanding that like you know having
a your Finance situation first dialed in
is like thing number one but actually
like what I learned is as my boss moved
over to Google you know and I was
exploring that opportunity once he got
there it's like because I took that call
from him and because I was open to that
then had the opportunity to kind of get
a promotion when I left that job um and
so I think another humoristic is it's
not just about money but it's like if
you can like change levels and if you
could change uh your your ownership and
what you're working on to have it be a
bigger scope that's another thing for me
that I've always
factored hey everyone we'll be right

Heretics here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience

connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics say
 
you right what which to my earlier point
is a is a double click on learning right
that that that for me is a is a very
pertinent example of learning and I you
know I think tenure also is something to
look at you know I remember back in
 
chat with a friend at Yahoo and I'm like
listen you've been here nine years um
it's not that big of a company at this
point like what what how are you doing
new things stretching to your point
learning um and and then there's the
people that don't want to and it's like
hey we should celebrate those that are
like I I'm not necessarily learning but
I love what I'm doing and it goes back
to Clarity of identity who who are you
what do you want what are you trying to
do well we should also be clear though
that you just brought up a really good
point around tenure and I was thinking
initially around job hoppiness but what
I want to say first is like there's
actually a barbell issue there so on one
side everyone knows job hoppy don't want
to be job hoppy which is generally like
you know don't leave a job within 18
months 18 to 24 months roughly but then
there's the other end of the barbell
which is like you know we all tell
ourselves stories when we don't have
information on somebody and what
recruiters do when they look at your
profile and if you've gone from job to
job to job to job every six to 18 months
your job hooby but if you've only been
at a place for 10 years then the the
other story that they tell is is like
well you know they're just resting and
vesting they're coasting they're not
learning anything anymore and and this
is where you just have to be aware of
the potential narratives about you
versus like complaining about what those
narratives might be you have to be aware
of them so then you could speak to them
when the time is right for you to start
exploring New Opportunities yes yes uh
we just talked about this yesterday on
our segment on back channels yeah
context is everything um making you know
just sweep Jud judgements based on
something very surface level is not like
I just talked to someone last week and
they had been in a company for double
digit years and they said you know every
year it was like a new company great how
you know how did the role change how did
the skills grow how did the challenges
differ uh and I do believe that I
believe companies can change and but so
the narratives are are not complete with
hoppiness or your stale because you've
been there for nine years but you have
to be able to describe it to the lowest
level of detail and and that's where I
think people go wrong okay second thing
I want to talk about is how do you put
in notice so Kelly what's your strategy
with putting in notice yeah look I I've
always been really really loyal um and
the notices have always been long you
know it's always been kind of this phase
planned approach I I don't think I've
ever given two weeks notice in my career
or even a month I mean my notice at
hired I believe was seven months
notice um now let's talk about what has
to be true you know we've talked about
this before with succession planning it
has to be a safe environment where
people are mature and you trust them and
you're like noan you're not going to be
here forever what do you thinking well I
think in eight months it's probably time
great let's start having a conversation
where I can trust you that's just
between us and we start stealthly
working backwards from those eight
months and planning business continuity
career path in for others succession
planning for you that that is the best
way to do this um the worst way to do it
is I'm giving you two weeks I'm leaving
and you're caught flat-footed you're
probably angry you're panicking um
there's no succession planning the
business is going to be at risk because
of it and I just want to talk about the
reasons that caused that and I do we've
talked about this before I believe it
goes back to fear of security and
repercussion if I put my cards on the
table and get bit
and so theistic here is the relationship
with your manager and your leadership
team that's correct and so if we're
giving advice to people that uh you know
I'm putting in notice I would say you
know obviously this is you're worried
about your life you're worried about
like your relationship with your manager
you're worried about like getting off on
the right foot you know with the next
place you're worried about like you know
in Kelly's situation if she's talking
eight months in advance she's not like
interviewing right now
um she's not ready to jump out the door
right now right but like that requires a
a deep level of trust with management
and so you have to be very thoughtful if
you're putting in advanced notice now on
the other end of the
spectrum um you know if you don't have
that relationship with your manager I I
do think sometimes even though it's not
great two weeks notice is fine I mean
that is what the industry standard is we
hope that you have a better relationship
with your manager so you can have a
series of conversations about what works
great for you and how that can work
great for the company but the reality is
is if you have hesitation then my
feedback to you would be give the
standard two weeks yeah and my two ads
to that is again don't be naive don't
say well I'm giving you six months
because and not be aware that maybe you
don't have a good relationship or again
I'm going to be real what is the
perspective and perception of your
performance and your impact to the
company because if it's not like good to
great at least good hopefully great
they're going to be like thanks Nolan
for the six months but you can you can
go you can go in two months I mean two
weeks and you might be like oops well I
don't want so that actually happened to
me so that's incredible it's incredible
when I left when I left uh Google I gave
four weeks notice and I had a vesting
day on the Wednesday before the Friday I
wanted to leave and I thought I had a
great relationship
and um you know I I thought like
everyone you know I was going to Door
Dash it was like a bigger opportunity
for me I thought everybody understood
they walked me out on the Monday before
the Wednesday so I didn't get that vest
and it was I I'll be candid with the
audience it was
$10,000 which still is a big deal to me
at that time that was like more money
than I had ever seen and that one really
hurt now we're almost 10 years removed
from that and what I tell people is I
wouldn't change anything about it even
though I got screwed I actually feel
like I did the right thing I wanted to
give the team notice I gave the team
plenty of notice I ended like those
relationships at least from my side of
the table I feel very proud of um but I
did get taken advantage of that
situation and so like if you have
vesting coming up you know if you have
like big Financial Milestones that are
you know around the corner you do need
to protect yourself or at least factor
that into your decision making hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after a word from our sponsors Real Talk
most Talent leaders haven't yet cracked
how to leverage AI for Meaningful impact
on their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting teams efficiency and quality
use metaview metaview is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
candidates during calls and save time on
the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a time saer because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline hiring teams
can make confident informed decisions
and talent leaders can finally take
control of the interview process join
Forward Thinking Talent leaders at high
performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and quora and check out
metaview head over to metav vi. a/h
Heretics to talk to one of metav VI's
product experts or get started for free
you'll be UPR running an AI enabled in
minutes it's a great point and I I I am
very perturbed that that is an awful
thing to do like I don't think I've ever
once done that or thought about that in
fact it's been like hey you're giving
notice even if it's four weeks and we
don't need you you honor that and keep
the vest seen like that that is just the
poorest form ever but I but I do have a
lot of conversations and people ask me
for a lot of advice like hey I'm going
to give notice I have this vesting I
have a bonus coming up like how should I
think about that and it's not a One-Stop
shop with one answer yeah and and you
just you know you have to um you have to
always remember it's a business on the
other side of the table and so I take
full ownership for doing it the way that
I did um and again I would I wouldn't
change it now that's you know that's
coming from a very privileged
perspective that I have today and so you
just need to be able to think about
yourself number one because the business
is always going to think about itself as
the number one priority not about you I
hope they would change it that is I I
know it's not it's not great but look I
just it's a it's a lesson that I've
given um many people who have asked me
about after the fact okay uh let's shift
gears into okay great you've put in
notice you've transitioned out um how do
you think about maintaining
relationships at the company that you
just
left yeah uh it's a great a great point
because it's easy just to kind of stop
and move on um to be very tactful I will
literally put a monthly calendar invite
in my calendar to reach out to you know
I I would say cap it at 10 if if I have
a thousand person company probably 10
people a month and it doesn't have to be
a b a thing it's just like hey texting
how's it going you guys need anything
you all need anything any any help any
any advice I'm here and sometimes they
don't usually don't they won't need
anything touch points are really
important it's not dis in genuine you
kind of miss those people usually you
know when you're going so I just forget
it's not that I don't want to I just
forget so I I literally use my calendar
and I will say you know reach out to
Todd right I'm talking with Todd next
week in San
Francisco for the audience so that's the
CEO of pendo right so that's that's not
only just like somebody who Kelly worked
with that's who Kelly reported to um so
this is this is the area that I am most
embarrassed of in my career I mean this
is this is a great episode you should
just get horizontal on the couch and I
feel like I am like have a tissue
box so this is the area that I I am like
so embarrassed about and the reason why
is because um you know the story I told
myself specifically with uh actually I
guess with both direct reports and to
people that I reported to but more so
with my direct reports it's like I
didn't want to be that person who left
and was like oh hey how are things going
like let's go get coffee and like give
me the dirt it just feels
like it it feels so like High
schoolly um that what I when I told my
directs I was like hey I you know when I
leave like I I don't I'm not going to
like Ping you all the time like you ping
me if you ever need
anything and uh one of my directs I'll
shout her out Talen
um gave me really good feedback a couple
of years ago she was like that was
terrible and she's like I needed you to
like check in on me to like see how I
was doing and it didn't have to be like
you know you were like all up in my
business all the time and she was
totally right like there's Nuance there
I I like the monthly one probably you
know I think for me the right Cadence
would have been like every 8 to 12 weeks
um but just less so about how the
business is doing and like how things
are without you and and more so about
how that person is doing yeah for
maintaining those
ties um yeah I just I I didn't have the
ability to to delineate what was
happening in the business in my
relationship with the people who worked
at that business yeah and for me it was
it wasn't didn't seem unnatural for I
mean these are people that you talk to
usually two to three times a day every
day exactly so once a month I mean it's
like hey how's the fam what's going on
how's the how's coming you know it's
it's you miss these people it's I mean
it's it is human nature so yeah for sure
so uh be more like Kelly on this one
definitely do not be more like me um but
I have learned and and I old yeah
exactly and this you know to our Point
um you know in one of our last segments
is like people learn people grow you
learn from your mistakes and one of the
things that we're committed to doing on
this show is being super candid about
those so you don't make the same
mistakes that we made love it cool all
right let us know what you guys think
all right thanks
