she said it and I think it's such a good
one um and so you know the running to
 
one um and so you know the running to
something thing I would frame underneath
 
something thing I would frame underneath
the you should just always be having
 
the you should just always be having
conversations always be building your
 
conversations always be building your
network always just be open to
 
network always just be open to
conversations like when recruiters reach
 
conversations like when recruiters reach
out take the call like be curious about
 
out take the call like be curious about
what's going on um but don't just you
 
what's going on um but don't just you

know you you can't have one foot in your
current job and then one foot in like
 
current job and then one foot in like

the job search Mark I think that's a
terrible way to do it yeah um but I do
 
terrible way to do it yeah um but I do
think just being open to things and so
 
think just being open to things and so
if you feel like you're running towards
 
if you feel like you're running towards
something and you're you know you feel
 
something and you're you know you feel
that energy like that that's a good
 
that energy like that that's a good
heris as well um I know you said like
 
heris as well um I know you said like
the the learning thing is is a little
 
the the learning thing is is a little
bit trite but like I don't know I I
 
bit trite but like I don't know I I
actually it matters to me like that's
 
actually it matters to me like that's
one of that's one of the poor ones for
 
one of that's one of the poor ones for
me is is learning an impact I just
 
me is is learning an impact I just
wanted I guess for me it's it's just
 
wanted I guess for me it's it's just
let's dig into what exactly that means
 
let's dig into what exactly that means
more than just say you know I'm not
 
more than just say you know I'm not
learning because I do think there are
 
learning because I do think there are
Shades of Gray in that you know what I
 
Shades of Gray in that you know what I
mean and and back to what Michelle said
 
mean and and back to what Michelle said
Michelle Weaver um on on that
 
Michelle Weaver um on on that
episode you know I've seen one one
 
episode you know I've seen one one
Pitfall in that running to something H
 
Pitfall in that running to something H
people will stay in their jobs and be
 
people will stay in their jobs and be
miserable you know because they're
 
miserable you know because they're
waiting until they're run to something
 
waiting until they're run to something
and I'm not saying you should just leave
 
and I'm not saying you should just leave
and because a lot of people myself
 
and because a lot of people myself
included a certain time couldn't afford
 
included a certain time couldn't afford
to like wait and not work until
 
to like wait and not work until
something comes along where you're
 
something comes along where you're
running to it you know what I mean so
 
running to it you know what I mean so
but it's a dangerous slope you just have
 
but it's a dangerous slope you just have
to be aware that if you're going to stay
 
to be aware that if you're going to stay
in your role that you're unhappy and
 
in your role that you're unhappy and
miserable just be careful not to shoot
 
miserable just be careful not to shoot
yourself in the foot because I believe
 
yourself in the foot because I believe
if you stay in a role for a long time
 
if you stay in a role for a long time
like that it becomes a self-fulfilling
 
like that it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy and you
 
prophecy and you
become not great anymore right and that
 
become not great anymore right and that
just backfires on yourself and so you
 
just backfires on yourself and so you
just have to be aware and I'll end by
 
just have to be aware and I'll end by
saying the best way to defend against
 
saying the best way to defend against
any of that is to do exactly what you
 
any of that is to do exactly what you
said which is not feel bad about having
 
said which is not feel bad about having
conversations about talking to
 
conversations about talking to
recruiters about testing your value and
 
recruiters about testing your value and
your market value
 
your market value
and a lot of people feel bad about
 
and a lot of people feel bad about
taking calls and it's like no you don't
 
taking calls and it's like no you don't
have to want to leave to take calls it's
 
have to want to leave to take calls it's
the best way to smooth things out and
 
the best way to smooth things out and
and when a time does come those those
 
and when a time does come those those
things will kind of merge together
 
things will kind of merge together
versus forcing it if that makes sense
 
versus forcing it if that makes sense
yeah I say this term all the time but
 
yeah I say this term all the time but
it's it it helps expand your surface
 
it's it it helps expand your surface
area of luck if you never take calls
 
area of luck if you never take calls
from recruiters then you know by
 
from recruiters then you know by
definition your surface area is are much
 
definition your surface area is are much
smaller but if you you know meet a
 
smaller but if you you know meet a
recruiter and they pitch a rooll to you
 
recruiter and they pitch a rooll to you
and it's not fit for you well you could
 
and it's not fit for you well you could
actually still be a creative in the
 
actually still be a creative in the
relationship by maybe leveraging your
 
relationship by maybe leveraging your
network and referring other people and
 
network and referring other people and
then they start thinking about you more
 
then they start thinking about you more
so it's not all Zero Sum in recruiting
 
so it's not all Zero Sum in recruiting
and I think people don't think about it
 
and I think people don't think about it
as as nuanced as it possibly could be
 
as as nuanced as it possibly could be
taking uh one quick step back where we
 
taking uh one quick step back where we
should have started is it's bespoke like
 
should have started is it's bespoke like
this is you know everybody's in
 
this is you know everybody's in
different situations I I've said this a
 
different situations I I've said this a
million times on the show like I grew up
 
million times on the show like I grew up
in a in household that didn't have any
 
in a in household that didn't have any
money like my electricity got shut off
 
money like my electricity got shut off
as a kid when I got my first job it was
 
as a kid when I got my first job it was
like I must keep this job and like I
 
like I must keep this job and like I
need to like do everything I can to
 
need to like do everything I can to
absolutely kill it here and so just
 
absolutely kill it here and so just
understanding that like you know having
 
understanding that like you know having
a your Finance situation first dialed in
 
a your Finance situation first dialed in
is like thing number one but actually
 
is like thing number one but actually
like what I learned is as my boss moved
 
like what I learned is as my boss moved
over to Google you know and I was
 
over to Google you know and I was
exploring that opportunity once he got
 
exploring that opportunity once he got
there it's like because I took that call
 
there it's like because I took that call
from him and because I was open to that
 
from him and because I was open to that
then had the opportunity to kind of get
 
then had the opportunity to kind of get
a promotion when I left that job um and
 
a promotion when I left that job um and
so I think another humoristic is it's
 
so I think another humoristic is it's
not just about money but it's like if
 
not just about money but it's like if
you can like change levels and if you
 
you can like change levels and if you
could change uh your your ownership and
 
could change uh your your ownership and
what you're working on to have it be a
 
what you're working on to have it be a

hey we should celebrate those that are
 
hey we should celebrate those that are

that you just brought up a really good
point around tenure and I was thinking
 
point around tenure and I was thinking
initially around job hoppiness but what
 
initially around job hoppiness but what
I want to say first is like there's
 
I want to say first is like there's
actually a barbell issue there so on one
 
actually a barbell issue there so on one
side everyone knows job hoppy don't want
 
side everyone knows job hoppy don't want
to be job hoppy which is generally like
 
to be job hoppy which is generally like
you know don't leave a job within 18
 
you know don't leave a job within 18
months 18 to 24 months roughly but then
 
months 18 to 24 months roughly but then
there's the other end of the barbell
 
there's the other end of the barbell
which is like you know we all tell
 
which is like you know we all tell
ourselves stories when we don't have
 
ourselves stories when we don't have
information on somebody and what
 
information on somebody and what
recruiters do when they look at your
 
recruiters do when they look at your
profile and if you've gone from job to
 
profile and if you've gone from job to
job to job to job every six to 18 months
 
job to job to job every six to 18 months
your job hooby but if you've only been
 
your job hooby but if you've only been
at a place for 10 years then the the
 
at a place for 10 years then the the
other story that they tell is is like
 
other story that they tell is is like
well you know they're just resting and
 
well you know they're just resting and
vesting they're coasting they're not
 
vesting they're coasting they're not
learning anything anymore and and this
 
learning anything anymore and and this
is where you just have to be aware of
 
is where you just have to be aware of
the potential narratives about you
 
the potential narratives about you
versus like complaining about what those
 
versus like complaining about what those
narratives might be you have to be aware
 
narratives might be you have to be aware
