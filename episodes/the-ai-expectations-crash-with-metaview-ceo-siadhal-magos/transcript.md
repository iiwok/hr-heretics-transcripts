What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
are back with our AI segments with our
boy Scos from Metaview. What's up Sy?
How are you man?
&gt;&gt; I'm really good. How you doing?
&gt;&gt; I'm doing great man. Okay, so today
we're going to talk about I think the
thing that everyone's feeling and now
we're starting to see some like news
stories about it. I am certainly hearing
about it all the time. I know Kelly is
like, you know, standing on her soap box
talking about this at the dinners we've
recently had. And it's called the trough
of disillusionment. So um there is a
there's a chart which basically starts
off as like the innovation trigger and
the expectations go up, right? Then when
expectations go up then all of a sudden
like the reality of the products
delivering on those expectations is not
met. And so this is the trough of
disillusionment where we currently are.
Then it typically goes back up and you
hit the plateau of productivity which is
what everybody really wants with AI is
like they want to get value out of the
thing. But today there is a delta
between what most product providers are
selling and what the youu end users are
see. So Kelly our dinner a couple weeks
ago we're in SF and I think you had said
something along the lines of like what
are people doing here? Like how are you
actually doing it? Right, Kelly? So I
don't want to speak for you. This is
kind of your deal. What were you saying
at dinner?
Um, yeah. Look, I I think, you know, we
like to take a kind of a humorous bent
on this as well, Sle, but I was kind of
like, listen, I I've known a couple of
you around the table for at least 15, 16
years, and we've been masochistically
doing this job, you know, over and over.
And I'm like, I just want to know.
There's a lot of chatter. We talk about
all the great tools like metav, you
know, there's a ton of great stuff going
on out there and expectations and a lot
of people are feeling this pressure to
be AI native overnight. And I just
looked at these veterans and I said,
"Tell me what's going on. Tell me how
your laptop looks every day. Like take
me into your daily thing because I've
got, you know, four to six tabs up, you
know, whether it's a platform like Vetiv
or Gamma or ChatGpt." And I said, "What
tabs do you have open? And how are you
using them? And is it distracting? Is it
too much?" And they go, "It's so much. I
don't do shit."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; They don't do anything.
&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt; that was that's what blew me away, too.
&gt;&gt; No. And it was my hypothesis. You know
what I mean? And I was like, "Okay,
let's just" and it's it's becoming um
very overwhelming to people because it's
this it's this interesting paradox of
feeling so anxious that you have to know
it all and learn and spend all day doing
it and then that taking away with
executing on the day-to-day and being an
operator. And ideally, those things
obviously go together, but I think part
of this is going to take a lot of time
uh for that to come together. And I
think people have kind of hit a wall
with what I think has been a very
frenzyfilled, anxious sprint on getting
like genius around this stuff overnight.
&gt;&gt; So, so last data point and style, I want
your take on this. You know, I just
talked about this on the 10X podcast
this past week. MIT came out with this
study. 95% of Gen AI pilots are failing
inside of enterprises. Um, and then in
addition to that, there's this usage
problem. So, people have their workflows
and they like doing their current
workflow and every time they change
their workflow, right, it takes more
time for them at especially initially to
get running back again um with with like
something that's more productive or even
as productive as before. So sle, you
have to sell one of these products all
day long. It's one of the products I do
use every day. Like I'm sure you're
starting to feel this or hear this in
your buyer set. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I know. I I was a uh maybe naive of me
and maybe I'm in a bubble, which I
definitely am, but um I try and get
outside that bubble obviously a bunch.
Uh but I was a little bit surprised. I'm
surprised by you saying here obviously,
you know, when we sort of said, "Hey,
we're going to talk about this topic." I
was like, "Hey, I'm I'm not coming to
that like discussion super well armed
because I haven't been in a bunch of
those discussions before." I think now
hearing you folks talk about it. Um
there's like two two approaches I have
to it is like what are these people that
you're having dinner with doing because
they're doing it wrong if they haven't
felt any impact? Because when I
literally think about how we build our
business and the support tooling we use
and how we generate leads via outbound
and how we optimize our market like
there is AI infused in all of that and
like it's in some cases it's under the
hood and it's just the tool has just
upleveled since we started using it but
in some cases it's like a very you know
deliberate like a different way of
solving that problem that now is now
like how we how we operate. Um, and then
the other part of me was when I was
thinking about some of our customers,
maybe our larger customers, I think is
an important thing is yeah, maybe I can
sort of understand what people are
talking about because I think what I
think there I do think there's a little
bit of a sugar rush with some AI
products where you're like, "Oh my god,
how did it do that thing?" And like
there's like you're just sort of really
happy about the the idea that it sort of
it did something really cool. Um, and
then you sort of realize, okay, but to
rely on this in my actual work, I need
it to be reliable like 99.99% of the
time. And so, okay, someone's come along
and said, I can't use that in this
situation. Instead, I have to use this
other tool, which is a bolt onto our
existing system, and that's actually
really terrible, and uh I'm therefore
I'm not realizing any benefits. Um, so I
think that's one thing that I'm seeing a
lot of where there's a you've moved from
this world of very um, you know, high
agency, initiative taking types who
adopt individual tools and like love it
and use it. And then but now it's like
the t the the the almost more mature
decisions are being made where central
procurement decisions of what software
to buy are being made and sometimes
those decisions you know no one gets
fired for no one gets fired for buying
IBM type situation right and maybe it's
not actually the best AI tool it's just
the one that sits nicely within your
existing um stack so there could be some
of that at play and I say the second
element is um
I think people are realizing I would say
almost what from the outside I would say
your journey has been Nolan which is you
have to put work into it to actually get
like enterprisegrade
resolution solutions generations however
you want to think about it and if you if
you
that's work it's like an actual skill to
learn to build the intuition around how
to get real value where to apply this
technology and also how to get value out
of it that I think most people still
don't have
&gt;&gt; I think that's so true I was at a a
meetup a couple weeks ago at playground
over there in Palo Alto and we were just
literally having some real talk about
this and we were like it's kind of the
human curse of instant gratification
like oh I want all this to it's like no
this is going to take a lot of work a
lot of time a lot of failure I think we
saw some of you know remember that
correction in the market when like oh
all the AI shares dropped and everyone
AI it's like no I I think it was a
healthy correction and it's still going
to be huge it's just we're going through
this early flow and I think you're
seeing some of the human traits of like
it has to be done tomorrow it has to be
all solved and you're completely right I
think that it's going to take a lot of
time a lot of reps and just like any
huge wave this is probably what one of
the hugest waves in 30 years plus like
&gt;&gt; I think in humanity like literally in
the in the history of human beings like
this is the biggest wave we've had
outside of fire it's like AI
&gt;&gt; so profound humanity it's it's poetry
Yes, it's huge. And there's early
adopters, right? And then there's people
that are like anti and then there's
everyone in the middle. And I think you
have also stratifications of those
people in the middle. And some of them
are more on the side of early adopters
and experimenting and others are not.
And I think what I've seen as a ripple
of some of this stuff is a lot of people
are like, I'm not anti-AII. I get it.
It's going to be a way of life,
&gt;&gt; but I'm going to let you know the these
people like run on the trail. And so
when the trail like goes from brush to
like a nice groomed walking trail, I'm
in like now I'm going to make it a part
of my life but not struggle through it
all. That's kind of my simple view of
it.
&gt;&gt; But but but are these people not that
you spoke to at this dinner, are they
not using chat GPT at least? Like that's
what I don't get. Like chat GPT is so
useful. or whatever your your sort of
your your your LLM of choice that's so
useful I don't that's the bit where I
&gt;&gt; they are yeah I'm sorry they're using
that but like I'm talking about you know
more in depth workflows and
&gt;&gt; I I so one other theory I'd throw out
there and like unfortunately you've
probably got me in like u where I can
talk the longest and also probably lose
a bunch of people on this like it could
be this it could be that but one other
thing I would throw out there is I
wonder if there's like an innovator's
dilemma type thing going on here where
okay if I let's let's imagine I'm like a
data I'm I'm a data scientist I'm a data
analyst and yeah okay I can ask chat to
run that analysis for me but it's like
not as accurate as if I had done it and
my job is data science and therefore
this is not as good and like I don't
want to use it and so in that world
you're in this situation where this is
not actually at par with these expert
humans who are doing this task and you
don't want to give the AI your data
anyway because it might not understand
it fully and we don't yet maybe trust it
fully to to ingest that data. So there's
a bunch of reasons that won't work. But
if you if you play it through in an
innovator's dilemma sort of scenario
where there'll be some companies coming
up now and thinking should we hire a
data scientist and they'll be they'll be
exposing themselves to using chat GBT
essentially or some other tool as their
data analyst. Um and they're just going
to delay that decision because it's it's
it their sort of alternative is to have
no one doing this at all. Like no one's
going to do this analysis or I'm just
going to ask chat if you need to do it.
And you need like years for that to
flush through and then see that actually
companies have much smaller data
analysis teams now because they actually
tend to rely on AI for like 80% of their
their analysis or something like that.
And that that's like that I wouldn't say
it's a generational thing but it takes
years to flush through. It takes like
companies to that are startups now to
become larger companies and almost have
almost a different ontology as a as an
organization at that point. Yeah, Kelly,
I like your your term correction because
I actually think we're in an
expectations correction right now. And
sle, like I you know, you and I talk all
the time about this stuff because we're
like one of the theories sil and I have
is if you just show people how it works
and you give them real life examples,
they are much more likely to try it. And
that's been very effective in
conversations that I've been having. And
it turns out there just actually aren't
that many useful examples. Obviously,
chatbt, everyone's using that every day.
Uh, you know, you kind of sound like a
mid if you're like, "Oh, yeah, I use
chatbt every day at a dinner." Like, no
one's saying that anymore because it's
so coded into the way that we already
operate. But
&gt;&gt; also, no one knows what mid is. So,
&gt;&gt; it's fine. They'll figure it out.
&gt;&gt; Some of some of us are over 40.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, some of us are close and
it's scarier by the day. But my my point
here is like so I'll use this data point
which is really interesting is I talked
to a uh head of recruiting operations at
a very large public tech company that
everyone who's listening to this knows
what this company is and that person
said to me the craziest thing which was
we have the chat GBT enterprise edition
and only 60% of our employees are using
it every day and I was like What the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What? That's it? Like, I'm in this
thing all day long. And so, um, then she
said that the second thing is is that we
get so many requests from our recruiting
team on new tools to test that my
verbatim she says that my word of the
quarter is no. Like, we are not doing
anything else until you just do the
basics.

So, Kelly, to kind of go back to the
discussion on workflows, the thing I've
been learning here is that it's actually
not the most profound
things. Like, I because I went in with
the same expectation, right? I went in
with this expectation like, "Oh my god,
A is going to change my life and it's
going to happen by the end of the week.
Like, by Friday, like I'm going to tell
everybody like how sick my workflow is."
That's not what's happening.
It's every week I'm tinkering with
things to basically get like 30 minutes
back.
And that actually is happening, right?
That is that is happening for me on a on
a week in weekout basis specifically
because I'm doing executive search now
using Metavuse tool. It's happening for
me and I'm just dialing it in as I go.
It's not this big like excavation thing.
It's like an hour or two at the front
end and then 10 to 15 minutes of
tinkering per week to get essentially 30
minutes week over week back in my day.
That's what's happening for me.
&gt;&gt; I just want to jump on that because I'm
going to go on a little bit of a soap
box here. I think we've made this thing
so unnecessarily
complex in the way we talk about this.
It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scaring people. Like look
at the title of this. Like what was it
called? Trough of disillusionment.
What What is that even? What are you t
hallucinations that like you're
completely right I think that if we just
get it down to something very simple
pick something go to metav view and
experiment with 10% of one workflow if
you don't like it or it's break breaking
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or freaking people out you can pull
back you can go slow today I uploaded
three executive compensation
benchmark reports that are like 30 pages
each terrible I mean who wants to re it
spit me out eight slides on some data
and I checked it but again Nolan to your
point that saved me what 2 three hours.
So these simple things that I think um
we have done everyone a disservice or at
least that's my opinion of talking like
it's some huge magic show that you have
to be a like it's not it's very simple
and I've just personally tried even for
myself just think about it and write it
down in very simple terms and it's much
more like it's much more palatable.
&gt;&gt; Yep. S are you seeing this with larger
enterprise customers like
&gt;&gt; what do you like you know you have you
have tons of users in this thing every
day like yeah what's the feedback in the
buying cycle?
No, no, definitely don't have this like
uh customers that we speak to, I'm not
going to say they're all in on AI, but
I'd say that's like the overall um
momentum is listen, we're we're pretty
pill here. AI is going to be part of how
we do work and you know, whatever. We've
heard good things about Meta View. Let's
explore it, whatever. So, no, I don't
definitely don't hear this. What I do
see is uh um heightened expectations for
sure which I think maybe is also part of
what's that could also be part of this
disillusionment actually is this maybe
this like insanely high expectations set
which then brought up the expectations
and now you realize actually to get that
level of result which this you know mini
influencer is talking about they're
doing you know I need to sort of do all
these things which I'm not prepared to
do or don't understand or whatever it
might be but no we don't see the um
listen we're like pretty bearish we're
not seeing any bearishness on AI to be
honest with with you at all. I think
that there's like a Kelly your point of
just choose one thing. If we want to be
really really basic about the most
common and clearly valuable use case
that everyone has experienced and
frankly is a big part of our product as
well. It is summarization.
Don't make me go through all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
Can you go through it for me in two
seconds and tell me the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I need to
know? And I'll tell you if that's not
the right stuff, bring something else
back instead. That is like basically
what chat GB is in a nutshell. It's
ingested all of the world's knowledge
and you're going to query it for the
things that you think are interesting.
And there's a lot of other tools out
there that obviously the use cases you
just described there's summarization. So
I do think there's like I probably think
that two years or two three years ago
versus today if we're going to choose
one thing that's like solved, it's like
summarization. Surely, I hope there are
not any humans out there now who are
spending hours and hours and hours
summarizing large amounts of data
because that is clearly something that
this form of intelligence is much better
at doing. And if you're not, I would say
that's like a clear place where you can
to your like you know you can get I
would say hours back per week um for in
most any any job that requires that. So
often when I talk to we have like a few
ways that we few different types of
customers that we speak to. Sometimes we
end up we want to go and speak to
leaders of the organization not really
specifically about any one product just
about how to think about AI and
recruiting. And there are really four
buckets that we explain to people. This
is where you should be looking and this
is not this is not this is not a sales
thing. This is just like my legitimate
advice. One is unlocking the value of
unstructured data which is essentially
maybe a fancy way of saying
summarization. get the information you
want out of this like mass of
unstructured information. The second is
scaling access to expertise. So Nolan
and I have done a bunch of work where
we've looked at people building custom
GPTs which I would say is an example of
this. Someone that's an expert has given
a bunch of knowledge to a GPT and said
you can go and now you rest of team can
use this as well and now you're all
experts as well because you have access
to this GPT which is an expert. like
scaling access to expertise is really
good. Right now to get access preI to
get access to expertise I'd have to like
book some time with you Kelly and say I
need to get some time with you to learn
from you and you don't need to do that
so much anymore. There's a third which
we talk about which is basically abil
the ability to it's somewhat connected
to summarization really but synthesizing
multiple different modalities and
sources at the same time like if you
wanted to go and do some research on any
given topic sounds like for this
compensation thing it was just some
documents but what if you also had to
watch a YouTube video and you also had
to go and speak to some expert network
to get the full picture again you can
just ask an AI to go and like seek these
different sources now with a genic
workflow so synthesizing different
modalities which you as a human inherent
ently have to do in sequence. You no
longer like an AI doesn't have to do it
in sequence. It does it all at once. And
then the last step is or the other
bucket is just automating very frequent
tasks. And I would actually say that's
probably the one that's least in a way
been least impacted because actually if
you're talking about very frequent
mundane tasks, you don't need
intelligence on tap to do that. You can
run write a bunch of if statements and
do that. So I think it's probably the
automation piece where people aren't
&gt;&gt; they thought it was going to be the we
were going to get this panacea by the
end of the week of automation and
actually know because we've realized
actually we've already automated all the
simple stuff. The stuff that hasn't been
automated so far is the things that
requires quite a lot of judgment and to
have to make judgment you need a lot of
context to sort of put that we probably
haven't documented. It's like tribal
knowledge for us and that's what the AI
is lacking.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to switch topics really
fast to talk about what that what Kelly
brought up and now I've heard three
times in a week which is compensation.
So, uh, two conversations in the last 5
days have essentially been along this
line with current talent leaders. One
person today said, "If you're ahead of
Total Rewards and you're like focused on
comp, I think like you're probably like
the most at risk right now of anybody in
the field." And I said, "That's
interesting. Like why?" He goes, "It's
literally just inputs and outputs,
right? Like there, this is just
numbers." And so your point around
summary style, I think, is such a valid
one here. The other one which was last
week, this person said, "Yeah, actually
one of the first use cases we had was
comp because the recruiting team was
pinging the comp team and asking for the
band." And instead of just like asking
for the band every time, right? Like
instead what we did is we built this
thing which has the all the comp bands
in the company. It has the levels. FYI
data and then they're taking the the
this is where like the end state is the
next version of this is they're taking
all of the inputs that they're getting
from the recruiter screen in metav view
and also putting that in to now
everybody has a holistic understanding
of like what is the comp when a
recruiter asks for it and the comp team
now is just serving as a backs stop as
opposed to a front of the house person.
if you want to go get an offer, you have
to go talk to Comp God and Comp God will
give you like, you know, whatever the
ruling is on the thing. Now, it's like,
let's actually use AI to figure this out
and then more AI data from Metaview if
we want to go back to the comp team and
say, this actually is not what we're
hearing from the market. Kelly, have you
seen any of this stuff yet?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have. I mean, basically, the
data is now kind of open sourced
everywhere.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know what I mean? There's no more.
Like remember I was at Yahoo back in
 
&gt;&gt; I wasn't even born yet.
&gt;&gt; See,
so mid. So mid.
And we literally would have one to two
day turnarounds, right? Like emailing
the comp person from building A to
building D on what that comp range is.
And this is a big thing we talked about
with like platforms like Metaview or
other or even you know LinkedIn assist.
We had that you know had that dude on
Nolan.
&gt;&gt; The self-service nature of all this
stuff is it's like now entrepreneurs
right you can start companies in one day
in your garage and have a you know
billion dollar revenue per employee.
Like it's just so easy now to get access
to this. Um so I I agree with you.
&gt;&gt; This one's real. K, what are you seeing
&gt;&gt; on on that though? No, obviously the
comp strategy, I'm not saying a I can
come up with one and it'll be in the
same boat of well, I can take it or
leave it, but the comp strategy is
different, right? Deciding, hey, we've
decided our comp strategy is we're going
to pay this centile and this in this
location blah blah blah. Yeah, spit out
the number. AI can do that and like it
can be very dynamic, which is a good use
case, but the comp strategy is still
something that right now I'd say is like
completely human judgment. The final
decision on what is our actual strategy
is human judgment. The other thing I'd
say the the sort of obviously the AI
shops are not
deciding what to pay people based on any
of this sort of like public data. They
are doing it based on like true business
strategy of how much am I business am I
willing to give up to hire this talent.
So maybe there'll also just be a change
in almost like we I guess comp is a good
example of is it the end state for comp
that we bucket every human in our
company into like seven different levels
and end different job probably not
probably we're going to end up knowing
humans on a far deeper level because of
AI and maybe we choose compens we set
compensation based on like in a much
more micro sort of micro way and so that
that maybe is more like a change of what
a comp person's role will become is Hey,
listen. We don't need this super fuzzy
like just seven levels per thing and
this job families or whatever. Actually,
at this time for the business, this
function is really important. So, this
is going to be actually a tier three
role or whatever. And this person is so
special that even though they're a nice,
you know, that's the way it should get.
And sometimes I think like sports teams
are a really good analogy for that
because you have like the thing sports
team have obviously is very like lots of
data about the people and how they
perform. There's very few slots on a
team. So, you can end up putting a ton
of focus into like what decision do we
make about this one human? Maybe AI is
going to get us to the point where we
can actually be that granular about
every height and that's going to be
about that's going to affect comp as
well. So I think that's a really good
example actually of like hey think about
what might change because we have AI as
opposed to thinking AI means that this
is not no longer needed.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've talked about that a lot. I
like that angle. I think it's I think
it's true. You know, I kind of think
about it like if AI is the hands right
now at least, right? They're the hands
that are lifting lifting the bricks to
build the house. But you still have to
have a brain that's architecting the
house. And like as AI gets better and
better with the bricks, your brain has
to heighten, right? As long as as long
as our brains are staying ahead of what
AI is doing and there's added value,
there's more value in that then I think
you know that that's in the right
direction. It's kind of like what we say
with right with equity and venture
valuation. Like the 409A is going up,
but it's fine as long as the value of
the company is going up. It's just if
those become inverted then people get in
trouble.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. To look to tie it all the way back
to what I started with though, right?
This is like the disillusionment is
coming because we're we keep projecting
into the future versus talking about
like real use cases today and that. So,
Sy, I'm with you. Like I actually like I
hadn't thought about it that way. That's
like pretty that's pretty interesting
and I'm going to spend a few cycles on
that. But today, right, you can use AI
to completely accelerate how like how
you get an offer out the door if you're
at a big company. Like at Google, I
literally had to go sit with the comp
team on Tuesday and Thursday between 3
and 5. Like that's how that worked. Like
I had to go sit with Gerald for two and
I had to like get in there and then be
like, "Come on Gerald, like give a
better offer." Sort of a thing. That's
crazy in today's era. And I actually
what what took me most by surprise was
hearing it two or three times in the
last week and real use cases of how it's
just speeding up everyone's workflow.
And so again, I just want to keep
underscoring this point. And probably if
you're a frequent listener on the
podcast, you're going to say like,
Nolan, please shut up. I've heard you
say this a million times, but no longer
think about taking down the whole
elephant, right? Like just take it one
bite at a time. See if you can shave off
five to 10 minutes here and there. And
what you tend to find is that like that
momentum begins to accelerate because if
you show that internally to your people
ops team, all of a sudden someone else
is going to be inspired to do something
in their world. And that's how you
actually get the sort of innovation
inside of the org. Because I'm tell I'm
just like so scared of seeing my friends
like our friend at dinner Kelly who will
remain unnamed who was like I'm not
doing anything and I'm going to wait for
other people to do it. The only thought
I had when that person said that was
like dude you are in trouble.
&gt;&gt; I don't know I don't know about that. I
I don't know if I agree with that.
&gt;&gt; You think you think wait and see you
think wait and see is a is a successful
strategy here with your leadership team.
I don't think wait and see is a
successful STR. I think it depends on
the organization. I think it depends on
that leadership team. I think there I
think there is a continuum of cultures
around this and just like there is a
continuum of users around this and I do
think that there are some companies that
are not pushing it and you wouldn't be
in trouble if you're and the second
thing I'd say on that doesn't mean wait
and see like forever. This could be like
two months and there could be like let's
take sle in front of me. So there could
be like a metav view use case that like
is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clear and like clean. I
would argue that sle also probably has a
lot of early adopters that are really
comfortable with this and yeah are
leaning in or else their company is tops
down being like do this or you're
behind. Right. To your to your point
Nolan I don't think all companies are
like that yet but I think they will get
there. I just think there is probably a
place in the world for people that are
like, I'm going to wait three to six
months and I'm gonna again wait for this
trail to be a little bit more worn so I
can run down it faster and not get lost
in the jungle.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me just
&gt;&gt; I surprisingly I actually agree with
Kelly. I think that
&gt;&gt; surprising
&gt;&gt; not because I don't agree with you,
Kelly, but just because I think that's
the slightly that's the slightly less I
guess the obvious thing for me to say
maybe would be like everyone should be
aggressively like adopting AI in every
way they can. I just think the reality
of like like society is you have some
people who are trailblazers and
sometimes they do things that don't work
and then people don't copy that thing
and then they do something that does
work and they get like some fame out of
it like maybe within the company or
maybe within the world and then
everyone's like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going
to do that too." Um, and I think that is
just how ideas spread. And it's on
companies like ours, I guess, to make
people heroes and trailblazers within
their company and then tell the rest of
everyone about it. I think it's quite I
I just think that's like human nature.
There was no point in like fighting
against it. That is that is that is
human nature.
&gt;&gt; I think there is a lot more human nature
in all of this than we're even talking
about. And I don't just mean early
adopter of this. I mean also the frenzy
and the fanfare and the propaganda
making everyone feel like it needs to be
done. I think there's a lot of human
nature in this and I think you're
completely right sle that it's almost
like a go slow to go fast. Like you're
going to take your customer base and
you're all going to prove something and
then it's going to be how the how the
world works. I would argue like what if
you had
 
probably wouldn't be able to go as fast
as you're going or you'd be like stop
let me let me work with a subset and
then scale it out essentially. He's
like, "Well, I think I think it
 
just just to obviously just to clear
clarify like what's the downside is like
that what you don't want to be is
someone who is against the technology in
my opinion." That's what that's the
really losing position is like I don't
care what evidence I see and I'm going
to throw up every objection I can to why
that's not going to work and that's
doesn't you know work in this situation
therefore I can't do it. That's the
losing position. They're like
purposefully object like throwing up
every objection you can. That's the in
my opinion dumb move. I think they're
like observing the market and thinking
listen Nolan's really good at
experimenting stuff. I'm just gonna
watch what he does and then you know
take my pick. I just think I think
that's fine. You can do that. It's uh
you know a healthy portion of the
population will do that and still be
okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I think that that subset is very
small like the the fullon they they
wouldn't have be they wouldn't have at
the dinner if they were full on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You guys don't effectively
convince me though. Like I I think that
that's right. I think it's uh you know I
think that this needs to be true then
like if you are an AI tech company
selling into recruiters or people
operations the foundational level
requirement now is that you are the ones
showing how this is being used in other
companies and where like where you are
missing leverage right it no longer as a
buyer is acceptable for you to sell the
future anymore and just the future.
Have have you you guys have talked about
like this whole like Ford deployed
engineer or like Ford deployed as like
the new sort of like job to jour that
that is exa that is basically connected
to this problem. It's like
&gt;&gt; exactly
&gt;&gt; we need our people to go into these
companies and show them how to dig for
this gold because it's not actually like
a natural it's not like a natural
intuition people have. So yeah, it's
almost clear in how frankly AI companies
like us are operating. The fact that
we're so hands-on with customers to help
them get the most out of it is almost
proof in itself that this is work and
it's a skill. Otherwise, you know,
otherwise we wouldn't bother basically.
&gt;&gt; Yep. 100%. Cool. Thank you guys for this
conversation. Continue to hit us up with
like what you guys want to see on our AI
corner with Sil. I think the comp thing
was something that was brought up in
passing over the course of the last 5 to
 
the comments. Let us know what you guys
want to see. We'll see you soon. Peace.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is great.
