fifth you're always kind of in in second
 
fifth you're always kind of in in second
to fourth gear on this stuff and I think
 
to fourth gear on this stuff and I think
that's number one dude when you're like
 
that's number one dude when you're like
oh my God I'm starting from Scrat so
 
oh my God I'm starting from Scrat so
that's kind of my initial reaction Nolan
 
that's kind of my initial reaction Nolan
is how do we avoid you having to be in
 
is how do we avoid you having to be in
this situation yeah so let me get into
 
this situation yeah so let me get into
this with the specifically I've been
 
this with the specifically I've been
thinking about this problem because I
 
thinking about this problem because I
think you and I are actually hearing
 
think you and I are actually hearing
from a lot of folks in our nwor who had
 
from a lot of folks in our nwor who had
been working at these Fang companies for
 
been working at these Fang companies for
a long time these Fang companies are now
 
a long time these Fang companies are now
going through layoffs they're getting a
 
going through layoffs they're getting a
lot leaner than they were in the past
 
lot leaner than they were in the past
and I think candidly what's really
 
and I think candidly what's really
happening right now is as these people
 
happening right now is as these people
enter the job market they haven't been
 
enter the job market they haven't been
in the jar market and so they're not
 
in the jar market and so they're not
used to it number one and then number
 
used to it number one and then number
two sadly I think there's a little bit
 
two sadly I think there's a little bit
of a you know if you worked at a Fan
 
of a you know if you worked at a Fan
Company bias working against you because
 
Company bias working against you because
there's this narrative right now that if
 
there's this narrative right now that if
you work in Fang you know you're just
 
you work in Fang you know you're just
like making the button blue or something
 
like making the button blue or something
like that so let me start with like
 
like that so let me start with like
thing one which is I think you have to
 
thing one which is I think you have to
recalibrate
 
recalibrate
expectations and understand what has
 
expectations and understand what has
worked in the past no longer applies
 
worked in the past no longer applies
today and so that's thing one thing two
 
today and so that's thing one thing two
is then you need to design your value
 
is then you need to design your value
proposition for today's market so like
 
proposition for today's market so like
what did you do in the past that can now
 
what did you do in the past that can now
be applied moving forward for the types
 
be applied moving forward for the types
of companies that you are applying at
 
of companies that you are applying at
and this is like a one to two sentence
 
and this is like a one to two sentence
thing this isn't like three pages of in
 
thing this isn't like three pages of in
it's like get super clear and concise on
 
it's like get super clear and concise on
the value that you can deliver to help
 
the value that you can deliver to help
these companies solve problems the next
 
these companies solve problems the next
thing is you need to get very targeted
 
thing is you need to get very targeted
with the types of companies and roles
 
with the types of companies and roles
you are interested in and can add value
 
you are interested in and can add value
to so and that should be very much
 
to so and that should be very much
aligned to that value proposition that I
 
aligned to that value proposition that I
talked about so I'm actually still okay
 
talked about so I'm actually still okay
with you applying like that's fine but
 
with you applying like that's fine but
then everybody needs to take the next
 
then everybody needs to take the next

the math equation for them like oh like
 
the math equation for them like oh like
this person's experience plus the
 
this person's experience plus the
problem we're solving equals maybe a
 
problem we're solving equals maybe a
higher here and so they're just more
 
higher here and so they're just more
