what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics Kelly
we're coming back with dear
Heretics I've been working in tech for
 
performer I'm now looking for my next
role and submitting 100 plus resume is a
week but I'm hearing crickets how should
I
 
navigate oh there's so much underneath
this right first of all thank you for
the dear Heretics I think we have seven
in the queue so please keep those
coming
um yeah so let's let's unpack it so I
have 15 years of experience at reputable
companies so let's scenario plan this
Nolan like what might that look like
maybe eight years is at a Google kind of
thing is that what we're talking about
exactly big Tech yeah okay big Tech Fang
type companies again I will jump to the
chase if you're looking for a job first
of all if you can avoid it at all costs
you never want to be in the position
where you're applying to jobs all day
ever right the the ideal is you're never
looking for a job you're always kind of
on a rolling basis curating opport
unities talking to people informally
maybe
informally entertaining conversations
maybe going on site to companies so it's
kind of like you know a rolling calendar
it's a rolling interview process and so
it's not it's never been a starter stop
for me does that make sense like even if
I love what I'm doing I love the company
I I don't want to leave for years and
years you're still interviewing yeah so
it it's like a car it should never be in
neutral and it should never always be in
fifth you're always kind of in in second
to fourth gear on this stuff and I think
that's number one dude when you're like
oh my God I'm starting from Scrat so
that's kind of my initial reaction Nolan
is how do we avoid you having to be in
this situation yeah so let me get into
this with the specifically I've been
thinking about this problem because I
think you and I are actually hearing
from a lot of folks in our nwor who had
been working at these Fang companies for
a long time these Fang companies are now
going through layoffs they're getting a
lot leaner than they were in the past
and I think candidly what's really
happening right now is as these people
enter the job market they haven't been
in the jar market and so they're not
used to it number one and then number
two sadly I think there's a little bit
of a you know if you worked at a Fan
Company bias working against you because
there's this narrative right now that if
you work in Fang you know you're just
like making the button blue or something
like that so let me start with like
thing one which is I think you have to
recalibrate
expectations and understand what has
worked in the past no longer applies
today and so that's thing one thing two
is then you need to design your value
proposition for today's market so like
what did you do in the past that can now
be applied moving forward for the types
of companies that you are applying at
and this is like a one to two sentence
thing this isn't like three pages of in
it's like get super clear and concise on
the value that you can deliver to help
these companies solve problems the next
thing is you need to get very targeted
with the types of companies and roles
you are interested in and can add value
to so and that should be very much
aligned to that value proposition that I
talked about so I'm actually still okay
with you applying like that's fine but
then everybody needs to take the next
step which is cold outreaching to either
the CEO the hiring manager or somebody
on the recruiting team and this email
should look like five to seven sentences
Max and this is like the framework for
the email quick intro on you why you
love the company why why you're a great
fit for the role and then ask to jump on
a call to discuss further with the
hiring manager CEO or whoever is most
relevant to have the conversation the
reason this works is because inbound
buckets so like right when you apply to
a a company's website you get we used to
call it the bucket you get dropped into
this bucket and recruiters as we've been
talking about Kelly are completely
overwhelmed they're not looking at the
buckets because it's typically low
quality
and the buckets are not everyone thinks
like the bucket has like Ai and it's
like oh like here's the best candidates
like talk to these people that's not how
it works it's
chronological and so you know if you
jump in there right after a job opens
there could be 1,500 people who jump in
in the you know 24 to 36 hours after you
and no one's ever going to see your
resume the second thing is is like
people love their ego stroked and this
is true in all aspects of life and it is
especially is true for CEOs and hiring
managers and so telling them how great
their company is makes them feel good it
also makes them feel like you have
already done some homework you know
you've kind of like you know started the
the math equation for them like oh like
this person's experience plus the
problem we're solving equals maybe a
higher here and so they're just more
likely to get in touch with you it does
not guarantee they will get in touch
with you but I think it does it does
significantly more for you than just
like lobbing a resume over the fence and
hoping somebody sees
it yeah um if helpful I think about this
kind of uh in two categories category
one is in my opinion everything we need
to be doing before we have to find or we
want to find another job yeah okay so
let's talk about that
first even if you don't need a job or
don't want a new one you have to make
sure that you're maximizing yourself in
your role and what that does not look
like is what I've seen at a lot of
specifically larger companies Nolan
which is I'm comfortable I'm at a
 
like molasses and I can chill out rest
invest my head's kind of in the sand and
I don't care because I'm really
comfortable I don't know what's going on
around me I'm just kind of doing stuff I
think that's starting to backfire when
this stuff happens what it looks like
when you are maximizing Your Role you're
not being lazy you're making sure that
you're learning and achieving new things
you're putting yourself into stretch
goal situations and pushing yourself not
just accepting like you're doing great
keep going you're making a ton of
friends and connections and networks
inside your company and like are a node
of influence right those social nodes I
don't mean it to be an extrovert but
you're not just hanging out with two
people in your department like you're
maximizing the situation you're in
you're not just kind of hanging
out hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently high quality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview and
I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards metav view changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and it can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a Time saver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out medavie head over to metav
view. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
medavie product experts tell them that
me and Kelly sent you or you could just
go to their website and get started for
free you'll be up running an AI enabled
in minutes the other thing that looks
like is outside of your company I like
to call it you always keep the cement
truck turning like the cement truck is
always mixing you're going to events at
least once every two or three months
you're having coffee breakfast dinner
whatever you want to do work out dates
yoga dates knitting dates with people
you've worked with in the past you're
keeping up connections and you're
helping them and they're helping you and
you're staying smart you're making new
friends at thought leadership events at
dinners right we all get those dinners
dude go to one once in a while and I'm
telling you that the cement truck needs
to always be turning inside your company
and outside and I swear if you do that
right and consistently over a period of
years you really won't have to be in a
position this person's
describing yeah I really believe that
okay part two is when you boom you need
a job right we've all I guess been there
we've all like I you know I was banging
my head against the wall in 2002 trying
to like how do you do that I'm gonna be
really honest I can take a lot of flak
don't apply for jobs do not spend 10
hours a
day doing forms and pressing enter into
the black box or whatever you called it
Nolan I tell people all the time people
I coach I said stop doing that spend 10
hours a day making a list of people
Andor companies that you find
interesting or you like by the time you
apply for the job Hell by the time a job
is posted we know it's like gone it's I
believe it's mostly a waste of your time
to sit there and apply for jobs over and
over and over and and get nothing so I
tell people listen you go out and I
don't care where you spend time chat GPT
it spend time on Google top 100 Venture
back companies you know top companies to
go public this year I there's a million
different searches you can do that will
elicit you a lot of information it'll
give you two companies go spend time on
LinkedIn looking at great people who
work in those companies it could be a
business leader in your function it
could be a recruiter to your point Nolan
it could be a Founder CEO or coo and you
send LinkedIn notes to them right so I'd
rather you send a 100 LinkedIn notes to
those targeted people than a 100
applications because you will get at
least five back and those people will
have coffee with you or they'll have a
video chat I'm one of them they'll be
like sure now you just made a new friend
and when you talk to them you say can
you introduce me to two to three people
in the company because I'm really
interested in the company I want to grow
my network there's probably a job open
but there will be and you curate those
things I I swear that is a much more
potent use of your time than blindly
applying to things that are probably
already closed yeah I you there's a lot
of gold in like what you just said I
think like a couple
things what you're really saying is like
the the First on on the first piece is
the best time to look for a job is when
you have one and like the click- in
there though is like it's not even that
you you know maybe you're happy in your
job but you're just open to exploring
you're open to having conversations
you're open open to seeing like where
the world is going to pull you right
like you just never know um and I always
tell people like always take the
recruiter call like always like or if
you know a recruiter who's like looking
for like try and help them out right
like you're just I think you just put
Goodwill into the world and then it
comes back to you um the other thing on
on point one that you just made there is
like I think people who have have come
out of this last era are having a very
hard time quantifying their business
value and that is now table Stakes
that's a table Stakes expectation for
every employer they're going to ask you
well what' you do in your last job you
know e Elon sent this email to the
government last week he did it you know
to Twitter two years ago it's like well
what five things did you do last week
and people are in an uproar
about this thing and it turns out that
like it's a pretty good way to figure
out like what did you actually do and
did it contribute to the value of the
company and so instead of like you know
kind of like getting all worked up over
those things like actually take a step
back and say like oh my God things are
changing I need to get like way more
specific and I need to be codifying the
things that I'm doing that are driving
business value um now moving into like
the second piece which is like now
you're in the situation what do you do I
love your feedback on on cold outbounds
um you need to get really good at that
uh we'll drop in a couple of of links
into the show notes so you can know what
like what these are there's very good
resources available online but I'll just
give you like one of my f my favorite
Frameworks and I think it applies to
almost every area of life when you're
introducing yourself to a stranger I
call it compliment and introduce like
this is how I make friends at the gym
like I see somebody who's like you know
looking jacked or like lifting a ton of
Weights never talked to this dude before
in my life and I go up I'm like dude I
see you here every day like my name is
Nolan it's nice to meet you and people
just like love that stuff right like
they love to be compliment and they're
way more likely to engage with you I
think you got to be a little careful on
how you ask for something especially if
you don't know the person so like it's
amazing that you're open to like all
this on LinkedIn like candidly like
I struggle with it um if I don't know
you and the first first time you ping me
you're asking for something and it's
going to take up a significant portion
of my time and potentially like have to
put my neck on the line for you like I I
don't think I'm going to do that but if
you do the compliment int introduced
framework and just say like hey I'm
looking around for these types of roles
if you hear anything like please let me
know that's easy for me right you've
made it so much easier for me than like
this big Next Step that I have to take
yeah um uh two other things that you
mentioned as part of that so like I
forgot this in in the the first I said
but like you're 100% right that
referrals so like if you're interested
in a company and you know someone inside
that company that is the best possible
way for you to get in as like one of the
top candidates to at least get on a
phone call with somebody inside that
company that's a great great feedback
from you and then on the list uh my
buddy Tyler Hogue just put out for the
second year in a row he calls it the
exceptional startup list all of these
companies are hiring every single one of
them are hiring right now and that is
the perfect place start it's really good
feedback I would literally Google all
those lists your to yes exactly said and
just start getting to know people at
those companies I will say just to just
to underline the point no one wants to
help someone who's lazy no one
especially people that have killed
themselves to like work really hard
their whole careers no one's going to
just give something to someone who
hasn't put in any leg work
so again to to your Point Nolan if
you're asking for something without
having a a point of view or doing some
leg work before or having like a
tailored ask with a help like just don't
make it hard for people to help you
because they're not going to yeah yep
and so look guys it's a it is a very
tough job market it is I think it's the
most unique job market I've experienced
in my career right we mentioned
companies are getting leaner AI is a
thing one of the things and I talked
about last week is like how can you
teach a company how to use AI because
none of these companies actually are
using it that well it turns out and so
can you start to become more native in
in like this future technology and then
figure out a way uh to express that and
to show that you've been doing the work
that you've been growing and that you
can add this value to a company uh so
please keep these questions come coming
with us uh we know this is actually like
one of the the hottest topics and to
Kelly's point you know this is like kind
of like scratching the surface at the
very top layer like ask us more specific
questions like what's going on in your
interview process and we're happy to
give you feedback on that awesome thanks
