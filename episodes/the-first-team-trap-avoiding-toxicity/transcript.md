down and Trust breaks down I feel like
 
down and Trust breaks down I feel like
the more that those Executives see their
 
the more that those Executives see their

them type of thing which is where the
danger comes
 
danger comes
in yeah I think it's also the just the

natural inclination of the people that
 
natural inclination of the people that
you hire you spend a lot of time with

have qualms or concerns to give those
credence potenti even above like the
 
credence potenti even above like the
qualms or concerns of the issues of the
 
qualms or concerns of the issues of the
business and so you know I think there's
 
business and so you know I think there's
actually a couple of takeaways um that I
 
actually a couple of takeaways um that I
think about with first team I think the
 
think about with first team I think the
first thing is is like I think
 
first thing is is like I think
everybody's first team in the company
 
everybody's first team in the company
should be the exact team and that sounds
 
should be the exact team and that sounds
like kind of crazy so say you're like an
 
like kind of crazy so say you're like an
ic3
 
ic3
engineer and you know your CEO gives a
 
engineer and you know your CEO gives a
presentation on you know the direction
 
presentation on you know the direction
of the company and potentially you get
 
of the company and potentially you get
information from your manager to do
 
information from your manager to do
something differently than that I I
 
something differently than that I I
think you should be really thoughtful
 
think you should be really thoughtful
because given that like your CEO just
 
because given that like your CEO just
gave this presentation you should be
 
gave this presentation you should be
doing what the C team wants you to do
 
doing what the C team wants you to do
and you know there's a a really
 
and you know there's a a really
challenging word that I'm going to use
 
challenging word that I'm going to use
but it's
 
but it's
insubordination and I think there's
 
insubordination and I think there's
actually quite a bit of this inside of
 
actually quite a bit of this inside of
companies to where people go
 
companies to where people go
Rogue and it can be damaging to because
 
Rogue and it can be damaging to because

direction Kelly I think that's where
problems really pop up inside a
 
problems really pop up inside a
companies I'm I'm chuckling because you
 
companies I'm I'm chuckling because you
always accuse me of you know describing
 
always accuse me of you know describing
Utopias and I think what you just
 
Utopias and I think what you just
described is a Utopia right an ic3
 
described is a Utopia right an ic3
engineer who is you know just just
 
engineer who is you know just just
blindly like the executive team is my
 
blindly like the executive team is my
first team manager and I like that's
 
first team manager and I like that's
just not realistic in a lot of ways
 
just not realistic in a lot of ways

see the execs half a time they're so

direction or a decision that the exec
 
direction or a decision that the exec
team made yeah and how do you go about
 
team made yeah and how do you go about
getting your team on board when they're

it's that it's like threading a dam
 
it's that it's like threading a dam
needle it is a huge balance and I'll
 
needle it is a huge balance and I'll
start with what not to do maybe what
 
start with what not to do maybe what
I've seen in my time is kind of the
 
I've seen in my time is kind of the
barbell thing I've seen two vinant like
 
barbell thing I've seen two vinant like
opposing things that Executives have
 
opposing things that Executives have
done that are equally terrible in my
 
done that are equally terrible in my
opinion and then don't balance those
 
opinion and then don't balance those
things so one of those things is they
 
things so one of those things is they
will like vinant oppose the exec team
 
will like vinant oppose the exec team
and they will kind of commiserate with
 
and they will kind of commiserate with
their team so to speak right they they
 
their team so to speak right they they
become one of the natives they become
 
become one of the natives they become
peers of their own damn lieutenants and
 
peers of their own damn lieutenants and
they commiserate and they they say this
 
they commiserate and they they say this
sucks everyone they're doing this to us
 
sucks everyone they're doing this to us
like I I don't
 
like I I don't
agree that's not good you know what I
 
agree that's not good you know what I
mean that that's not good and then the
 
mean that that's not good and then the
opposite of that is not explaining how
 
opposite of that is not explaining how
it was hard and being a robot and saying
 
it was hard and being a robot and saying
all right everyone let's go we're doing
 
all right everyone let's go we're doing
this and everyone's like what the hell
 
this and everyone's like what the hell
so you have to like let some air out of
 
so you have to like let some air out of
the balloon without popping it it's okay
 
the balloon without popping it it's okay
to like I I love to to explain how the
 
to like I I love to to explain how the
sausage was made listen I know you all
 
sausage was made listen I know you all
don't like this this is transparency of
 
don't like this this is transparency of
process this is what went down you know
 
process this is what went down you know
and using judgment here was my role in
 
and using judgment here was my role in
that here's how I opposed it or here's
 
that here's how I opposed it or here's
how I represented this here was the
 
how I represented this here was the
response and usually the story is more
 
response and usually the story is more
balanced
 
balanced
than just the outcome statement do you
 
than just the outcome statement do you
know what I mean so you take them
 
know what I mean so you take them
through that process you empathize a
 
through that process you empathize a
little bit and then you say no listen
 
little bit and then you say no listen
saddle up you know but I I've seen
 
saddle up you know but I I've seen
people that are just they just pair the
 
people that are just they just pair the
decision with nothing that sucks and
 
decision with nothing that sucks and
they become a victim and they start to
 
they become a victim and they start to
like act like a toddler with their team
 
like act like a toddler with their team
which also sucks and when that happens I
 
which also sucks and when that happens I
I think that that entire team is a lost
 
I think that that entire team is a lost
cause and I've experienced it and you
 
cause and I've experienced it and you
know we we as a peer to other Executives
 
know we we as a peer to other Executives
to where this has happened there is
 
to where this has happened there is
literally like nothing you can do to
 
literally like nothing you can do to
bring those people back if their leader
 
bring those people back if their leader
is going to act that way and so what
 
is going to act that way and so what
we're what Kelly and I are really trying
 
we're what Kelly and I are really trying
to do is like don't be this leader and
 
to do is like don't be this leader and
and in fact um one of the things that I
 
and in fact um one of the things that I
like to tell my teams when they don't
 
like to tell my teams when they don't
agree with the decision is that nobody
 
agree with the decision is that nobody
knows what the future is and so you know
 
knows what the future is and so you know
a lot of times when we're thinking about
 
a lot of times when we're thinking about
these really tough
 
these really tough
decisions um I think about oneway door
 
decisions um I think about oneway door
decisions and I think about two-way door
 
decisions and I think about two-way door
decisions and so one-way door decision
 
decisions and so one-way door decision
is like we are going this way and we
 
is like we are going this way and we
cannot come back most decisions actually
 
cannot come back most decisions actually
aren't that most decisions if they are
 
aren't that most decisions if they are
two-way doors to where it's like hey we
 
two-way doors to where it's like hey we
can go test this thing and if it doesn't
 
can go test this thing and if it doesn't
work we can roll it right back the
 
work we can roll it right back the
oneway door decisions typically have to
 
oneway door decisions typically have to
do with like when your reputation is
 
do with like when your reputation is
like on the line and you need to take a
 
like on the line and you need to take a
lot of time to think about those but I
 
lot of time to think about those but I
tend to see when people don't want to
 
tend to see when people don't want to
get on board you know they want their
 
get on board you know they want their
way and I just think all of us need to
 
way and I just think all of us need to
have a lot of humility as we're going
 
have a lot of humility as we're going

through different paths and exploring
different ways that we can go about
 
different ways that we can go about

organizations that is the case as a
leadership team for transparency
 
leadership team for transparency

more transparent than feels comfortable
 
more transparent than feels comfortable
is almost always the best decision so
 
is almost always the best decision so
people can understand how decisions are
 
people can understand how decisions are
made and why they're being made that way
 
made and why they're being made that way

like they they can work through some of
the more challenging issues that have to
 
the more challenging issues that have to
