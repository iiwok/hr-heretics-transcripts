# HR Heretics Unleashed: DEI Roundtable with Colleen McCreary and David Hanrahan

## Transcript

 
think that if you're not ready to commit
to it long term you see that immediate
cut investors and board members they're
pretty transparent they're focused on
money you know I don't think that they
have a nefarious purpose to try and like
you know hold back efforts diversify
organizations I think they're going to
ask where's the money and where is this
helping us we have to find ways to make
sure it's connected to the business and
if you just can't make that case you're
going to see it thrown out but
reimagined likely as opposed to no we
don't care about diversity
anymore
[Applause]
[Music]
 
all right everybody Welcome To HR
Heretics today we have a special episode
and we're doing a Dei Round Table uh our
special guests today are Colleen mccre
and David Hanrahan they've both been on
the show before they're both friends of
me and Kelly thank you both for being on
today we greatly appreciate it so where
I'm going to start
where I'm going to start this
conversation is I'm going to go through
what I think like the general facts are
of how we got to today I want to talk
about how we have experienced de and I
and then I want to talk about where we
think the puck is going in 2024 and
Beyond so I'm going to start with a very
crude explanation of what I think the
facts are today which is number one it
is very clear with studies that
diversity improves business outcomes
that is ESP especially true for
companies that are post product Market
fit yet in major tech companies like
think of the biggest tech companies
women generally make up about 25 to 30%
of the population and black and
Hispanics account for about 12 to 15% of
the
population there's been a number of
studies that also indicate that bias in
the hiring process as well as in the
promotion process disproportionately
affects those populations and so
awareness of this issue probably started
around the late 90s early
 
publish annual diversity reports
beginning in the
 
started to see Tech employees play a
more active role in advocating for Dei
and so this is when we started to see
more employee resource groups
initiatives to improve diversity metrics
and then also the beginnings of
consultants and then specific Dei
leaders to come in and help these
companies I think the reason we're
having this conversation today is what
happened on December 5th and so there
was a a hearing on Capitol Hill with the
presidents of Harvard MIT and pen and it
was about anti-Semitism on campus people
should go watch those hearings and the
clips of those hearings and make their
own opinions
but the sound bite specifically on X
Twitter formally Twitter is that it
seems like the Jewish population is not
part of the Dei movement thus has led a
larger conversation into what are dei's
goals who is included in Dei and how do
we think about Dei moving forward so I
I'll pause there and I'll turn it over
to the group is that a general okay
statement for how the facts of this case
are is there anything else you guys
think I missed yeah I think Nolan I I
just wanted to point it out you know for
the group if you're not watching this
this is a group of white people it is
four white people who are having this
convers and Americans and I think we're
really talking a lot about American
companies in particular since de and has
a very different focus and and thoughts
and that is an important part of this
conversation too about internationally
um but the we're just all four people
people who knew each other were friends
with each other were professionally
aligned and you know we all started
chatting about it we thought we were
willing to go on the record U sort of
with you and Kelly I think David and I
have known each other a long time so um
I I just feel like that's an important
sort of overtone to as we enter the
conversation I agree um you know Nolan
in the spirit of the HR Heretics you
know philosophy on on chatting about
these things right I think we all know
each other we do have opinions on it not
everyone might agree um we also have a
lot of shared experience I think there's
 
just to share and learn and we might
disagree as well and again to the
benefit of our listeners to hear this
whether they agree or disagree but just
an informal conversation was the goal y
I totally agree so Colleen let me start
with you what is your take on the
conversation right now about
 
Dei yeah you know I am somebody who has
been thinking and talking about this
since the mid 1990s um and in fact I
think Nolan when you first posted U from
one of your podcasts about it I wrote
about I did my thesis in graduate school
on the retention of women in engineering
and computer science programs that was
in 1996 so this is not a new topic uh at
all and I don't think we have soled D
any of those same issues I think many of
the things sort of come to light um I
think we have tilted almost too far in
many directions of making it an US
versus them and many of our corporate
environments which has created an
inability to have a real dialogue about
what practices work and what practices
matter um I feel like companies now are
in the position of having to either take
sides or take no side and we also are at
a time where employees in general I
think have really lost the ability to
have hard conversations with each other
we're seeing this in our entire Society
I call it second grade playground where
you know conversations and disagreements
you used to just work out with each
other and if you ran to the teacher the
teacher would say hey go work it out
between the two of you that sounds like
a problem that you two need to work out
um and instead we have an environment
where people are running either to
social media or they're running to HR or
they're running to someone else to try
and solve what are generally sometimes
very minor disagreements about how you
approach something or how you talk to
somebody and we have stemmed to this you
know sort of place where it feels like
people want to make a rule or this H is
the way versus having an open dialogue
and being comfortable in just sort of
being who they are at work um because
they're worried about offending each
other David what's your take yeah plus
one to a lot of what Colleen said I you
know I've been thinking about a few
pieces I've read recently Roxy and
Petraeus at at a thema she's a CEO of
Athena she wrote a really um interesting
piece where she said yes Dei initiatives
are on the chopping block because many
companies didn't see them as tied to the
business and she goes on to say that you
know if these things are viewed as nice
to have versus tied to the business they
they will be on the chopping blocker and
then just recently Joel at Paradigm
wrote a really interesting piece um and
the headline is the anti- Dei movement
has gone from Fringe to mainstream and
it's a bit of a sort of contrast piece
to what Bill Amman wrote on on X last
night his 4,000-word essay um which is
basically Dei is racist um and he's
coming from the point of view of uh of
you know Jewish people being viewed as
as oppressors in in some Dei movements
is his View and so very interesting like
Stark like contrasting views um you know
I think that like some of the most most
effective um Dei efforts that I've seen
in
organizations have been um about
bringing people together have been about
unifying and I think there is a trend
around division um within um Dei efforts
more recently and I say Dei and somewhat
distinguished between diversity as a
concept um and and Dei as like
programmatic efforts within
organizations um but you know I I think
about um uh diversity done well brings
people together Joelle in her piece she
alluded to the fact that some Dei
practitioners have not allowed for space
for people genuinely seeking to learn so
if I approach a question about like Dei
from point of view of of ignorance that
is chilled conversations which what Bill
Atman talked about which is words that
we' we've constructed around Dei have
been sort of used to chill conversations
and move people out of of the
conversation on Dei to the detriment of
an effort on
diversity I think that's a great summary
of especially what's been going on over
the course of the last week or so um
Kelly what's your take yeah yeah I mean
I I wrote down some notes um before we
started today and it's funny one of the
words I wrote down was rules policies
Colleen mentioned it um I I've been
practicing this and have cared about it
since I think I started into it in 2001
and I remember shout out to Norma olos
who I still am friends with started our
first Diversity Program at it and I was
a part of that and I loved it and I've
loved it ever since um and you know just
vulnerability here I struggle because I
don't think we've made a ton of progress
like I think in a lot of ways we're
we're at the same place if not maybe
going backwards because there's more
like there's just anger out there and
there's Division and there's there's
more aggression publicly than I've seen
and I think maybe some of the world
events have sparked that and allowed for
some of that but for me like I just go
down to like the the root definition of
this diversity Equity inclusion and to
David's Point there's a lot of people
out there that think about this in all
different ways right if if you don't do
this the right way it can very much turn
um and for me the the the empius on
doing it correctly is that belonging
piece I know a lot of people have tacked
on the be to this but I do think that
belonging of doing this in a natural and
shared way is a prerequisite to be able
to do the rest of it and I know a lot of
companies over the years have used
quotas and percentage of representation
to say that we've won and we are diverse
and that has always bothered me and it
comes down to that belonging that
conversation that safety and you can't
do that if you're divided I think that a
lot of companies have have resorted and
I understand why to policies and rules
that have have led to more Division
versus Less in a lot of these ways and
we talked about that a little bit Nolan
in our our segment I think two weeks ago
yeah on the belonging side you know I
I've thought about this a lot and I
think it's it's almost impossible to
measure I think it's very
individual and and how certain people
feel like is there actually a way to to
measure that companywide have you have
you seen it done well maybe said
differently I mean I think it is very
difficult to measure and I'm going to
you know push back that that some of the
some of the best things can't be
measured like like they just can't you
you know how things are working I mean
you can look at different aspects but
you know it's it's it is something that
that not not everything underneath the
belonging can be measured via a survey
or a multiple choice or a scale it's
it's hard to say how you know what is
the actual metric around that you know
it's a little bit like I say in
recruiting acceptance rate is the metric
I pay the most attention to because I
think it's all inclusive of everybody in
the process and everything that you've
done and all these kinds of things but
then to tease out like where the issues
are you really have to then look at a
lot of metrics and a lot of things to
figure out where that's at and I would
say the best companies I've been a part
of have looked at a number of things and
and you can start with attrition and who
who is leaving and and how long have
they been there and were they considered
stars or not and who's getting promoted
and who's not getting promoted and um
what are your you know what are the
levels of people when they're coming in
and what do those look like and it's you
know I thankfully have never worked
anywhere that has had a quota saying you
have to hire X percent or those kinds of
things I think we've often had targets
that we would say hey it would be great
if we could hit these but um I've never
thankfully never had to be a part of and
I don't think I would have ever felt
comfortable saying you have to hire XYZ
I have had pressure from employee
employes certainly over the years that
have said you know why don't you have an
executive who you know like my last
management team we were all white and
Asian and there was a lot of pressure to
you know why don't we have anybody who's
of color who's black or Latino or you
know and I used to just push back and
say well who am I supposed to fire on
the management team so that I can go out
and then how do I make you know and then
am I supposed to hire someone just
because of that like you know I
literally would just say that because
felt like it had to be a very Frank
conversation um but I do think you can
look at a lot of data to see if there
are people in pockets and even tenure
you know age are there people who are
certain ages who who feel comfortable
don't feel comfortable um and gender and
a lot of other things um that we can
take a look at and you know that may not
be a big thing on percentage wise is may
not a big deal or could be I mean you
can really I think in some companies I
can look back and say yeah we had a
problem we we had women leaving at a
much higher percentage than we had men
at the same exact levels in the same
exact tenure and potentially the same
exact performance um however we were
looking at that so um and I think that
does speak to whether or not someone
feels comfortable in the environment
that they're in which is to some extent
what where I would go to basally to find
belonging hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors hey everybody your co-host
Nolan here high performance and great
culture should never be at odds they're
better together with Lis people
management platform companies

globally lce helps everyone work better
together learn why companies from slack
to the LA Dodgers choose Lattis visit
lace.com HR Heretics today that's Lattis
 
l.com have you ever had a negative

hiring exec in the middle of a search
right now or don't know how to solve a
problem I get it scaling is hard
companies like athletic greens weights
and biases misari and more than a
hundred other tech companies have turned
to Continuum for help solving their
people Ops go to market engineering and
finance challenges so check out
Continuum in the description below ping
me on LinkedIn if you have any questions
or head to join
continuum. we actually in culture amp
we've used I've used culture amp a
couple straight companies so it's just
one of many tools that does this but um
there's a question is I feel like I
belong at X and then you can look at
differences by by demographics um racial
age gender Etc and interesting on that
question that the sort of data Sciences
it has a very high impact on engagement
the other thing I think about I don't
know if there's I haven't thought enough
about this but um in terms of connection
to social isolation and loneliness
period that we're coming out of in this
pandemic the increase in per in
percentage of adults who feel alone who
spend more time alone in a day and the
impact that has on mental health and
whether organizations and whether
efforts on diversity internally can be
addressing that and be playing a role in
that it seem it seems very zeitgeisty as
well that that aspect I agree totally my
last one Nolan on that belonging piece
in addition to the lagging indicators is
um a big fan of qualitative leading
indicators right I think if if you are
trusted in the organization like I have
had Bar None n Holds Barred
conversations with folks that are like
that person's racist this is going on
like if you can and use that in the
right way but if you can gain trust and
have those real conversations you can
get an idea of what's going on um big
fan of the verbatim texts right at pendo
I think we had 900 or something com
events at one point you can actually get
get a good signal from Reading those
things and the last thing to the
belonging piece is how the organization
is spending their time how many people
are going to affinity group meetings is
it just like is it is it any of the
supporters right or or Allies is it just
folks in the group are you talking about
this stuff at your All Hands meetings
like how much is this stuff living
within the mechanics of the organization
or not is something that we've done as
well I what I'm seeing now is another
Camp of people so call this like the
Jason calacanis the Brian Armstrongs and
the the bill amans of the world say
we've spent tens of millions of dollars
uh We've rolled out brand new programs
and
initiatives the numbers and the data
haven't changed and in fact there now
appears to be a reversing uh so like hey
these are the minority groups like we
want to promote them and potentially
look at less
meritocracy and then you know the the
oppressor groups we want to hold them
back a little bit so we can help the
others come up I think that's what the
narrative I'm hearing from this other
side how do you all think about that
like how do you all think about how the
how it's gone so far and what we can do
to improve
it oh I could spend hours
spent hours on this I'll boil it down to
two areas that I I'll have a stronger
opinion on and then I'll let the others
uh first of
all I struggle still with the term
meritocracy I have for years I think
it's an ideal uh word but I think most
people and places do a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] job of it
frankly and
so I think we're really great at
identify and managers of all levels are
great at identifying Superstars and then
people who are really awful and then
there's this real messy middle that I
just don't believe that most of our
companies are really great at
distinguishing
between um and this is why you know like
I you sort of infamously or famously
depending on which side of that you're
on like I've moved to this role-based
pay Mantra and belief and you know sort
of getting rid of a lot of these you
know this person does this much better
so they get $10,000 more those kinds of
like I've looked at ways and structures
to really think about how poorly that is
done and then also though for when you
do know that there is this like
percentage of people who are truly
impacting versus performing in your
organization ways to identify and reward
those people and make sure that you know
the whole company knows that that's
important to us and our business
outcomes that we do that so I think the
meritocracy thing is a little bit
overblown um and that's a word I feel
like I've heard in tech for 25 years and
and for ever I've been like yeah I think
some people you know we're good at
identifying some people who are great
but a lot of times it doesn't matter I
think a second thing on this is I
actually agree that we have wasted a lot
of money and a lot of time even more
than money on things that just don't
work and they don't matter and I call it
window dressing I've done it at my last
few companies whenever there's been
pressure to hire a head of diversity and
where that person should sit and what
they should do and I'd be like look I'm
not doing any dressing here we're going
to do the things that matter we're going
to put the the the processes and the
tools in place and we're not going to
spend a lot of time on trying to change
people's minds that aren't going to
change their minds and never going to
change their minds um and we're not
going to just try and make people feel
better because you know we checked a
bunch of boxes we're going to go hire
we're going to go recruit at all the
HBCU because that's where you're going
to find a high number of black students
you're right you will but you know where
you find the highest number of black
students United States at state
universities if you want to go find them
they're not actually all at HBCU
percentage wise they're at state
universities and community colleges just
like every other population of student
um and you know and so I'd be like I'm
not going to do that that you know like
that's window dressing and so what I
think we could be better at is
identifying the actual tools and the
things that have worked and spending our
time on that instead of making employees
always feel better um or putting posters
on the wall just like we talk about with
values or you know I give Brian
Armstrong a lot of credit for saying
like we're not going to talk about that
here that is not going to be part of our
organization and that is a choice that
employees can make whether they stay or
go or join or not join um and I don't
actually think there's anything wrong
with that just like I don't think
there's anything wrong with that for
remote work versus non- remote work or
all of these kinds of things um I just
think we need to be clear Kelly and I
have agreed on this many times like you
just to be clear who you are and I think
what we've done
mistakenly in a lot of companies is
we've talked a lot of talk but we
haven't actually backed it up with
actions and that's when employees get
extra frustrated especially the ones
where they join thinking that these
things are going to matter and then when
you don't actually do the things that
matter I think that they get more pissed
off um and are not sure how to express
that in many ways I think it's really
well said Colleen the one thing I'll add
to what you just said is I think
companies
have more responsibility to respond to
to so much more stuff and that's really
over the course of the last four or five
years I think of covid I think of George
Floyd I think of like all of these
moments that have happened either
internationally or or locally to our
country and now like it's the company
has to respond and they haven't been
prepared they don't have a stance on
these things and so then they follow
along with what everyone else does and
then they don't follow up on those
actions and employees are like well who
the hell are we and so I think it's
really well set of figuring out who you
are and and being super clear about that
at the outset or if not at the outset
now because like people want to know who
are they working for yeah and I just
before you know David and and Kelly I
want you to respond as well but when I
was at Credit Karma and we did a lot of
very Progressive things and important
because of the customer base that we had
and the product that we made and what
our mission was as an organization so a
lot of the things that we were also
doing and talking about were actually
very connected to the business um that
we were in but I remember when the
George Floyd conversations started to
happen internally and we had were
already building and put into place what
I thought were actually best-of class
processes across the board and many we
had this role-based pay we documented
every promotion process we you know had
job architectures we had um structured
interviewing I mean
I can name probably 10 or 15 things that
we were doing that were in my opinion
like these are things that we know will
actually work and move the needle to do
the right think it's not perfect but
certainly do that and I actually felt
like quitting because employees were so
angry that we weren't changing
everything and throwing everything away
and where why aren't you you know why
aren't you requiring a slate of
candidates for every role or why aren't
we recruiting at all these hbcs or why
aren't we doing that I I was just so
frustrated for a while and that's my own
you know internal inadequacy and and
level of patience and and you know lack
of confidence or whatever you want to
talk about at the time but I actually
felt like quitting like I should just go
somewhere else and I would start to roll
these things out and people would be
like happy and celebrating me and
instead I just felt like I was getting
beaten
down for for months if not longer over
things that were really you know sort of
and you know other people in our
organization we all you know sort of had
lots of experience with this aligned um
but there was nothing I could do to
appease a employees that felt like for a
while and I just you know I really went
through a point of like I don't I don't
know if I want to do this anymore you
know it was really hard I don't I don't
think you're alone in that I mean we I
mean it's been the last three years a
lot a lot of us you jacked out because
you just you can't be all things to all
people and it becomes so weighing um
that it just wears you down um but and
I'd love your your your all's reaction
to this I could not agree more with the
money wasted on things we saw the
Articles around you know meta Etc
pulling back um and the window dressing
and Nolan you said something that others
follow along like I I I very much
believe that a lot not all not all
because there are leaders and
organizations out there that are doing
this well and doing this right and get
it because it is critical but a lot of
folks have done it to follow along
because everyone else is doing it I have
to do it I'm GNA check the box by hiring
a Dei leader we're gonna go work with a
firm we're going to put money at it and
Implement
programs but the only way those programs
work is if people make them work and the
only way that people make them work is
they have behaviors and commitment to
talk about it and make them work and I I
just don't think
that that's been the case and my proof
of that is when George Floyd and all
these things started to roll I saw deer
and headlights paralysis what do I do
what do I say like clearly the the the
right work wasn't happening like I think
it a lot of it was window dressing some
was not but that's what I'm challenging
is that can can we in the next phase of
this change it maybe it's less money and
more freaking time and
conversation but I do think there's been
a lot of that even in the organizations
I've been a part of in the past you know
just to be very honest and it's it's a
hard thing just to fix not saying like
you know it's just but I do think that
is a phenomenon if I back up and look at
the last 15 years or so there has been a
lot of that David where you at with
resources and how we've been allocating
them you know um I feel that in terms of
um as di efforts just the past few
companies I've been part of have gotten
off the ground there has been resources
ahead of there's been a Machinery
there's been a training investment and
um Dei is such a long-term effort that
like when when boards or executive teams
are short-term focused you don't see
something there it's like I can't see
the benefit of this for us right now it
like a lot of things will will face Cuts
I I know that indeed said that 44% the
job Dei related job postings are down
 
and and so um I've definitely seen that
before and I kind of think about so
Performance Management let's take Dei
comparative Performance Management CEO
wants a high performing company they
also want a company that's diverse they
know the benefits of that relative to
Consumers they know that they for high
performing company good things will
follow Performance Management is the
mechanism that we rely on for for
performance in the company and yet what
we see like Jack dorsy and block
throwing it out you know just like hey
I'm going to completely scrap this and
is that saying he doesn't want a high
performing company no it's saying the
effort that they're pursuing at that
time for him it's just not seeing
something here pay out for us which I I
know in Performance Management happens a
lot of times where we do all this work
and nothing happens I think that if
you're not ready to commit to it long
term you see that immediate cut
investors and board members they're
pretty transparent they're focused on
money you know I don't think that they
have a nefarious purpose to try and like
you know hold back efforts diversify
organizations I think they're going to
ask where's the money and where is this
helping us and so um we have to find
ways to make sure it's connected to the
business and if you just can't make that
case like you know Rox in um I talked
about you're gonna you're going to see
it um thrown out but reimagined likely
as opposed to no we don't want to we
don't care about diversity
anymore I I couldn't agree with you more
I think the one piece we're not talking
about right now all of us have
pre IPO Tech experience it's the
majority of of my career and and the
same with you all those companies are
typically run by the founder and I think
a lot of Founders
were not fully on board with doing these
Investments and going up going along
with it and then but because everyone
else was they had to as well otherwise
they would face internal and external
pressure and there's been a ton of these
uh stories that have come out uh in the
Press about how companies are operating
internally and you know every company's
a mess right but Founders I don't think
have been 100% on board a couple have
and you could see some of these
companies very clearly from the outside
I think a firm is one of them uh what
you all did at Credit Karma certainly
like you can see from the outside the
ones that are like fully invested sauna
is another one that I think of right off
the top of my head but then there's
everyone else and everyone else felt
like they were just kind of going along
with what the narrative was in tech and
now it's a moment for them to be like
hey I actually wasn't on board with this
thing to begin with now let's like
decommit let's let's completely stop
investing into this thing to your point
David I think it's like this pendulum
right and the Pendulum is now swung
completely towards let's do away with it
and the question now becomes how does it
get reimagined like where what is
what is the right answer and I'll just
start I don't think there is one I think
it's like the pursuit of an endless goal
and I think that's where everyone has to
get comfortable with this is like this
is not going to change over the course
of a year a couple years decades we've
already been at this this is like never
ending but how we Institute it I'm
curious to get your all's input on this
how do we start to Institute this going
forward and
where where do we see the puck going
with Dei in the
 
future so I I do I do hear so I'm now in
a position where I work with a lot of
Founders and I do hear them still talk
about wanting it I mean I have Botha I
have I see a rainbow of options in this
and interest and passion and I think
potentially even just generationally
there's a group of people who grew up
that this is something they think
they're supposed to do and they just are
doing it or they've heard about it or
they think it'll be better for their
brand and that's what they're choosing
and that's the path
and I I think it really goes back
to deciding who you are and who you want
to be and how you want to operate in
your company and you can change that but
then just being very clear about it
and I really think it goes back to the
systems and the processes that you put
in place if you hire everybody who
worked at the same company before you're
going to have the same systems and
processes that came from the company
that everybody worked at before I mean I
I think it's not unlike a lot of other
things um your recruiting practices are
going to look very similar to oh I
recruited from blah blah blah and that's
the only way to go I think comp ends up
that way I think Performance Management
to David's Point ends up that way I
think um and I think de and I ends up in
the same camp and that's why we end up
throwing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the wall and just
saying like well that's what the last
company did or all these other companies
did so it must work instead of stepping
back and saying like what are we trying
to do what are all of the options in the
toolkit to do this and which ones will
work for us that's hard it takes time it
takes expertise you you you know you
have to bring in or have other voices at
the table or be willing to listen to
other
options um and it is longterm and you
might not see how it's actually working
for a while and we are and you know Tech
in general more than I think a lot of
other Industries is very are very
impatient and so you know are we willing
to stick with that if it's new you know
I if I look back at my role based pay
thing the fact that some founder CEO let
me do that after being at a company for
six months and i' never tried it before
I'd never seen it you know I sort of was
working with the team to come up with
this idea of how to how to do it is
insane actually if I if I think back but
part of it was we they had so many
problems and there only 400ish people
when I was there they had so many
problems with compensation and it was so
noisy and it was so painful that they
were willing to try anything and I think
this is one of those other areas where
you are going to find people who it's so
painful or they just want to try
something who will innovate and come up
with some ideas and whether or not we
can get those to gain traction or
adoption is a whole a whole other story
but let's be real too we have made
progress I don't want to I'm thinking
back
to David worked at EA when I was there I
don't there was a VP there when I was
pregnant and I said oh you know oh I'm
you know I'm blah blah blah I'm pregnant
I think I was finally looking pregnant
and he was like oh I wondered why you
weren't just getting fat oh okay and
then when I came back to work he was
like don't worry all that weight's gonna
come off you and then slapped me on my
ass and and kick me out of my way I
didn't think that I was gonna run to HR
I just thought he was like a dirty old
man and you know thank God he wasn't
managing a ton of people and I wasn't in
HR yet but you know also
like I didn't think anything about it
but I don't think that that would happen
as often now so I'm glad to hear that I
also had a manager who at one point in
time uh I managed a team of a bunch of
Engineers all males and one of them had
very poor metrics and I gave him a very
low review score and he complained to my
manager that the reason that his metrics
were poor is he was distracted because
my shirts were too tight as his manager
at which my manager gave me that
feedback and told me to wear looser
shirts so I got to tell
we've come a long way and I do think
there is a world that we should remind
people as well that like progress takes
time and it's going to be a long time
and we can't expect everybody to change
their behavior overnight but we can
identify when things are not correct and
we can put things in place and some of
these very very blatant things we can
just we we do now say like that is not
cool we are not doing that and that is
not acceptable here which is something I
think that happened on December 5th that
they should have said it is not okay to
say that people don't deserve to live
like there's no context to that like
that would have been a very easy thing
we should have just done it that is a
great point the the standards for
Behavior have definitely improved you're
right um you know Nolan your question is
very difficult you know and I I would I
would hope that humans are logical
enough that it's not a it's not an on or
off button it's not we're doing it or
we're not and I I very much hope that
this this wave doesn't kind of swoop in
a bunch of we're done like that that is
the wrong answer um I do think we we do
need to evolve and I guess my my two
cents on that
is to maybe stop expecting every company
to be great at this right I I to
Colleen's point you you choose who you
are
and sometimes it takes fewer great
examples to make bigger change than
everyone kind of playing along with
something and so for me right it's like
if I if I go into an operator role again
at some point you choose that company
where the behavior is first not the
money in the programs when the rubber
hits the road the pressure and the
short-term things come up do you make
that exception for x or not and I think
that those companies those people exist
and I I hope they
Rise um and we can follow what they're
doing differently perhaps in a different
way than the window dressing we talked
about before that's a great great call O
Kelly um I I read an interview with Deb
blue CEO of ancestry the other day and
the very first question from the
interviewer is what are you most looking
forward to in 2024 she said two things
Global expansion and furthering Dei
efforts we're continuously working to
bring our products and new regions
across the world we're also looking to
further our Dei efforts internally with
our platform because bringing diverse
voices and stories to the table only
strengthen our business and product and
I I think like when you have that in the
in the top like this is like I'm I'm
activated I get it like this is a
passion for me there's a lot of progress
can be made when it's feeling as though
I'm pushing this up the hill and it's
not on the priority you know for the
executive team you know then it then
it's maybe not going to be a strength
that emerges from us two years from now
when we're back in hiring mode and like
gosh I wish we made this a priority back
then so you know to Kelly's point and
Ken you st this as well I think there's
going to be probably smaller numberers
that are passionate that actually to
their to their credit Will emerge with
strength on this because they've they've
chosen when others were going this way
we're gonna actually choose to double
down on our efforts and we're maybe
going to do it a little bit differently
than others have done the Colleen a
couple things that you said that I
thought were just so great is like
behaviors have changed now they're not
perfect but they absolutely have changed
my mom was a paralal growing up when I
was eight years old I got chickenpox she
took the day off to like take me to the
doctor and she was terminated for taking
that day off and so like that today it
does happen but not near to the amount
that it happened in the past um I I also
want to say that like companies are
imperfect you know I think employees
feel like the leadership cabal like has
all the answer and it turns out they
don't like it turns out they're figuring
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out as they go along and and
learning and tinkering and experimenting
with things but I really agree with what
you said said about choosing who you are
I will add to that and say you have to
deal with the tradeoffs once you
choose and your point around because I
tried I tried rooll base pay and what I
didn't realized when I tried it is that
managers would absolutely hate not
having discretion to for their own teams
I I didn't realize it and I got so much
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pressure that we had to do away
with the program like
immediately because they were like well
I can't reward my top performers and
like are we're going to lose our best
people none of that was we we weren't
losing people they were just projecting
their dislike for the program and it
became clear to me that it was like this
is a non-starter here and and so if you
say you want
to um have equality of opportunity then
that needs to show up in your pro
programs if you say you want to be
inclusive as a culture then that needs
to show up in your programs and you need
to be okay when things outside of that
like you can't just you can't be
everything for everybody I think Kelly
you said that really well earlier and
let employees vote with their
feet if they want to be there great
they'll stay if not they should leave
and it's better for everybody I just saw
on Twitter the other day I just saw on
Twitter the other day that was like um
uh 5% of employees caused 95% of like
the internal problems internally and I
was like oh my God like that resonates
so deeply and instead of trying to cater
to those people just let them go please
let them go like that does it they're
not they're not happy we're not happy
and it's not the company we want to be
and we shouldn't try to cater to them oh
yeah I I mean I'm infamous for the on
the bus off the bus like you can choose
to get you are adult adults we're
talking about adults like you you can
choose to get off this bus any day uh we
will welcome that for you and thank you
for your service I don't have any issue
with that whatsoever uh and I think when
you know I've said this I think publicly
before in some things like when you
build I said oh and I build programs
there's 10% of the haters and I just
ignore them and there are 10% of the
always love everything and I ignore them
too like just focus on the 80% in the
middle and know that like someone's
going to hate me and someone's going to
love me and I can't tune to either of
those or nothing will ever get done I
mean I and you know I love to talk about
the gray Nolan and kind of how things
aren't always easy we make it that some
people might be listening and say what a
bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that sounds like that
made sound very easy it's really hard to
do like right we've all been in the
pre-ipo companies with firsttime founder
CEOs and they're all over the place and
they're pressured and they're confused
they've never worked with people they've
never scaled a company they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
and they're like ah and that employee
pressure can be very daunting and very
real I mean I felt it especially early
in my career and it's very easy to say
oh just kidding oh yeah you're right oh
yeah we're gonna be this now and I
empathize with that and so I just offer
that that is a journey that is almost
like a skill set that might come with
gray hair and scars and maybe not caring
as much what everyone thinks but getting
to that point you can't just say great
we're going to do this tomorrow so it
that is a journey in itself friends
outside of work that's what I'm say
friends outside of work I'm good with
that there was probably a moment for
many Like Chief people officers and CEOs
in the past couple years when it was
like every week there's like hey are you
going to comment on the societal issue
going on right now and it's like I don't
know anything about Ukraine why why we
don't even have employees there like why
and and there was like light bul moments
where like you know what we're going to
have to choose who who we are and who
we're not and and you know sort of what
our what our
in our culture what's important to us
because you can't be everything I think
right now because so many companies have
gone through risks this year um the
culture has been disrupted and who we
are like who who is remaining with us um
you know what their sentiment is it's a
lot of sort of ripeness for like going
back to who you are your values your
culture um diversity may be very central
part for for many companies as they as
they re think about that again um but
that's an important area for I think
cpos to go to when you've gone through
that much
change yeah I I totally agree and it
might make things easier I mean jumping
into that now will help you later so
take advantage of that time actually see
it as an opportunity not a daunting
terrible thing yeah you're you're so
right about like the the riffs have I
think encouraged a large swath of
companies to just not care about this
stuff and if you are building a real
business like now is actually the time
to figure it out uh versus like oh like
all we care about is making profit like
that's that's not going to sustain it's
not going to drive your best people like
you do need to figure out what you stand
for and what you don't I want to just I
want to end with um just looking forward
to this year and and what you all think
I'll just lead with what I think um my
take is is that the the pendulum it
feels like it's completely swinging the
other way I I do think we're going to
start to see more of a a a swing to the
middle I have been a part of companies
that have said for this role we are
hiring this gender and I think that
those sorts of things are going away um
they are illegal but like that has
happened if you talk to exec recruiters
they will tell you that has happened
over the course of the last five to 10
years I think that's going to go away I
think the other thing that we're going
to see a lot more of is even though it
feels really polarizing right now and it
feels like you have to like choose these
like two separate camps of what side are
you on I think more people are actually
going to realize that they have a lot
more in common with each other and that
ultimately like people are good to their
core and they want equality of
opportunity and I think we're going to
start focusing a lot more on equality of
opportunity uh this year as opposed to
equality of outcome which I don't think
is going to be part of the narrative
moving forward what do you guys think
that's really well said
um there was a prediction from the neuro
leadership Institute that Dei in 2024 is
going to be uh more of an expectation of
leadership as opposed to Standalone
efforts um and this is kind of goes back
to you know like the the CEO's Chief
diversity officer you know when I think
about the best Dei practitioners so
people who are passionate about it who
want this to be their career some of the
greatest success I've seen from um from
di practitioners has been in community
building so in bringing people who have
like natural differences there's awkward
there's tension here bringing them
together to to basically make better
teams to make the company better to to
create to strengthen bonds internally
where you have different languages
spoken coming from different like
wildely different point of views like we
acquired this company and there's this
tension there's this Discord you know
really good Dei practitioners I've seen
are Community Builders and we need that
um in the organizations that are sort
coming out of this year fractured you
know Rift disrupted in society what
we're seeing in terms of fractures
there's a there's a big need for
community building and perhaps you know
in the reimagining of De I as it sort of
faces some headwinds there's a
reimagining here much like Performance
Management gets reimagined every once in
a while maybe there's something there
that emerges with strength I agree my my
my two cents you know de practitioners
just like HR practitioners right they
are the facilitators of this they are
not the owners of um just as people
officers are the facilitators of culture
they do not own culture in my opinion so
I think I completely agree with you
David on that front um my two s also is
I think the most success we're going to
see is that organizations are becoming
more human uh the last three years have
been extremely hard and and I've
personally seen and felt and heard More
Humans interacting as humans through
this in Sharing stories or hardships or
successes or just helping each other
emotionally and talking versus these
lumbering programs and I think that that
middleware of all this is going to help
help this go in the right
direction yeah I would plus one to
everybody um I do think the other piece
of this is we are going to see a
continued conversation and I think
companies are going to get forced into
stating more clearly who they are and
what they stand for which I actually
think is a good thing I I think the you
know I'm going to keep banging this drum
but like speak out say Who You Are be
okay with it and let people make those
choices for themselves um instead of all
of the followon and this is the way we
have to do it um I would love for de and
I to not be a thing honestly like I I
used to chafe at the idea that this is
an HR thing and it sits in HR or reports
the CEO or whatever like I think it just
really Waters down the message over time
and the the more I talk about it and I
have worked with some amazing de and I
both leaders and outside folks who come
in and create these great dialogues and
give us some ideas on great practices
and people want to contact me I'm more
than happy to refer you to some of those
people who do the process work
well um but at the end of the day you
know to your point Kelly this isn't
something that it sits in HR and HR has
to own it either happens because we
decide that we are all committed to
these are the practices that we believe
in and this is how we're going to
operate or you don't and that is
internally as well as externally so
don't go putting all sorts of pretty
faces on your website if that is not who
you are um and stop pretending and you
know same things happen all over the
place I got a senior in high school
right now and I'm in the middle of the
college search and you know I will say
like we did visit you know we visited
probably 20 something universities and
we were on a college tour somewhere and
my son turned to me and said this is the
whitest School we've ever been to and I
I did say like oh yeah you're right like
yeah they didn't even try like there was
even none of the tour guides none of the
students like okay and I said but at
least you know who they are like you can
use that in your decision- making um and
so you know I think we should just be be
more real and be more honest and I think
employees because of all the layoffs and
because of what's been going on are
going to be smarter about this over time
um and start to own more of those
choices yep and and ultimately it's on
them of what where do you want to work
vote with your feet you vote with your
feet so look it this is the it's we're
in January of of
 
discussions around this topic this year
and beyond our commitment is we're going
to continue to have this conversation
even though if I'm being really honest
it's super uncomfortable it's tough to
have this conversation it's words get
misrepresented I'm sure we said things
here that weren't worded perfectly but
the intent of the Pod is to open up the
dialogue and to actually have a
discussion and so I just want to thank
Colleen and David from the bottom of my
heart for having this discussion with us
uh for for really like going into
Uncharted Territory because these
conversations haven't been allowed in
our discourse in our industry like this
so that's our commitment for me and
Kelly and so thank you to you guys we
will have more of these conversations
coming out this year here and I can't
wait to hear your feedback on this
episode plus one thank you both so much
thanks for having us thank you thanks
