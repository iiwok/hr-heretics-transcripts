vulnerability here I struggle because I
 
vulnerability here I struggle because I
don't think we've made a ton of progress
 
don't think we've made a ton of progress
like I think in a lot of ways we're
 
like I think in a lot of ways we're
we're at the same place if not maybe
 
we're at the same place if not maybe
going backwards because there's more
 
going backwards because there's more
like there's just anger out there and
 
like there's just anger out there and
there's Division and there's there's
 
there's Division and there's there's
more aggression publicly than I've seen

and I think maybe some of the world
events have sparked that and allowed for
 
events have sparked that and allowed for
some of that but for me like I just go
 
some of that but for me like I just go
down to like the the root definition of
 
down to like the the root definition of
this diversity Equity inclusion and to
 
this diversity Equity inclusion and to
David's Point there's a lot of people
 
David's Point there's a lot of people

um and for me the the the empius on
 
um and for me the the the empius on
doing it correctly is that belonging
 
doing it correctly is that belonging
piece I know a lot of people have tacked
 
piece I know a lot of people have tacked
on the be to this but I do think that
 
on the be to this but I do think that
belonging of doing this in a natural and
 
belonging of doing this in a natural and
shared way is a prerequisite to be able
 
shared way is a prerequisite to be able
to do the rest of it and I know a lot of
 
to do the rest of it and I know a lot of
companies over the years have used
 
companies over the years have used
quotas and percentage of representation
 
quotas and percentage of representation
to say that we've won and we are diverse
 
to say that we've won and we are diverse
and that has always bothered me and it
 
and that has always bothered me and it
comes down to that belonging that
 
comes down to that belonging that
conversation that safety and you can't
 
conversation that safety and you can't
do that if you're divided I think that a
 
do that if you're divided I think that a
lot of companies have have resorted and
 
lot of companies have have resorted and
I understand why to policies and rules
 
I understand why to policies and rules
that have have led to more Division
 
that have have led to more Division

measure I think it's very
 
measure I think it's very
individual and and how certain people
 
individual and and how certain people
feel like is there actually a way to to
 
feel like is there actually a way to to
measure that companywide have you have
 
measure that companywide have you have
you seen it done well maybe said
 
you seen it done well maybe said
differently I mean I think it is very
 
differently I mean I think it is very
difficult to measure and I'm going to
 
difficult to measure and I'm going to
you know push back that that some of the
 
you know push back that that some of the
some of the best things can't be
 
some of the best things can't be
measured like like they just can't you
 
measured like like they just can't you
you know how things are working I mean
 
you know how things are working I mean
you can look at different aspects but
 
you can look at different aspects but
you know it's it's it is something that
 
you know it's it's it is something that
that not not everything underneath the
 
that not not everything underneath the
belonging can be measured via a survey
 
belonging can be measured via a survey
or a multiple choice or a scale it's
 
or a multiple choice or a scale it's
it's hard to say how you know what is
 
it's hard to say how you know what is

the process and everything that you've
 
the process and everything that you've
done and all these kinds of things but
 
done and all these kinds of things but
then to tease out like where the issues
 
then to tease out like where the issues
are you really have to then look at a
 
are you really have to then look at a
lot of metrics and a lot of things to
 
lot of metrics and a lot of things to
figure out where that's at and I would
 
figure out where that's at and I would

not doing any dressing here we're going
 
not doing any dressing here we're going
to do the things that matter we're going
 
to do the things that matter we're going
to put the the the processes and the

the top of my head but then there's
everyone else and everyone else felt
 
everyone else and everyone else felt
like they were just kind of going along
 
like they were just kind of going along
with what the narrative was in tech and

David I think it's like this pendulum
right and the Pendulum is now swung
 
right and the Pendulum is now swung
completely towards let's do away with it
 
completely towards let's do away with it
and the question now becomes how does it
 
and the question now becomes how does it
get reimagined like where what is
 
get reimagined like where what is
what is the right answer and I'll just
 
what is the right answer and I'll just
start I don't think there is one I think
 
start I don't think there is one I think
it's like the pursuit of an endless goal
 
it's like the pursuit of an endless goal
and I think that's where everyone has to
 
and I think that's where everyone has to
get comfortable with this is like this
 
get comfortable with this is like this
is not going to change over the course
 
is not going to change over the course
of a year a couple years decades we've
 
of a year a couple years decades we've
already been at this this is like never
 
already been at this this is like never
ending but how we Institute it I'm
 
ending but how we Institute it I'm
curious to get your all's input on this
 
curious to get your all's input on this
how do we start to Institute this going
 
how do we start to Institute this going
forward and
 
forward and
where where do we see the puck going
 
where where do we see the puck going
with Dei in the
 
future so I I do I do hear so I'm now in
 
future so I I do I do hear so I'm now in
a position where I work with a lot of
 
a position where I work with a lot of
Founders and I do hear them still talk
 
Founders and I do hear them still talk
about wanting it I mean I have Botha I
 
about wanting it I mean I have Botha I
have I see a rainbow of options in this
 
have I see a rainbow of options in this
and interest and passion and I think
 
and interest and passion and I think
potentially even just generationally
 
potentially even just generationally
there's a group of people who grew up
 
there's a group of people who grew up
that this is something they think
 
that this is something they think
they're supposed to do and they just are
 
they're supposed to do and they just are
doing it or they've heard about it or
 
doing it or they've heard about it or
they think it'll be better for their
 
they think it'll be better for their
brand and that's what they're choosing
 
brand and that's what they're choosing
and that's the path
 
and that's the path
and I I think it really goes back
 
and I I think it really goes back
to deciding who you are and who you want
 
to deciding who you are and who you want
to be and how you want to operate in
 
to be and how you want to operate in
your company and you can change that but
 
your company and you can change that but
then just being very clear about it
 
then just being very clear about it
and I really think it goes back to the
 
and I really think it goes back to the
systems and the processes that you put
 
systems and the processes that you put
in place if you hire everybody who
 
in place if you hire everybody who
worked at the same company before you're
 
worked at the same company before you're
going to have the same systems and
 
going to have the same systems and
processes that came from the company
 
processes that came from the company
that everybody worked at before I mean I
 
that everybody worked at before I mean I
I think it's not unlike a lot of other
 
I think it's not unlike a lot of other
things um your recruiting practices are

people as well that like progress takes
 
people as well that like progress takes
time and it's going to be a long time
 
time and it's going to be a long time
and we can't expect everybody to change
 
and we can't expect everybody to change
their behavior overnight but we can
 
their behavior overnight but we can
identify when things are not correct and
 
identify when things are not correct and
we can put things in place and some of
 
we can put things in place and some of
these very very blatant things we can
 
these very very blatant things we can
just we we do now say like that is not
 
just we we do now say like that is not
cool we are not doing that and that is
 
cool we are not doing that and that is
not acceptable here which is something I
 
not acceptable here which is something I

like there's no context to that like
that would have been a very easy thing
 
that would have been a very easy thing
we should have just done it that is a
 
we should have just done it that is a
great point the the standards for

right um you know Nolan your question is
 
right um you know Nolan your question is
very difficult you know and I I would I
 
very difficult you know and I I would I
would hope that humans are logical

enough that it's not a it's not an on or
 
enough that it's not a it's not an on or
off button it's not we're doing it or
 
off button it's not we're doing it or
we're not and I I very much hope that
 
we're not and I I very much hope that
this this wave doesn't kind of swoop in
 
this this wave doesn't kind of swoop in
a bunch of we're done like that that is
 
a bunch of we're done like that that is
the wrong answer um I do think we we do
 
the wrong answer um I do think we we do
need to evolve and I guess my my two
 
need to evolve and I guess my my two
cents on that
 
cents on that

examples to make bigger change than
 
examples to make bigger change than
everyone kind of playing along with
 
everyone kind of playing along with

take advantage of that time actually see
it as an opportunity not a daunting
 
it as an opportunity not a daunting
terrible thing yeah you're you're so
 
terrible thing yeah you're you're so
right about like the the riffs have I
 
right about like the the riffs have I
think encouraged a large swath of
 
think encouraged a large swath of
companies to just not care about this
 
companies to just not care about this
stuff and if you are building a real
 
stuff and if you are building a real
business like now is actually the time
 
business like now is actually the time
to figure it out uh versus like oh like
 
to figure it out uh versus like oh like
all we care about is making profit like
 
all we care about is making profit like
that's that's not going to sustain it's
 
that's that's not going to sustain it's
not going to drive your best people like
 
not going to drive your best people like
you do need to figure out what you stand

want to end with um just looking forward
to this year and and what you all think
 
to this year and and what you all think
I'll just lead with what I think um my
 
I'll just lead with what I think um my
take is is that the the pendulum it
 
take is is that the the pendulum it
feels like it's completely swinging the
 
feels like it's completely swinging the
other way I I do think we're going to
 
other way I I do think we're going to
start to see more of a a a swing to the
 
start to see more of a a a swing to the
middle I have been a part of companies
 
middle I have been a part of companies
that have said for this role we are
 
that have said for this role we are
hiring this gender and I think that
 
hiring this gender and I think that
those sorts of things are going away um
 
those sorts of things are going away um
they are illegal but like that has
 
they are illegal but like that has
happened if you talk to exec recruiters
 
happened if you talk to exec recruiters
they will tell you that has happened
 
they will tell you that has happened
over the course of the last five to 10
 
over the course of the last five to 10
years I think that's going to go away I
 
years I think that's going to go away I
think the other thing that we're going
 
think the other thing that we're going
to see a lot more of is even though it
 
to see a lot more of is even though it
feels really polarizing right now and it
 
feels really polarizing right now and it
feels like you have to like choose these
 
feels like you have to like choose these
like two separate camps of what side are
 
like two separate camps of what side are
you on I think more people are actually
 
you on I think more people are actually
going to realize that they have a lot
 
going to realize that they have a lot
more in common with each other and that
 
more in common with each other and that
ultimately like people are good to their
 
ultimately like people are good to their
core and they want equality of
 
core and they want equality of
opportunity and I think we're going to
 
opportunity and I think we're going to
start focusing a lot more on equality of
 
start focusing a lot more on equality of
opportunity uh this year as opposed to
 
opportunity uh this year as opposed to
equality of outcome which I don't think
 
equality of outcome which I don't think
