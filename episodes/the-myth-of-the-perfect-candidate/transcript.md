all right everyone how are you doing
welcome to another segment of HR
Heretics we are going to Brand something
new today we've been doing this for a
while Nolan but I think it's time to
kind of brand the Dear Abby column here
I'm dating myself for those of you who
remember the dear Abbey advice columns
and
probably call it dear Heretics but we've
been getting a lot of questions recently
hypotheticals real right give me the
straight answer what is this situation
how do you all think about it and first
want to ask for yall to keep sending
those because they're really really
really fun and helpful to walk through
you can LinkedIn us I finally got my act
together Nolan put my website up so you
can send me directly a message uh Kelly
dragovich decom but please keep those
coming because they're really fun really
helpful so we're going to kick off the
dear ABY segment here and here's the
question noan you ready yep hi Kelly I
was wondering if I can get your advice
I'm interviewing at a tech company and
some feedback I got from the recruiter
is that the hiring manager believes I
can do the job at their current size
it's a similar size to the current
company I lead but they're not sure if I
can run the HR organization as they grow
exponentially as I have not been the
head of HR for a larger company although
I have worked worked in larger companies
previously but in an hrbp
capacity any advice on the differences
and what I should consider in scaling
and anything I should work on to better
position myself for that position and
that
growth
okay all right so as a former recruiter
I'm going to say something
controversial which is you're talking to
the wrong
person and I find that when recruiters
deliver that sort of feedback there's
always something underneath the surface
that you are missing because you're not
actually talking to the person who had
the feedback you're talking to an
intermediary and so I don't know exactly
where you're at in this interview
process but one of the things that I
like to do just in any sort of business
deal is to remove the intermediary now
it's not like doing it disrespectfully
it's not like cold shouldering the
recruiter but it is like if you got that
piece of feedback and you were rejected
right then what I would do is like I
would actually ping the hiring manager
thank them so much for their time and
ask them to jump on a quick call to get
more specific feedback so then you can
learn and ask follow-up questions which
is always where the meat is if you're
still in the process right then great
let's figure out a way to talk to the
hiring manager and talk about how that
feedback how it's showing up for them
because then you can arm yourself better
if which and this is the last piece and
I think this happens to more people than
we realize because it happened to one of
my friends last week uh which is if you
haven't even had a conversation with the
hiring manager or the interview panels
and the recruiter is telling you this
stuff the recruiter is basically like
the way to think about them is like the
NFL draft all these people have like
these clipboards and they just have like
boxes that they're checking on the list
of like what they're looking for and
attributes you know it turns out in
business that list is entirely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
made up we don't actually know what
makes a great employee and so you need
to get past that recruiter that's what
needs to happen is you need to get past
that recruiter and you need to talk to
somebody from the company uh and so
that's what I would initially say to
this question Kelly yeah yeah it's a
great point on the recruiters and
nothing against recruiters right we love
recruiters totally however sometimes and
sometimes it's not even their fault you
know things are misrepresented
misunderstood certain attributes or
criteria get over exaggerated or you
know less exaggerated and so they're
throwing out like candidates that
actually might be great Raw Talent with
amazing aptitude for these roles so I
couldn't agree with you more on talking
to the hiring manager because a lot of
times situations like this it's the
person and the personality and the
aptitude and the the mindset it's not
the experience and the titles on a
paper right
yep exactly the the other piece I'll
just quickly mention Kelly there
is you know some of these recruiters are
so busy right now that they don't
actually have time to push back on
hiring manager
requirements and you know Kelly you know
I've been in these conversations for
years but hiring manager requirements is
always like the dumbest conversation you
ever have inside of a company right you
show up you show up to the first you
know we're going to open the wreck up
we're going to have like our first open
wreck meeting and the hiring manager is
like listing like literally like 37
different pieces of criteria that must
be true totally and you're like okay
great I just did a LinkedIn search and
it turns out there's literally zero
people in the world yeah that has like
all of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you just asked for
yeah and so let's go through that list
and let's like take a few things out
because that's not going to fly I
actually think just to have empathy for
recrui just like given everything that's
gone on over the last couple of years
they've been impacted yes at a
disproportional rate as part of these
reductions in forces and so you're
talking about a team that is incredibly
lean right now and so often times when
they're dealing with hiring managers
they don't have the bandwidth to put
back push back often times when H
managers are delivering feedback they
don't have the time to like really dig
deep to figure out what's actually going
on right and so again all respect for
Recruiters in the world but just
understanding the moment that these
folks are in right now I think it's if
you especially if you are a director
plus candidate you got to get to the
hiring manager in order to get the real
fee yeah and I agree and I think in my
experience and about you but I feel like
candidates can give more credit to the
thoughtfulness of these processes and
this criteria than actually H has has
happened and again no one's fault Etc
but they'll kind of take this feedback
as the word of God and it's like what
then the hiring manager could change
their mind every other day and it's just
chaotic and so again my advice on that
is anticipate that like how could this
person who sent this in actually
probably anticipate some of this
feedback or some of these beliefs
because this is a quite common one you
know what I mean and get in front of it
with the conversation with that hiring
manager in different ways that's really
good feedback Kelly I I totally agree
with you it's like we all know you know
if if you were to think about your own
resume you all know like what the
greatest hits are totally you also know
where your gaps are and I think being
able to speak
proactively about your gaps and how you
Ma how you going to manage those and
round those out versus just saying like
this is a gap like without a plan to
address it I think that's a really good
strategy that I I don't think I've seen
deployed very often
yeah like when I was kind of midcareer
it would be like listen I'm going to go
talk to these folks you know we'll take
the Yahoo example I was interviewing
from into it to Yahoo for a larger job I
was like great what are all the reasons
that they would hire me for this in two
seconds based on things I can do with my
eyes closed wonderful what are some of
the potential concerns they'd have based
on anything number years of experience
groups you've worked with sizes what
you've been involved in like just try to
poke holes in yourself as much as you
can use others use us to help you do
that if you need to but it's really
helpful to have that because you might
proactively bring up things that the
hiring manager or the recruiter didn't
even think of that they might think of
later or not and youve address them
proactively which is another win yeah
that reminds me of one of my favorite
quotes which is you can't show up with a
problem without a
solution totally and each of us knows
like what our gaps are and so our new
rule for Heretics listeners is you can't
show up to an interview with a known Gap
without a story of how you're going to
address it hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
t leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
quora and check out medavie head over to
metav vi. a/ Heretics to talk to one of
metav View's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled in
minutes yeah and the last thing I gave
advice on this is that in
hrbp kind of in a very influential hrbp
role in a larger company is a great role
to talk about a CPO role right you
you've basically been in a mini CPO role
if done well at this larger company you
didn't own the centers of excellence you
didn't own recruiting you didn't own
comp you didn't own L&amp;D but presumably
were very active in working with them if
not co- collaborating on work and
programs and implementation and all the
things and so you know enough to be
dangerous and talk about that right so I
think a lot of folks they don't give
themselves enough credit for the CR
functional things they do in these
larger companies especially in the hrbp
world which I think is like the COO of
this function and they limit themselves
so it's less about the job you have or
have had it's more about what you did as
far as talking about yourself for scale
and your aptitude for scale even if
you've never done it because you might
have done it just in a different way
yeah yeah it's your ability to explain
the narrative and so from my other side
because I agree with you I think hrbp is
an awesome path
I also think head of recruiting is an
amazing path like in recruiting
basically that's the only problem that
you know most companies have you think
about but regardless like it's very
similar to sales in many ways you have
to intimately know the business you have
to intimately know the product you have
to be really good with numbers you have
to be really good with relationships and
so those are the ways that regardless of
where you come up I think there's a
narrative to be had and you know the
other piece is it turns out that you
know nobody's perfect nobody has every
piece of experience and I think a lot of
times candidates tell the story that
like oh it's super competitive out there
like other people have done more things
than me and I would just really
encourage you to focus more on yourself
and to focus more on like how you can
add value to that company because if you
focus more on yourself you're going to
get really tight with your personal
narrative and your personal narrative is
going to dictate whether or not you get
the job yeah and to that point go get
those experience experiences right if
you're a recruiter if you're in comp and
you're not working cross functionally
and you don't understand the culture and
the business and the workforce plan of
that business and you're not thinking
about that to create the things you're
doing go start working like that because
it doesn't matter where you sit it
matters who you work with and the impact
you have and that is is controllable I
always say and Linkedin forget about
your job title LinkedIn like what are
the five bullets underneath that title
that's the job
so true you know okay so let's go back
to this Dear Abby question which by the
way definitely need a new name on this
Kelly but I kind of like it okay so okay
so you get this feedback say she got
rejected yes right yes yes yes now your
advice is not go get another job that
like helps you round out this narrative
your advice is inside of your company
don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about what your title
is about what your current respon
abilities are go solve problems in those
areas view that feedback as an
opportunity for you to grow like
somebody was just really honest with you
and now you know what the external
narrative could be about you and now
it's on you to just go solve problems
inside of your current company that have
to do in that area so then you can earn
the right to then have an answer for
that in the next interview that's
awesome advice Kelly I love correct yes
and we can do it with anything right if
you're in in this situation this dear
Abbey situation if you're an hrbp in
this larger organization and you want to
be a
CPO just go architect doing a mini CPO
role now in that company and explain why
it's a mirror to this other company and
if you don't know how to do that there
are people that can help you do that I
mean that's not a problem so anyway this
is a great segment thanks for the
question keep them coming team have a
good rest of your day peace HR Heretics
