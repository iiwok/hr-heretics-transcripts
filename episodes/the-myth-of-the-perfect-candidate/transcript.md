I'm going to say something
 
I'm going to say something
controversial which is you're talking to
 
controversial which is you're talking to
the wrong
 
the wrong
person and I find that when recruiters
 
person and I find that when recruiters
deliver that sort of feedback there's
 
deliver that sort of feedback there's
always something underneath the surface
 
always something underneath the surface
that you are missing because you're not
 
that you are missing because you're not
actually talking to the person who had
 
actually talking to the person who had
the feedback you're talking to an
 
the feedback you're talking to an
intermediary and so I don't know exactly
 
intermediary and so I don't know exactly
where you're at in this interview
 
where you're at in this interview
process but one of the things that I
 
process but one of the things that I
like to do just in any sort of business
 
like to do just in any sort of business
deal is to remove the intermediary now
 
deal is to remove the intermediary now
it's not like doing it disrespectfully
 
it's not like doing it disrespectfully
it's not like cold shouldering the
 
it's not like cold shouldering the
recruiter but it is like if you got that
 
recruiter but it is like if you got that
piece of feedback and you were rejected
 
piece of feedback and you were rejected
right then what I would do is like I
 
right then what I would do is like I
would actually ping the hiring manager
 
would actually ping the hiring manager
thank them so much for their time and
 
thank them so much for their time and
ask them to jump on a quick call to get
 
ask them to jump on a quick call to get
more specific feedback so then you can
 
more specific feedback so then you can
learn and ask follow-up questions which
 
learn and ask follow-up questions which
is always where the meat is if you're
 
is always where the meat is if you're
still in the process right then great
 
still in the process right then great

let's figure out a way to talk to the
hiring manager and talk about how that
 
hiring manager and talk about how that
feedback how it's showing up for them
 
feedback how it's showing up for them

I've been in these conversations for
 
I've been in these conversations for

show up you show up to the first you
 
show up you show up to the first you
know we're going to open the wreck up
 
know we're going to open the wreck up
we're going to have like our first open
 
we're going to have like our first open
wreck meeting and the hiring manager is
 
wreck meeting and the hiring manager is
like listing like literally like 37
 
like listing like literally like 37
different pieces of criteria that must
 
different pieces of criteria that must
be true totally and you're like okay
 
be true totally and you're like okay
great I just did a LinkedIn search and
 
great I just did a LinkedIn search and
it turns out there's literally zero
 
it turns out there's literally zero
people in the world yeah that has like
 
people in the world yeah that has like
all of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you just asked for
 
all of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you just asked for
yeah and so let's go through that list
 
yeah and so let's go through that list
and let's like take a few things out
 
and let's like take a few things out
because that's not going to fly I
 
because that's not going to fly I
actually think just to have empathy for
 
actually think just to have empathy for
recrui just like given everything that's
 
recrui just like given everything that's
gone on over the last couple of years
 
gone on over the last couple of years
they've been impacted yes at a
 
they've been impacted yes at a
disproportional rate as part of these
 
disproportional rate as part of these
reductions in forces and so you're
 
reductions in forces and so you're
talking about a team that is incredibly
 
talking about a team that is incredibly
lean right now and so often times when
 
lean right now and so often times when
they're dealing with hiring managers
 
they're dealing with hiring managers
they don't have the bandwidth to put
 
they don't have the bandwidth to put
back push back often times when H
 
back push back often times when H
managers are delivering feedback they
 
managers are delivering feedback they
don't have the time to like really dig
 
don't have the time to like really dig
deep to figure out what's actually going
 
deep to figure out what's actually going
on right and so again all respect for
 
on right and so again all respect for
Recruiters in the world but just
 
Recruiters in the world but just
understanding the moment that these
 
understanding the moment that these
folks are in right now I think it's if
 
folks are in right now I think it's if
you especially if you are a director
 
you especially if you are a director
plus candidate you got to get to the
 
plus candidate you got to get to the
hiring manager in order to get the real
 
hiring manager in order to get the real
fee yeah and I agree and I think in my
 
fee yeah and I agree and I think in my
experience and about you but I feel like
 
experience and about you but I feel like
candidates can give more credit to the
 
candidates can give more credit to the
thoughtfulness of these processes and
 
thoughtfulness of these processes and
this criteria than actually H has has
 
this criteria than actually H has has
happened and again no one's fault Etc
 
happened and again no one's fault Etc
but they'll kind of take this feedback
 
but they'll kind of take this feedback
as the word of God and it's like what
 
as the word of God and it's like what
then the hiring manager could change
 
then the hiring manager could change
their mind every other day and it's just
 
their mind every other day and it's just
chaotic and so again my advice on that
 
chaotic and so again my advice on that
is anticipate that like how could this
 
is anticipate that like how could this
person who sent this in actually
 
person who sent this in actually
probably anticipate some of this
 
probably anticipate some of this
feedback or some of these beliefs
 
feedback or some of these beliefs
because this is a quite common one you
 
because this is a quite common one you
know what I mean and get in front of it
 
know what I mean and get in front of it
with the conversation with that hiring
 
with the conversation with that hiring
manager in different ways that's really
 
manager in different ways that's really
good feedback Kelly I I totally agree
 
good feedback Kelly I I totally agree
with you it's like we all know you know
 
with you it's like we all know you know
if if you were to think about your own
 
if if you were to think about your own
resume you all know like what the
 
resume you all know like what the
greatest hits are totally you also know
 
greatest hits are totally you also know
where your gaps are and I think being
 
where your gaps are and I think being
able to speak
 
able to speak
proactively about your gaps and how you
 
proactively about your gaps and how you
Ma how you going to manage those and
 
Ma how you going to manage those and
round those out versus just saying like
 
round those out versus just saying like
this is a gap like without a plan to
 
this is a gap like without a plan to
address it I think that's a really good
 
address it I think that's a really good
strategy that I I don't think I've seen
 
strategy that I I don't think I've seen
deployed very often
 
deployed very often
yeah like when I was kind of midcareer
 
yeah like when I was kind of midcareer

helpful to have that because you might
 
helpful to have that because you might
proactively bring up things that the
 
proactively bring up things that the
hiring manager or the recruiter didn't
 
hiring manager or the recruiter didn't

were very active in working with them if
not co- collaborating on work and
 
not co- collaborating on work and
programs and implementation and all the
 
programs and implementation and all the
things and so you know enough to be
 
things and so you know enough to be
dangerous and talk about that right so I
 
dangerous and talk about that right so I
think a lot of folks they don't give
 
think a lot of folks they don't give
themselves enough credit for the CR
 
themselves enough credit for the CR
functional things they do in these
 
functional things they do in these
larger companies especially in the hrbp
 
larger companies especially in the hrbp
world which I think is like the COO of
 
world which I think is like the COO of
this function and they limit themselves
 
this function and they limit themselves
so it's less about the job you have or
 
so it's less about the job you have or
have had it's more about what you did as
 
have had it's more about what you did as
far as talking about yourself for scale
 
far as talking about yourself for scale
and your aptitude for scale even if
 
and your aptitude for scale even if
you've never done it because you might
 
you've never done it because you might
have done it just in a different way
 
have done it just in a different way
yeah yeah it's your ability to explain
 
yeah yeah it's your ability to explain
the narrative and so from my other side
 
the narrative and so from my other side
because I agree with you I think hrbp is
 
because I agree with you I think hrbp is
an awesome path
 
an awesome path
I also think head of recruiting is an
 
I also think head of recruiting is an
amazing path like in recruiting
 
amazing path like in recruiting
basically that's the only problem that
 
basically that's the only problem that
you know most companies have you think
 
you know most companies have you think
about but regardless like it's very
 
about but regardless like it's very
similar to sales in many ways you have
 
similar to sales in many ways you have
to intimately know the business you have
 
to intimately know the business you have
to intimately know the product you have
 
to intimately know the product you have
to be really good with numbers you have
 
to be really good with numbers you have
to be really good with relationships and
 
to be really good with relationships and
so those are the ways that regardless of
 
so those are the ways that regardless of
where you come up I think there's a
 
where you come up I think there's a
narrative to be had and you know the
 
narrative to be had and you know the
other piece is it turns out that you
 
other piece is it turns out that you
know nobody's perfect nobody has every
 
know nobody's perfect nobody has every
piece of experience and I think a lot of
 
piece of experience and I think a lot of
times candidates tell the story that
 
times candidates tell the story that
