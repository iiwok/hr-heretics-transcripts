that out um and that company actually
 
that out um and that company actually
was able to have a successful exit1

billion dollar uh exit back in
 
billion dollar uh exit back in
 
significant because like as HR you don't
 
significant because like as HR you don't
see yourself as a revenue driver but
 
see yourself as a revenue driver but
when you could see the the the print
 
when you could see the the the print
that you put put on an organization and
 
that you put put on an organization and
see where they got to with you that's it
 
see where they got to with you that's it
right there so I took that same Playbook
 
right there so I took that same Playbook
and put it together at skill
 
and put it together at skill
cycle and created it into a platform
 
cycle and created it into a platform
right but like the biggest thing is that
 
right but like the biggest thing is that
we got to tie performance and engagement
 
we got to tie performance and engagement
to learning and and that's the issue
 
to learning and and that's the issue
it's always monolithic and so I did that
 
it's always monolithic and so I did that
all manually at that company but that
 
all manually at that company but that
took a ridiculous amount of time and
 
took a ridiculous amount of time and
resources does that
 
resources does that
sense that yeah it makes sense I mean
 
sense that yeah it makes sense I mean
the thing I'm wondering right now is
 
the thing I'm wondering right now is
it's 2024
 
it's 2024
uh the market dynamics have completely
 
uh the market dynamics have completely
shifted and what I am hearing is that
 
shifted and what I am hearing is that
the leash on performance is much shorter
 
the leash on performance is much shorter
such that like such that you know why
 
such that like such that you know why
would we invest in skill development
 
would we invest in skill development
when like we have a line out the door
 
when like we have a line out the door
and can just go hire someone else so
 
and can just go hire someone else so
what do you say to a CEO that says
 
what do you say to a CEO that says
that's
 
that's
you you could do that and still continue
 
you you could do that and still continue
to waste money waste time on average
 
to waste money waste time on average
just for a mid-level employee if they
 
just for a mid-level employee if they
whether you push them out the door or
 
whether you push them out the door or
they churn it's at least 110,000 and it
 
they churn it's at least 110,000 and it
continues to go up the higher they they
 
continues to go up the higher they they
go up
 
go up
 
that's how do you prove that like where
 
that's how do you prove that like where
does that number come from it it's a
 
does that number come from it it's a
mid-level employee right and so you're
 
mid-level employee right and so you're
losing at least three months at work
 
losing at least three months at work
because they're not going to be there
 
because they're not going to be there
right so so you add that together then
 
right so so you add that together then
you add the three months of recruiting
 
you add the three months of recruiting
costs because they're out there doing it
 
costs because they're out there doing it
and then you add the three months of
 
and then you add the three months of
managers time because they're out there
 
managers time because they're out there
doing that and then you look at the
 
doing that and then you look at the
three months of goals that are not being
 
three months of goals that are not being
accomplished it adds up pretty quickly
 
accomplished it adds up pretty quickly
and and the higher the salary of the
 
and and the higher the salary of the
individual the higher the number goes up
 
individual the higher the number goes up
that that that sounds conservative to me
 
that that that sounds conservative to me
actually Nolan yeah it is but like do
 
actually Nolan yeah it is but like do
that's a thing I I don't I don't think
 
that's a thing I I don't I don't think
actually people calculate this well this
 
actually people calculate this well this
is what I think the problem is is
 
is what I think the problem is is
everyone experiences this and feels it
 
everyone experiences this and feels it
but nobody puts together the right
 
but nobody puts together the right
business case and and it doesn't change
 
business case and and it doesn't change
Behavior unless you put together a solid
 
Behavior unless you put together a solid
business case
 
business case
so that's why I was really curious about
 
so that's why I was really curious about
where you pulled that number from
 
where you pulled that number from
because I think our audience needs to
 
because I think our audience needs to
put together this model and to your
 
put together this model and to your
point chrisy go to the CFO because like
 
point chrisy go to the CFO because like
the CFO is the person who is going to
 
the CFO is the person who is going to
align with you to get this done and to
 
align with you to get this done and to
actually change business Behavior versus
 
actually change business Behavior versus
like the revolving door it is expensive
 
like the revolving door it is expensive
not just in money but in time yeah and
 
not just in money but in time yeah and

that's the thing I think people don't
really is money time is money and so
 
really is money time is money and so

we have the same issue at pendo right
our our product we we help like it and
 
our our product we we help like it and
it's it's amazing how how how many
 
it's it's amazing how how how many
people don't know either know how to or
 
people don't know either know how to or
don't want to dig into quantifying
 
don't want to dig into quantifying

I still think it's really hard to
 
I still think it's really hard to
quantify at some companies like if I go
 
quantify at some companies like if I go
back to my time at door Dash you know it
 
back to my time at door Dash you know it
it we're growing so fast you're
 
it we're growing so fast you're
literally putting the plane together
 
literally putting the plane together
while you're at 50,000 ft and so a lot
 
while you're at 50,000 ft and so a lot
of these things like the metrics are not
 
of these things like the metrics are not
available and you're kind of guessing
 
available and you're kind of guessing
right and you know as as because I've
 
right and you know as as because I've
always had this perspective that you
 
always had this perspective that you
know if you have somebody in the
 
know if you have somebody in the
business that's performing well you
 
business that's performing well you
should invest in them because they have
 
should invest in them because they have
the context and relationships we already
 
the context and relationships we already
have the data on them that they're going
 
have the data on them that they're going
to perform well like it's obvious right
 
to perform well like it's obvious right
but it just doesn't happen at
 
but it just doesn't happen at
hypergrowth companies
 
hypergrowth companies
there's um and Jon horo says you should
 
there's um and Jon horo says you should
hire for the next 12 to 18 months and
 
hire for the next 12 to 18 months and
and I think that's actually a prevailing
 
and I think that's actually a prevailing
wisdom uh amongst Tech CEOs is that like
 
wisdom uh amongst Tech CEOs is that like
well like you know they're not growing
 
well like you know they're not growing
with the company so we just hire above
 
with the company so we just hire above

build an army and just completely
 
build an army and just completely
destroys the culture and slows
 
destroys the culture and slows
everything down but you can't figure
 
everything down but you can't figure
that out until after fact and so that's
 
that out until after fact and so that's
the thing I'm thinking about just with
 
the thing I'm thinking about just with
my lived experience is it is a lot
 
my lived experience is it is a lot
harder I think to actually prove the
 
harder I think to actually prove the
business case when you're in the
 
business case when you're in the
trenches at a Growth Company well I mean
 
trenches at a Growth Company well I mean
it becomes automatic like that's the
 
it becomes automatic like that's the
enabling part of it it takes a guest
 
enabling part of it it takes a guest
workout right it's just like because
 
workout right it's just like because
like you know we went with the
 
like you know we went with the
philosophy like you know like let's pick
 
philosophy like you know like let's pick
on nine boxes the these amount of people
 
on nine boxes the these amount of people
are going to only get us through but
 
are going to only get us through but
that that's only like you know one egg
 
that that's only like you know one egg
out of the whole basket right and if
 
out of the whole basket right and if
you're going to be leaning out a few
 
you're going to be leaning out a few
eggs your basket's going to break and so
 
eggs your basket's going to break and so
it's really about enabling the entire
 
it's really about enabling the entire
Workforce and so that becomes automatic
 
Workforce and so that becomes automatic
they get feedback it becomes actionable
 
they get feedback it becomes actionable
they're able to deliver get those skills
 
they're able to deliver get those skills
as long as they have a growth mindset
 
as long as they have a growth mindset
not everybody's going to have a growth
 
not everybody's going to have a growth
mindset be it's like screw this feedback
 
mindset be it's like screw this feedback
I'm out those are the people that chop
 
I'm out those are the people that chop
right and and even if it takes people
 
right and and even if it takes people
longer to learn something to get to a
 
longer to learn something to get to a
goal it's still quicker to get to that
 
goal it's still quicker to get to that
goal than having to recycle and replace
 
goal than having to recycle and replace
and and that's where the metrics become
 
and and that's where the metrics become
very very clear we have it in an
 
very very clear we have it in an
ecosystem in a workflow instead of all
 
ecosystem in a workflow instead of all
these like monolithic processes that we
 
these like monolithic processes that we
just do for shits and giggles right it's
 
just do for shits and giggles right it's
about taking the processes of bringing
 
about taking the processes of bringing
them alive that's interesting I do think
 
them alive that's interesting I do think
it depends though I mean I have a
 
it depends though I mean I have a
slightly different take than the Nolan
 
slightly different take than the Nolan
per usual like I think it I think it

out right because like and often biases
 
out right because like and often biases
with fixed mindsets you know the way
 
with fixed mindsets you know the way
that I looked at it when I had my

midlife crisis is how do you educate the
 
midlife crisis is how do you educate the

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out it's it's really about that
because like we had this thing where
 
because like we had this thing where
social media took over everything but
 
social media took over everything but
inference and critical thinking went out
 
inference and critical thinking went out
the door too right and so it's really

you're speaking of Nolan was really
 
you're speaking of Nolan was really
working then why are we in this climate
 
working then why are we in this climate
right now right you know I mean we're
 
right now right you know I mean we're
like last year sucked um you know I mean
 
like last year sucked um you know I mean
for a lot of organizations um you know
 
for a lot of organizations um you know
we're actually getting back to the
 
we're actually getting back to the
climate that like I grew up in two
 
climate that like I grew up in two
recessions like you know what I mean and
 
recessions like you know what I mean and
and you need to hold on to your people
 
and you need to hold on to your people
even more than that so if if those
 
even more than that so if if those
things are working then why are we in
 
things are working then why are we in
the climate that we are right now you
 
the climate that we are right now you
can only blame politics for to a certain
 
can only blame politics for to a certain
extent like this comes to the
 
extent like this comes to the
macroeconomic things of the capitalist
 
macroeconomic things of the capitalist
society that we live in so it's not
 
society that we live in so it's not
working it's why burnout is happening
 
working it's why burnout is happening
it's why you know people don't have the
 
it's why you know people don't have the
skills that they need to do we just
 
skills that they need to do we just
can't keep on passing the bck and so you
 
can't keep on passing the bck and so you
know with a lot of the industries that
 
know with a lot of the industries that
we're we're working with we quite honest
 
we're we're working with we quite honest
like they've tried it all and it didn't
 
like they've tried it all and it didn't
work and now that this is where they're
 
work and now that this is where they're
going to and it's becoming a safety net
 
going to and it's becoming a safety net
for them I think you're right with with
 
for them I think you're right with with
later stage companies I I pulled the
 
later stage companies I I pulled the
numbers this morning since the beginning
 
numbers this morning since the beginning
of 2022
 
of 2022
 
and so I I think you're exactly right
 
and so I I think you're exactly right
with later stage companies post IPO
 
with later stage companies post IPO
companies companies that have been
 
companies companies that have been
around for a while that have seen this
 
around for a while that have seen this
sort of thing before and know it's
 
sort of thing before and know it's
obvious to invest in your current staff
 
obvious to invest in your current staff
for whatever reason I don't think
 
for whatever reason I don't think
pre-ipo Tech has gotten the message and
 
pre-ipo Tech has gotten the message and
that's there are the companies who work
 
that's there are the companies who work
with and that's the majority of
 
with and that's the majority of
companies that they work with because
 
companies that they work with because
they can't afford to make a Bad Bet
 
they can't afford to make a Bad Bet
that that I I agree with that but I you
 
that that I I agree with that but I you
know my I have not I I would love to
 
know my I have not I I would love to
know the CEOs you're talking to because
 
know the CEOs you're talking to because
the CEOs I talk to just get so drunk on
 
the CEOs I talk to just get so drunk on
recruiting yeah and just love to recruit
 
recruiting yeah and just love to recruit
it's like the thing that they want to do
 
it's like the thing that they want to do
and look just to go back to what you
 
and look just to go back to what you
said a lot of these companies are very
 
said a lot of these companies are very
real a lot of them are growing
 
real a lot of them are growing
valuations are down because interest
 
valuations are down because interest
rates are higher and I think that is
 
rates are higher and I think that is
just a macro thing the other thing is
 
just a macro thing the other thing is
that you know we did overh for the last
 
that you know we did overh for the last
five years and that's coming down which
 
five years and that's coming down which
is giving people the perception that
 
is giving people the perception that
more great talent is available on the
 
more great talent is available on the
market I actually think that that is
 
market I actually think that that is
true the thing that I'm seeing right now
 
true the thing that I'm seeing right now
is L &amp;d budgets are getting hammered
 
is L &amp;d budgets are getting hammered
like we're cutting L&amp;D staff we're
 
like we're cutting L&amp;D staff we're
cutting L&amp;D tools and so how do you
 
cutting L&amp;D tools and so how do you
convince somebody who is making those
 
convince somebody who is making those
cuts that this is the right thing given
 
cuts that this is the right thing given
that moment right well first off we're
 
that moment right well first off we're
not L &amp; D right you know I mean L&amp;D is
 
not L &amp; D right you know I mean L&amp;D is
the output of performance and and we're
 
the output of performance and and we're
tied to Performance that creates you
 
tied to Performance that creates you
know L &amp;d initiatives right so you know
 
know L &amp;d initiatives right so you know
we're like we have goals we have
 
we're like we have goals we have
performance engagement and that all ties
 
performance engagement and that all ties
to learning so it becomes that ecosystem
 
to learning so it becomes that ecosystem
we are just not some side thing which
 
we are just not some side thing which
always happens with l &amp;d oh we have a
 
always happens with l &amp;d oh we have a
problem let's throw some training you
 
problem let's throw some training you
know dollars at it you know exactly what
 
know dollars at it you know exactly what
happens yes so like I said a majority of
 
happens yes so like I said a majority of
the companies that we work with within
 
the companies that we work with within
like you know our ideal C customer
 
like you know our ideal C customer
profile um are starting off at 50
 
profile um are starting off at 50
employees going up to, 1500 and because
 
employees going up to, 1500 and because
they're seeing a lot of growth they're
 
they're seeing a lot of growth they're
going through a lot of pains but they
 
going through a lot of pains but they
don't have the the Deep Pockets of a lot
 
don't have the the Deep Pockets of a lot
of these Enterprise companies they have
 
of these Enterprise companies they have
to conserve their dollars and to be
 
to conserve their dollars and to be
quite candid they have to conserve their
 
quite candid they have to conserve their
PE their people and so what we're seeing
 
PE their people and so what we're seeing
especially as we sell into more Coos
 
especially as we sell into more Coos
rather than chro is that this is a very
 
rather than chro is that this is a very
clear productivity tool you know I mean
 
clear productivity tool you know I mean
that they could see the results of the
 
that they could see the results of the
RS of the engagement of the performance
 
RS of the engagement of the performance
and then how it ties the learning and to
 
and then how it ties the learning and to
be able to continue to amplify and
 
be able to continue to amplify and
optimize where they need to be able to
 
optimize where they need to be able to
do better and to be able to get those
 
do better and to be able to get those
results that's very clear it's not an
 
results that's very clear it's not an
assumption anymore it's right there in
 
assumption anymore it's right there in
the face and so when it goes back to
 
the face and so when it goes back to
decision like we'll just say Bob uh do
 
decision like we'll just say Bob uh do
we keep Bob or do we let go Bob and it's
 
we keep Bob or do we let go Bob and it's
just like nope like it's very obvious
 
just like nope like it's very obvious
that we should be keeping Bob um you
 
that we should be keeping Bob um you
know I mean then you know letting him go
 
know I mean then you know letting him go
and so they it it's a safer bet for them
 
and so they it it's a safer bet for them
than to take the risk of
 
than to take the risk of
firing rehiring yeah money money money
 
firing rehiring yeah money money money
loss of growth loss of productivity and
 
loss of growth loss of productivity and
then let's say to say it doesn't work
 
then let's say to say it doesn't work
and and you lose all that Knowledge from
 
and and you lose all that Knowledge from
the the past individual and then there's
 
the the past individual and then there's
culture Dynamics and so they're seeing
 
culture Dynamics and so they're seeing
this like I I want it like we are an HR
 
this like I I want it like we are an HR
tech company like you know we've tried
 
tech company like you know we've tried
to create you know uh basically a new
 
to create you know uh basically a new
thing out there um that has been a
 
thing out there um that has been a
little bit harder to do but at the end
 
little bit harder to do but at the end
of the day we're a productivity tool and
 
of the day we're a productivity tool and
you can see what's going on and how to
 
you can see what's going on and how to
either how your employees are enabling
 
either how your employees are enabling
and getting to where they need to be or
 
and getting to where they need to be or
not enabling christe you said some sorry
 
not enabling christe you said some sorry
you said something um the the jog
 
you said something um the the jog
something for me and there's a
 
something for me and there's a
hypothesis that I have and I'm seeing it

out there where the sale is not to the
 
out there where the sale is not to the
head of HR anymore especially right now
 
head of HR anymore especially right now

and I am and it's a shame but it's real
and I'd love just to get your take on
 
and I'd love just to get your take on
that my take is threefold and one is
 
that my take is threefold and one is
going to totally date me um the I listen
 
going to totally date me um the I listen
you know now that I'm not selling in you
 
you know now that I'm not selling in you
know we have a larger company I I still
 
know we have a larger company I I still
listen to all the sales go because I was
 
listen to all the sales go because I was
a first seller when I started you know
 
a first seller when I started you know
skill cycle years ago and what I've seen
 
skill cycle years ago and what I've seen
is that the HR even with the c or V in
 
is that the HR even with the c or V in
front of their name people are very
 
front of their name people are very
green because they grew up in the Heyday
 
green because they grew up in the Heyday
of the last 10 years where money was
 
of the last 10 years where money was
just flying and all they did was just
 
just flying and all they did was just
Tire right so they're they're they're
 
Tire right so they're they're they're
basically Incognito recruits now now
 
basically Incognito recruits now now
things have become real where where
 
things have become real where where
money doesn't grow on trees and they
 
money doesn't grow on trees and they
don't and they don't have that overall
 
don't and they don't have that overall
business Acumen and and knowledge as to
 
business Acumen and and knowledge as to
what they should do and why that that
 
what they should do and why that that
they're very task oriented instead of
 
they're very task oriented instead of
being strategically oriented so I see a
 
being strategically oriented so I see a
huge skills Gap with within HR and like
 
huge skills Gap with within HR and like
and that's part of the things that we're
 
and that's part of the things that we're
making sure that happens with skill
 
making sure that happens with skill
cycle and any company that comes on
 
cycle and any company that comes on
we're insuring that the HR person is
 
we're insuring that the HR person is
also part of that process even if
 
also part of that process even if
they're not the buyer that they're
 
they're not the buyer that they're
getting the development that they need
 
getting the development that they need
the second reason is is that when you go
 
the second reason is is that when you go
back to and I'll never forget like
 
back to and I'll never forget like
during Co I was talking you know when I
 
during Co I was talking you know when I
was still in my selling days uh back in
 
was still in my selling days uh back in
 
like know went from driving good HR
 
like know went from driving good HR

plexiglass to make sure that you know
was high
 
was high
enough for people during Co to return to
 
enough for people during Co to return to
work right so like you you got to see
 
work right so like you you got to see
the amount of stuff that was thrown at
 
the amount of stuff that was thrown at
HR between 20 and
 
HR between 20 and
 
one siiz fits all put all your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here
 
one siiz fits all put all your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here
function and I I thought that was a
 
function and I I thought that was a
metaphor for a second and me too it
 
metaphor for a second and me too it
definitely was not no I I I was talking
 
definitely was not no I I I was talking
like I worked with her we were peers
 
like I worked with her we were peers
back in the day I mean she's making 500k
 
back in the day I mean she's making 500k
at least she was measuring plexiglass
 
at least she was measuring plexiglass
yeah I mean I thought it was a Brant
 
yeah I mean I thought it was a Brant
metaphor I'm like are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
metaphor I'm like are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
kidding excuse me I don't know if I can
 
kidding excuse me I don't know if I can
say that I'm like are you kidding
 
say that I'm like are you kidding
me so HR became this Jumbotron of put
 
me so HR became this Jumbotron of put

growing up in a generation where like
 
growing up in a generation where like
they were all living during the Heyday
 
they were all living during the Heyday
