protesters so here's the story about
what happened about 30 people occupied
the office of Thomas curian who's the
CEO of Google Cloud in protest over a
contract that they have with Israel they
were in his office for like nine hours
they wouldn't leave they had to be
forcefully removed from the office uh
Google ended up firing 30 of those
people who were in the office and then
about 20 more folks who were involved
later what I think is really interesting
is the note that the head of security
ended up sending out after this uh which
a couple lines from it says we are a
place of business and every goog is
expected to read our policies and apply
them and how they conduct themselves and
communicate in our
workplace um it says the company takes
this extremely seriously and we will
continue to apply our long-standing
policies to take action against
disruptive behavior up to an including
termination what's your take on this one
Kelly this has been you know this has
been erupting all over as well
universities and whatnot I may have been
watching it pretty closely I think the
Google piece is interesting um my
personal take to be honest with you is I
would never
barricade an executive's office in
protests of like I I just maybe it's how
I was raised maybe it's my generation I
think there is
something unique
about thinking that that is a productive
way to do things now
I love protesting I've done it many
times I did it in the Bay Area when
Proposition 8 was on the ballot Etc I'm
I'm full appreciation of protesting what
I want to delineate with you on this
segment is there's a difference in the
how of that protesting and doing it in a
place of work that is distracting and or
disruptive hopefully not violent however
we should get into it because I think
doing doing that in a place of work like
that I think is a different level yeah
my take on this is peaceful protest is a
Bedrock of our democracy and it is
important that we maintain peaceful
protest as a right for every American to
take part
in the line it crosses is for me is uh
your employer and peaceful protesting at
work is not a bedrock of our democracy
like you can go protest on your own time
and those rights should be upheld and
you should be able to do those things
but the moment that you bring it into
the workplace and that you disrupt work
I think is the moment that absolutely
those people are going to get terminated
and what I think has surprised me around
how the protesters have
responded is you know if it was me and I
was doing that I would have expected to
get fired and I would have used that
that marom to then say look like they
fired me that's how much I believe in
this cause like that's why this is super
important to me and in fact they've
actually taken the opposite approach
they have filed a lawsuit with the
National Labor Relations Board for
wrongful
termination and yes for me this is Peak
entitlement in Tech you're going to go
occupy your CEO's office for 9 hours and
expect to maintain
employment that is I don't know what
world we're living in but that's a joke
yeah yeah the nlrb by the way I haven't
said that acronym since grad school like
 
a few layers here Nolan like one is just
a reasonable human how can a reasonable
human choose to barricade an executive's
office and think that that's nothing
more than bringing your whole self to
work I I just don't I don't buy it I
really don't the second is I think is
interesting is the employment contract
so if I'm if I'm just again bringing in
the the lawyer and me which is basically
nothing or nil the employment contract
you're getting paid to do a job so at
the very foundation and I'm just people
might disagree in black and white you
are paid to do a job you know and in the
past tough elections um hard like world
events situ ations we have said as as
many of my companies I've been head of
people at go take a day off go do what
you need to do take time do nothing go
protest like that is very important I do
think that is a stle of our democracy
and it's very important that is much
different than than what is happening
here on campus at a workplace and we've
talked about keeping these things
separate you know as much as we can or
providing rightful space to do this but
I just I mean I I love to talk to this
person who said they say Google is a
place where you can bring your whole
self to work and that's not true anymore
that that is insane to me that again the
entitlement and thinking that that is
within the consideration set of bringing
your whole self to work and I think
Google is kicking back we talked about
it Google's not the like nice fluffy
Leni and parent anymore and they said
Google leadership is Shifting the pend
little bit here I think this is a Belle
weather for Tech I mean you know whether
we like it or not Google does lead the
way with how every tech company manages
their
employees and you know at first it was
like free lunches and then it was like
you know nap pods and everyone's like
copying what Google has done for the
last 20 years and I think a lot of
people on Google now as like this
really soft place to work and i' I've
done that myself for me this it appears
that they have actually drawn a red line
and said we've had enough we are not
going to accept this Behavior anymore we
are going to draw a line and say if you
disrupt work if you disrupt your
colleagues we are going to terminate
you and I think like you know for me and
you as we talk about this stuff and we
think about how it applies to our
companies that's not surprising I think
it's very surprising to people who have
thought of as Google as this safe
to bring your politics into the
workplace and to express those politics
however you want to and I What I Hear
What I Hear From Sundar is the CEO of
Google Now is no that is not this
workplace anymore and we are not going
to accept this Behavior anymore hey

and a Nolan and Kelly from hrh heretic
sent
 
you right right I think this is an
escalated version of what we've talked
about many months ago right and and
separating work and politics and you
know to the point where it might become
a distraction or uncomfortable or Etc
and this is like the physical version of
what we talked about before which is
slacks and you know tweets and all of
these these things and I think yeah I
think it's it does represent a change
though Nolan because it does say right
years ago Google's response in the past
was to literally have like Kumbaya sitd
Downs with employees that would would do
this almost like you'd see on an episode
right at h in Silicon Valley like things
like that they would do this and they're
shifting that and I think I can't help
but think this is connected to a broader
shift that we've been talking about
about about tolerance company's views on
this wanting to keep things separate
when they reach a certain line or point
and I think that line has has shifted in
a lot of companies it absolutely has and
I think part of the reason why is
because it's distracting you know I've
said it a number of times I you know
obviously we've had LJ from coinbase on
we've talked to him about
it me personally like I want to go to
work and I want to solve business
problems like and I think I think that's
increasingly more so for more people as
We've ran the experiment to bring
politics in the
workplace and I think what we're I think
what we're finding is is that that
experiment which was run for a solid 10
years is not productive to building
business it's it's not helpful now right
right now you know me I tend to kind of
look at all the angles maybe be a little
bit softer than you on some things like
if I was in that that Google leadership
team would I have said listen is May
maybe before this happened right because
the the Gaza and the Israel pales I mean
this has been going on for a while it's
been heating up we've been feeling it
even the past few weeks specifically and
would I have said look should we think
about creating space on campus yes for
an organized peaceful protest that's
managed Etc could we think about that
right and that is bringing it into work
but it's different than right this this
wild barricading in offices I I would
have brought that up could that be an
option to meet in the middle especially
to let off some steam and allow this
expression on either side that's
something that I think could have been
discussed very different than what I've
read about what happened I so my my
issue with that is especially with this
conflict is that if you create the space
to do it on one side then you have to
create the space to do it on the other
side and I think you're creating
literally Waring factions inside of your
company and what I what as I've talked
to friends about this um what I think is
is really interesting is as you actually
have conversations with people outside
of work and in your personal life um
look it's a heated topic for sure but
just like in politics in our country I
think people are a lot closer together
on Solutions uh than what you would read
in the media or what you would see on
TV and so I I actually really worry
about doing stuff like that because I
feel like you you bring more division
into it and I think you create like uh
well you did it for them now you have to
do it for us or you picked a side sort
of a thing and I I'll just default back
that like I think what we have learned
is that politics in the workplace is
just distracting and it creates more
problems and that's why Google has now
earned the right to solve this problem
is because they've allowed it for so
long yeah I get it I I get I totally get
and empathize the Hardline we're done
decision to avoid any of that I get it
I'm just I continue to think about and
present the question are there ways to
create spaces um to to to express in
peaceful ways uh versus 100% keep out
but I understand why and it's cleaner
and it's easier I just we just talked
about this in another segment that you
try to control everything things
happen things happen anyway right people
are try so it's a really hard thing uh I
just don't know that I'm on the full All
or Nothing Spectrum I think you're
getting closer though you I'm getting
close it I'm just saying though any if
employees think that behavior is okay
and to your point like nothing's gonna
happen when I do this because I'm bring
my whole self to work I think that is
completely insane it's entitled it is it
is the definition of entitlement which
is I'm going to disrupt work and expect
that you know I still have my job yeah
like it's and so I I do think we're
seeing a really big change happening in
Silicon Valley with the employer
Employment contract and what do
employees expect from employers is not
the same thing that they've expected for
the last 10 years and I think moving
forward it's going to be much more brass
taxs of we expect you to do this job and
we expect you to do it with really high
performance and we expect you to not
cause distractions in the workplace and
yeah I see the leash leash shortening
for sure so that's what's happening so
let us know what your take is uh let us
know what your thoughts on this is and
we're excited to keep the conversation
going
yeah thanks
