# Exit Interviews Are a Waste of Time

## Transcript

 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics. So,
Kelly and I uh just finished a uh hate
segment on engagement surveys and as
part of that
&gt;&gt; that's that's a strong word.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Intentional. So, as part of that
segment, Kelly said something in passing
which was like, "Oh, I hate engagement
surveys. Uh, like I hate exit
interviews." And I was like, "What?"
&gt;&gt; Uh, so, Kelly, explain yourself, girl.
You don't like exit interviews?
&gt;&gt; I want folks that disagree with me here.
Um, I know you pro you will. Uh I have I
have had experiences my whole career and
maybe it was the way I was trained where
exit interviews were a necessary
performative checkbox
to
hear feedback around you know what folks
experienced etc when they're exiting a
company.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I felt like for the most part,
I'm generalizing, okay, Nolan, I'm
generalizing, for the most part, it was
performative. It was a checkbox and it
wasn't really true for a lot of the same
reasons we talked about with engagement
surveys where folks were afraid to tell
the truth.
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, so why would they be afraid in an
exit interview to tell the truth?
Because my experience has been literally
the opposite. Okay. So, the experiences
I've had is that they are going to get
black ballalled. They're not going to be
rechecked for hire. There's some like
hidden folder notes on this person where
they're going to be backneled and
they're not going to get the next job
because they're talking bad about this
person or their former boss or job.
There's a whole there's a whole
conspiracy on it around this and it's
probably true in some cases, right? Like
I'm sure some people have been burned by
this and I and I'm usually, you know,
that HR person where it's like tell me
anything. I'm not going to like I'm the
vault. And they're like, I'm not going
to tell you what I think. I'll tell
other people.
&gt;&gt; So that's been my experience, Nolan.
Maybe it was a corporate kind of
upbringing kind of thing, but it just
seemed very
again checkbox corporate and people just
saw it as something to just get through.
And that's where I always told founders
and CEOs. I'm like, you know, the real
exit interview is again those
conversations that those people have
with their peer, their manager, maybe
their people partner if they trust them.
like the conversations you're having
with that person maybe weeks, months,
who knows? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Up until they resign, that's the real
reason. And th those are the things that
you can
&gt;&gt; take action on and shift in an
organization.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Versus the complaints that come out or
everything was great. I just think it's
more common than you think people are
like, I'm not saying my exit
interview because I'm scared.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, we're fully aligned on this.
So the way that I've done it
historically is not uh I hear what
you're saying which is basically the way
you've seen it is execs get like a uh
executive summary on exit interview only
and that doesn't make any sense. Like I
the way I've done it in the past is
exactly what you're describing, which is
like this is what was happening last
quarter and then this quarter, you know,
this is what this person was mentioning
to their leader to their HRBP and here's
what they said in the exit interview as
another data point as opposed to kind of
like the only thing.
&gt;&gt; Um, I want to tell you a story though
and I have never told this story
publicly that happened one time in an
exit interview. So, we terminated an
employee and uh for performance reasons.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And someone on my team did the exit
interview and
they came and grabbed me immediately
after and they were like, "Nolan, I need
to tell you about this right away." And
I was like, "Okay, what happened?" And
this person was like, "Well, what the
terminated employee said to the HR
person on my team was, yeah, they're
telling you they're terminating me for
performance reasons.
The actual reason that they're
terminating me is because they only uh
want to be around other people that they
do elicit drugs with."
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; So, we ended up running a gigantic
investigation. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And it was true.
And so we had anyways we had to like go
through this whole thing. So I feel like
that was a situ like why did that person
tell us that one? They were super pissed
and it like you know when you're getting
turned for performance by the way people
like you know you're already having the
negative black ball or what you're never
getting hired back again. So it already
kind of like validates the things that
you're saying. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; which is when you're terminating
somebody for performance reasons, like
they're not coming back anyways. So,
that's probably true. I think the other
thing that was true is that my team had
a ton of trust inside of the
organization of like you could tell us
anything and like there won't be
anything vindictive, but that's I think
that's going away, right? I don't think
that's a real thing to hang your hat on
anymore. It's like ultimately HR does
work for the company. Um, but yeah, we
learned that and we would not have
learned that. I don't even know how it
would have ever come out without that
information.
I mean, that's a that's a great story. I
agree with you. And I bet you can count
on one of your hands how many times
that's happened, right? So, I I do
consider that to be
&gt;&gt; kind of an anomaly. I guess
I just I'm used to people teams that are
actually trusted in the organization.
You can believe that. Um,
and I just feel like if you're learning
for the first time what the hell's going
wrong inside organizations through an
exit interview,
you're just not doing your job.
Do you know what I mean? I guess it's
just a it's a it's a it's a belief I
have that if you're going to drive the
right change in in in the company, the
organization, you're you're in one way
or another, you're diagnosing this,
you're you're getting this feedback. Um
I'm not saying that exit interviews are
terrible. I'm not saying we should not
do them. I'm just saying
&gt;&gt; we shouldn't rely on them for
organizational diagnostics.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I agree with that. It's it's a
it's one data point, right? as as you
know we should be thinking about all
these things as one data point.
&gt;&gt; You know somebody in my LinkedIn post
Kelly was like uh where can employees go
to have like a a neutral
person to discuss right if they can't do
the exit interview they can't do the
engagement survey like where is the
neutral
thing and I my my belief is like I don't
think it exists. I don't I don't think
that exists either. Um
what they will do is informally talk to
peers. I mean, right? I mean, all their
close friends already know why they're
leaving.
&gt;&gt; And again,
you know, I think if you're if you're
partnering closely as a as a trusted
&gt;&gt; peer in the organization, you're getting
that information, right? Like I I'm I'm
I'm telling the CEO things that are kind
of, you know, filtered of course, but
I'm telling
them things that are going on before
this person even resigns usually. Um not
in a way to like, you know, extract or
not keep things confidential, but that's
a big part of it. Now, exit interviews
are still you might get nuggets of
information, Nolan. You might get
something that's helpful. I'm just
saying I believe that more times than
not you're not really getting anything
new or different.
&gt;&gt; Agreed. What's you you bring up another
really interesting kind of like one of
these like throwaway comments which is
like yeah like I I filter that.
&gt;&gt; What do you mean throwaway comment? Uh,
I mean you're saying it you're saying it
as making another point. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But there but there's something really
interesting there which is like
&gt;&gt; we haven't talked at all about the
that's a art part of the job, right?
which is what the best people in this
role are doing is taking these different
data points and sound bites and being
able to then use those to predict the
future for the rest of the executive
team. Yes, that that is a that is very
well said and another reason that I just
don't like exit interviews alone on
their face because
&gt;&gt; exactly
&gt;&gt; they don't tell a systematic
well integrated story from many
different angles. It's one data point
lagging indicator on the way out may or
not be true. Um,
right. You have to take these these
these things all the time and and you
gain trust by telling these folks like,
listen, my job is not to be like, well,
Jane said that and this and that. That
is someone that should be fired, right?
The job is to be a vault and
systematically filter and connect things
and use judgment whether these things
are oneoff or or not. And that that is a
differentiator that AI AI can't do that
yet, ma'am. No, AI can't do it. I'm just
wondering if HR should be.
Uh, it's such a delicate dance because
we've all, anybody who's listening to
the show that has worn an HR leadership
hat knows exactly the conversation that
Kelly and I are having right now. And
deciding what to share and not to share
is a very delicate dance. And the more
the more I'm thinking about it right
now, the more I'm like, you know,
I don't know if HR is the best to have
this conversation with as opposed to the
functional business leader.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talent at SignalFire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick." Metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver. Because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions, and talent leaders can
finally take control of the interview
process. Metivview covers all your
compliance needs, works with all your
existing tools, and takes less than 3
minutes to set up. Join talent leaders
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora, and check out
MeteView. Head over to
metaviv.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up running and AI enabled in minutes.
&gt;&gt; But but ideally it's both, Nolan. Like
this is what this is where this is so
interesting because people leaders now
we we talk right panels are all the
time. What's the future people leader?
The future people leader is a business
leader. They they are literally
connecting this stuff with what's going
on in the business and talking about
them together. So, so in my utopian
world, they're interchangeable.
&gt;&gt; So, you're holding a revenue number in
in your utopian world.
&gt;&gt; Well, I have held a revenue number.
&gt;&gt; I agree. That's why I'm using the
example is like I So, I I hear what
you're saying. It's just I don't think
it plays out that way. Right. And I
think this is where
this is this is really where I think
there's a lot of like um like I feel the
stick bending and I think it's going to
snap. And this is why like people are
super pissed is because like well
somebody told Kelly about this but you
know we trust Kelly's judgment. She's
been in the game for 20 years. You know
she's seen all everything.
But the the discretion on that is so
delicate and there's no way you're going
to get it right 100% of the time.
&gt;&gt; The discretion is delicate. There's no
way 100% of the time. But this is where
you have to be really careful who you
hire in these roles because they know
that. Like I know that. I know that I'm
not going to run around and say, "Oh,
and you know, fire this off with one
data point." Like it's a it's an art and
it it takes time and it takes judgment
and
&gt;&gt; you have to be aware of all these
things. But if you're good at it and you
can do it in the right way and you're
using the right level of judgment and
how you think about things and talk
about things and and talk to leaders and
CEOs about it, I do believe that you can
impact the top and bottom line of the
business through these conversations.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I I I agree with you and I've
seen it done well and like I know you do
this well. I think I do it I think I do
it pretty well, too. But it it it's like
I hadn't thought about it from this
angle of like I just don't know. You're
never going to given that we both agree
you're never going to get it right 100%
of the time. Right? If we were to talk
to a founder and invite a founder into
this conversation and explain this to
them, I have a feeling what they would
say is it's like, I'd rather not have
this person in the organization. I'd
rather just have a functional business
leader
solving these problems because
ultimately they're the throat to choke.
&gt;&gt; A lot of them cannot see or solve these
problems on their own.
&gt;&gt; But what does that mean? Like does that
mean that they're not capable of having
difficult conversations or not? They
don't care.
&gt;&gt; Some are not capable. Some don't care.
Some can't see it because they don't
have organ the organizational
capabilities or skill sets to do that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; A lot of leaders have extremely
unhealthy organizations
&gt;&gt; and they're just trottting along and
&gt;&gt; I'm with you. But to me it feels kind of
like a Okay, so we're the babysitter on
this stuff and like holding you know
like it's like the the person underneath
the boat like you know trying to plug
all the holes. It's like isn't that the
captain's job? That's funny. I don't
view it as underneath the boat plugging
the holes, but I do view it as in the
back of the boat moving the rudder if it
needs to be moved.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, man. This is it's this is
philosophically I think this is such an
interesting philosophical discussion.
&gt;&gt; It really is. And ultimately, like throw
the titles out, Nolan. Ultimately, it
comes down to the person,
&gt;&gt; their leadership style, who they are,
their chemistry with the leaders of the
organization. Like ultimately it's not
really a title thing. It's a it's a it's
a person thing. You know what I mean?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What you said in our last segment
what you said in our last segment was
like everything's being rethought from
first principles.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Right. And and this is exactly something
that should be should have
intentionality
about how it's rolled out at companies
because I I right now it's just this is
how we've always done it. Employee has a
complaint, they go to HR, right? Like
that's how it's all and then HR
essentially serves as a filter to what
gets back to the either the business
leader and or CEO and or insert legal
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Totally.
&gt;&gt; I think that's going to be rethought and
be way more intentional in the future.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So just to close this out
irrespective of where you fall on this
and I I loved where the conversation
went. You can see now unpacking my brain
a bit more of this why I just dislike
the robotic
predictive performative nature of exit
interviews. I just think it's completely
incomplete. That's a double
&gt;&gt; complet. I actually like that.
Completely incomplete. I'm going to use
that. Love that. All right. Thanks,
homies. Peace.
