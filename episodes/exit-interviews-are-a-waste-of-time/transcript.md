You don't like exit interviews?
 
You don't like exit interviews?
&gt;&gt; I want folks that disagree with me here.
 
&gt;&gt; I want folks that disagree with me here.
Um, I know you pro you will. Uh I have I
 
Um, I know you pro you will. Uh I have I
have had experiences my whole career and
 
have had experiences my whole career and
maybe it was the way I was trained where
 
maybe it was the way I was trained where
exit interviews were a necessary
 
exit interviews were a necessary
performative checkbox
 
performative checkbox
to
 
to
hear feedback around you know what folks
 
hear feedback around you know what folks
experienced etc when they're exiting a
 
experienced etc when they're exiting a
company.
 
company.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I felt like for the most part,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I felt like for the most part,
I'm generalizing, okay, Nolan, I'm
 
I'm generalizing, okay, Nolan, I'm
generalizing, for the most part, it was
 
generalizing, for the most part, it was
performative. It was a checkbox and it
 
performative. It was a checkbox and it
wasn't really true for a lot of the same
 
wasn't really true for a lot of the same
reasons we talked about with engagement
 
reasons we talked about with engagement
surveys where folks were afraid to tell
 
surveys where folks were afraid to tell
the truth.
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, so why would they be afraid in an
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, so why would they be afraid in an
exit interview to tell the truth?
 
exit interview to tell the truth?
Because my experience has been literally
 
Because my experience has been literally
the opposite. Okay. So, the experiences
 
the opposite. Okay. So, the experiences
I've had is that they are going to get
 
I've had is that they are going to get
black ballalled. They're not going to be
 
black ballalled. They're not going to be
rechecked for hire. There's some like
 
rechecked for hire. There's some like
hidden folder notes on this person where
 
hidden folder notes on this person where
they're going to be backneled and
 
they're going to be backneled and
they're not going to get the next job
 
they're not going to get the next job
because they're talking bad about this
 
because they're talking bad about this
person or their former boss or job.
 
person or their former boss or job.
There's a whole there's a whole
 
There's a whole there's a whole
conspiracy on it around this and it's
 
conspiracy on it around this and it's
probably true in some cases, right? Like
 
probably true in some cases, right? Like
I'm sure some people have been burned by
 
I'm sure some people have been burned by
this and I and I'm usually, you know,
 
this and I and I'm usually, you know,
that HR person where it's like tell me
 
that HR person where it's like tell me
anything. I'm not going to like I'm the
 
anything. I'm not going to like I'm the
vault. And they're like, I'm not going
 
vault. And they're like, I'm not going
to tell you what I think. I'll tell
 
to tell you what I think. I'll tell
other people.
 
other people.
&gt;&gt; So that's been my experience, Nolan.
 
&gt;&gt; So that's been my experience, Nolan.
Maybe it was a corporate kind of
 
Maybe it was a corporate kind of
upbringing kind of thing, but it just
 
upbringing kind of thing, but it just
seemed very
 
seemed very
again checkbox corporate and people just
 
again checkbox corporate and people just
saw it as something to just get through.
 
saw it as something to just get through.
And that's where I always told founders
 
And that's where I always told founders
and CEOs. I'm like, you know, the real
 
and CEOs. I'm like, you know, the real
exit interview is again those
 
exit interview is again those
conversations that those people have
 
conversations that those people have
with their peer, their manager, maybe
 
with their peer, their manager, maybe
their people partner if they trust them.
 
their people partner if they trust them.
like the conversations you're having
 
like the conversations you're having
with that person maybe weeks, months,
 
with that person maybe weeks, months,
who knows? Yeah.
 
who knows? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Up until they resign, that's the real
 
&gt;&gt; Up until they resign, that's the real
reason. And th those are the things that
 
reason. And th those are the things that
you can
 
you can
&gt;&gt; take action on and shift in an
 
&gt;&gt; take action on and shift in an
organization.
 
organization.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Versus the complaints that come out or
 
&gt;&gt; Versus the complaints that come out or
everything was great. I just think it's
 
everything was great. I just think it's
more common than you think people are
 
more common than you think people are
like, I'm not saying my exit
 
like, I'm not saying my exit
interview because I'm scared.
 
interview because I'm scared.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, we're fully aligned on this.
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, we're fully aligned on this.
So the way that I've done it
 
So the way that I've done it
historically is not uh I hear what
 
historically is not uh I hear what
you're saying which is basically the way
 
you're saying which is basically the way
you've seen it is execs get like a uh
 
you've seen it is execs get like a uh
executive summary on exit interview only
 
executive summary on exit interview only
and that doesn't make any sense. Like I
 
and that doesn't make any sense. Like I
the way I've done it in the past is
 
the way I've done it in the past is
exactly what you're describing, which is
 
exactly what you're describing, which is
like this is what was happening last
 
like this is what was happening last
quarter and then this quarter, you know,
 
quarter and then this quarter, you know,
this is what this person was mentioning
 
this is what this person was mentioning
to their leader to their HRBP and here's
 
to their leader to their HRBP and here's
what they said in the exit interview as
 
what they said in the exit interview as
another data point as opposed to kind of
 
another data point as opposed to kind of
like the only thing.
 
like the only thing.
&gt;&gt; Um, I want to tell you a story though
 
&gt;&gt; Um, I want to tell you a story though
and I have never told this story
 
and I have never told this story
publicly that happened one time in an
 
publicly that happened one time in an
exit interview. So, we terminated an
 
exit interview. So, we terminated an
employee and uh for performance reasons.
 
employee and uh for performance reasons.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And someone on my team did the exit
 
&gt;&gt; And someone on my team did the exit
interview and
 
interview and
they came and grabbed me immediately
 
they came and grabbed me immediately
after and they were like, "Nolan, I need
 
after and they were like, "Nolan, I need
to tell you about this right away." And
 
to tell you about this right away." And
I was like, "Okay, what happened?" And
 
I was like, "Okay, what happened?" And
this person was like, "Well, what the
 
this person was like, "Well, what the
terminated employee said to the HR
 
terminated employee said to the HR
person on my team was, yeah, they're
 
person on my team was, yeah, they're
telling you they're terminating me for
 
telling you they're terminating me for
performance reasons.
 
performance reasons.
The actual reason that they're
 
The actual reason that they're
terminating me is because they only uh
 
terminating me is because they only uh
want to be around other people that they
 
want to be around other people that they
do elicit drugs with."
 
do elicit drugs with."
&gt;&gt; Wow.
 
&gt;&gt; Wow.
 
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; So, we ended up running a gigantic
 
&gt;&gt; So, we ended up running a gigantic
investigation. Yeah.
 
investigation. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And it was true.
 
&gt;&gt; And it was true.
And so we had anyways we had to like go
 
And so we had anyways we had to like go
through this whole thing. So I feel like
 
through this whole thing. So I feel like
that was a situ like why did that person
 
that was a situ like why did that person
tell us that one? They were super pissed
 
tell us that one? They were super pissed
and it like you know when you're getting
 
and it like you know when you're getting
turned for performance by the way people
 
turned for performance by the way people
like you know you're already having the
 
like you know you're already having the
negative black ball or what you're never
 
negative black ball or what you're never
getting hired back again. So it already
 
getting hired back again. So it already
kind of like validates the things that
 
kind of like validates the things that
you're saying. Yeah,
 
you're saying. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; which is when you're terminating
 
&gt;&gt; which is when you're terminating
somebody for performance reasons, like
 
somebody for performance reasons, like
they're not coming back anyways. So,
 
they're not coming back anyways. So,
that's probably true. I think the other
 
that's probably true. I think the other
thing that was true is that my team had
 
thing that was true is that my team had
a ton of trust inside of the
 
a ton of trust inside of the
organization of like you could tell us
 
organization of like you could tell us
anything and like there won't be
 
anything and like there won't be
anything vindictive, but that's I think
 
anything vindictive, but that's I think
that's going away, right? I don't think
 
that's going away, right? I don't think
that's a real thing to hang your hat on
 
that's a real thing to hang your hat on
anymore. It's like ultimately HR does
 
anymore. It's like ultimately HR does
work for the company. Um, but yeah, we
 
work for the company. Um, but yeah, we
learned that and we would not have
 
learned that and we would not have
learned that. I don't even know how it
 
learned that. I don't even know how it
would have ever come out without that
 
would have ever come out without that
information.
 
information.
I mean, that's a that's a great story. I
 
I mean, that's a that's a great story. I
agree with you. And I bet you can count
 
agree with you. And I bet you can count
on one of your hands how many times
 
on one of your hands how many times
that's happened, right? So, I I do
 
that's happened, right? So, I I do
consider that to be
 
consider that to be
&gt;&gt; kind of an anomaly. I guess
 
&gt;&gt; kind of an anomaly. I guess
I just I'm used to people teams that are
 
I just I'm used to people teams that are
actually trusted in the organization.
 
actually trusted in the organization.
You can believe that. Um,
 
You can believe that. Um,
and I just feel like if you're learning
 
and I just feel like if you're learning
for the first time what the hell's going
 
for the first time what the hell's going
wrong inside organizations through an
 
wrong inside organizations through an
exit interview,
 
exit interview,
you're just not doing your job.
 
you're just not doing your job.
Do you know what I mean? I guess it's
 
Do you know what I mean? I guess it's
just a it's a it's a it's a belief I
 
just a it's a it's a it's a belief I
have that if you're going to drive the
 
have that if you're going to drive the
right change in in in the company, the
 
right change in in in the company, the
organization, you're you're in one way
 
organization, you're you're in one way
or another, you're diagnosing this,
 
or another, you're diagnosing this,
you're you're getting this feedback. Um
 
you're you're getting this feedback. Um
I'm not saying that exit interviews are
 
I'm not saying that exit interviews are
terrible. I'm not saying we should not
 
terrible. I'm not saying we should not
do them. I'm just saying
 
do them. I'm just saying
&gt;&gt; we shouldn't rely on them for
 
&gt;&gt; we shouldn't rely on them for
organizational diagnostics.
 
organizational diagnostics.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I agree with that. It's it's a
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I agree with that. It's it's a
it's one data point, right? as as you
 
it's one data point, right? as as you
know we should be thinking about all
 
know we should be thinking about all
these things as one data point.
 
these things as one data point.
&gt;&gt; You know somebody in my LinkedIn post
 
&gt;&gt; You know somebody in my LinkedIn post
Kelly was like uh where can employees go
 
Kelly was like uh where can employees go
to have like a a neutral
 
to have like a a neutral
person to discuss right if they can't do
 
person to discuss right if they can't do
the exit interview they can't do the
 
the exit interview they can't do the
engagement survey like where is the
 
engagement survey like where is the
neutral
 
neutral
thing and I my my belief is like I don't
 
thing and I my my belief is like I don't
think it exists. I don't I don't think
 
think it exists. I don't I don't think
that exists either. Um
 
that exists either. Um
what they will do is informally talk to
 
what they will do is informally talk to
peers. I mean, right? I mean, all their
 
peers. I mean, right? I mean, all their
close friends already know why they're
 
close friends already know why they're
leaving.
 
leaving.
&gt;&gt; And again,
 
&gt;&gt; And again,
you know, I think if you're if you're
 
you know, I think if you're if you're
partnering closely as a as a trusted
 
partnering closely as a as a trusted
&gt;&gt; peer in the organization, you're getting
 
&gt;&gt; peer in the organization, you're getting
that information, right? Like I I'm I'm

I'm telling the CEO things that are kind
of, you know, filtered of course, but
 
of, you know, filtered of course, but
I'm telling
 
I'm telling
them things that are going on before
 
them things that are going on before
this person even resigns usually. Um not
 
this person even resigns usually. Um not
in a way to like, you know, extract or
 
in a way to like, you know, extract or
not keep things confidential, but that's
 
not keep things confidential, but that's
a big part of it. Now, exit interviews
 
a big part of it. Now, exit interviews
are still you might get nuggets of
 
are still you might get nuggets of
information, Nolan. You might get
 
information, Nolan. You might get
something that's helpful. I'm just
 
something that's helpful. I'm just
saying I believe that more times than
 
saying I believe that more times than
not you're not really getting anything
 
not you're not really getting anything
new or different.
 
new or different.
&gt;&gt; Agreed. What's you you bring up another
 
&gt;&gt; Agreed. What's you you bring up another
really interesting kind of like one of
 
really interesting kind of like one of
these like throwaway comments which is
 
these like throwaway comments which is
like yeah like I I filter that.
 
like yeah like I I filter that.
&gt;&gt; What do you mean throwaway comment? Uh,

interesting there which is like
 
interesting there which is like
&gt;&gt; we haven't talked at all about the
 
&gt;&gt; we haven't talked at all about the
that's a art part of the job, right?
 
that's a art part of the job, right?
which is what the best people in this
 
which is what the best people in this
role are doing is taking these different
 
role are doing is taking these different
data points and sound bites and being
 
data points and sound bites and being
able to then use those to predict the
