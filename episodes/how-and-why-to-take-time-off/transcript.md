over the years it's definitely been a
 
over the years it's definitely been a
journey you know what I mean and

especially because when I started you
had the acred vacation time you build up
 
had the acred vacation time you build up
the bank you do all these things and
 
the bank you do all these things and
then it gets thrown away so now there's
 
then it gets thrown away so now there's
unlimited time off which ironically
 
unlimited time off which ironically
backfires and it means no one takes

dirty secret is unlimited vacations this
 
dirty secret is unlimited vacations this
like trap where you take away the
 
like trap where you take away the

to help make sure that you acrew to your
 
to help make sure that you acrew to your
new policy like the whole thing is
 
new policy like the whole thing is
confusing so there's a lot of different
 
confusing so there's a lot of different
things over the ears no one right like a
 
things over the ears no one right like a
a rule of thumb and I don't um I don't
 
a rule of thumb and I don't um I don't
agree with putting back in a rules I

think it's there so many headaches hey
 
think it's there so many headaches hey
if you're not taking you know one week
 
if you're not taking you know one week
every quarter on average that's
 
every quarter on average that's
something to look at some people you
 
something to look at some people you
know they take two weeks off and it it's
 
know they take two weeks off and it it's
it's different combinations but a nice
 
it's different combinations but a nice
rule of thumb I like to use is that one
 
rule of thumb I like to use is that one
week per quarter because I have a
 
week per quarter because I have a
problem taking vacation also yeah so
 
problem taking vacation also yeah so

with the best ideas we're living in this
world of AI I've been seeing a bunch of
 
world of AI I've been seeing a bunch of
people post about it and I keep thinking
 
people post about it and I keep thinking
you know the future of AI is like these
 
you know the future of AI is like these
humanoids to where like it's human plus
 
humanoids to where like it's human plus
AI for the human to be really good we
 
AI for the human to be really good we
have to be really good at thinking and
 
have to be really good at thinking and
part of being good at thinking is having
 
part of being good at thinking is having
time with your thoughts away from
 
time with your thoughts away from
screens away from your phone away from
 
screens away from your phone away from
slack and I think of vacation whether
 
slack and I think of vacation whether
you're Kelly and you can do this I love
 
you're Kelly and you can do this I love
Kelly's way of doing it or whether even
 
Kelly's way of doing it or whether even
you're me I kind of do the same thing
 
you're me I kind of do the same thing
with my team it's like look I'm
 
with my team it's like look I'm
unavailable during this time if you need
 
unavailable during this time if you need
me for something urgent you pick up the
 
me for something urgent you pick up the
phone and you call me but like don't me
 
phone and you call me but like don't me
and if you do don't expect me to get
 
and if you do don't expect me to get
back to you until 8:30 and I think just
 
back to you until 8:30 and I think just
expectation setting and doing those
 
expectation setting and doing those
things we we live in
 
things we we live in
this hustle porn culture to where it's
 
this hustle porn culture to where it's
like oh it's so cool to be working 24
 
like oh it's so cool to be working 24
hours a day well it turns out like if I
 
hours a day well it turns out like if I
don't sleep eight hours I'm the
 
don't sleep eight hours I'm the
next day I and I've learned that that's
 
next day I and I've learned that that's
something that didn't happen to me when
 
something that didn't happen to me when
I was 24 but definitely happens to me
 
I was 24 but definitely happens to me
