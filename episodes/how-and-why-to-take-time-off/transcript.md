# How (and why!) to take time off

## Transcript

 
what's up everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics this week it is 4th of July and
so we wanted to do a little bit more of
a fun segment today on how to take
[Applause]
[Music]
 
vacations so Kelly I'm going to be
honest with you I'm not good at this but
what's your take and and how do you
vacation and how have thought about this
over the years it's definitely been a
journey you know what I mean and
especially because when I started you
had the acred vacation time you build up
the bank you do all these things and
then it gets thrown away so now there's
unlimited time off which ironically
backfires and it means no one takes
vacation like it's the true biggest
dirty secret is unlimited vacations this
like trap where you take away the
vacation policy and then we had to like
insert policies to make sure people were
taking vacation so it's this whole thing
bro was talking to Patty McCord once and
she's like wait a minute you took away
vacation but you're you're going to have
a policy because you don't have a policy
to help make sure that you acrew to your
new policy like the whole thing is
confusing so there's a lot of different
things over the ears no one right like a
a rule of thumb and I don't um I don't
agree with putting back in a rules I
think it's there so many headaches hey
if you're not taking you know one week
every quarter on average that's
something to look at some people you
know they take two weeks off and it it's
it's different combinations but a nice
rule of thumb I like to use is that one
week per quarter because I have a
problem taking vacation also yeah so
here I've spent some time thinking about
this and
have made more of an effort as I've aged
so you know I'm in a moment right now to
where I'm building a company I've worked
at two startups that were in hyper
growth mode to where it's like things
are happening all the time I used to
think I still think that
if you're designing your life around
always looking forward to a vacation
that's not really a life worth leading I
think it's it's really important to
design your life as if you're always on
vacation Dirty Heads has this song hey
hey hey I'm on vacation every single day
because I love my occupation I subscribe
to that methodology quite a bit now
having said that did you just sing it
did you just sing that or that's that's
that's the tune feel like you have step
that one you were kind of I'm I'm a big
fan what I will say though is I have
noticed that when I take time off I have
better
ideas and there's something around when
you have empty
space uh especially as knowledge workers
which is the prime the majority of our
audience when you can create that space
for
yourself all of a sudden new ideas and
new connections start forming in your
head and so uh a couple things for me is
like one I don't have the luxury to take
a a week off every quarter but that said
I do try and take a Friday off once a
month to extend it to like a three-day
weekend and then the second piece that
um I saw uh Michael seel post about this
who is uh who's at YC there's basically
two times in Tech where you can really
take a few days off together to where
most of the industry isn't working one
is the week of Fourth of July and the
other is the week between Christmas and
New Year and so during both of those two
weeks I have tried intentionally to take
multiple days off because I know most of
my customers are not going to be working
the expectation is going to be like hey
it usually takes a few days to get back
to people then um and I've tried to
prioritize that not only for me but also
my team yes I think I think I've always
thought about in two ways because I do
agree with you if you're using vacation
to escape a a job or a company or an
occupation you hate it's tough that'll
infiltrate it'll you know seep into your
vacation in my opinion so I think about
it two ways because have gone 1,000
miles per hour for for so many years
very intense very driven it's hard for
me to get away from it right and and I
like it I've loved it so I think about
it as like vacation all the time like
little tiny vacations to your point
sometimes I'll block out 7:00 a.m. to
 
one's touching this I'm going for a long
run in the mountains or somewhere and
that to your point gives me time it
gives me quiet time and also just get
some energy back so shutting everyone
out and and and figuring out how to do
that it also models for other people how
to do that because not everyone's like
mind- numbing 24 hours a day which is
just not good for business the second
thing is the long vacations right you do
have to take time away with your family
and be with them for a week without work
sometimes even if we want to they at
least I'll see for myself they expect
that from me and then having the
awareness there and like I I'll prep
like a week and a half before I go on
vacation and I'll talk to my C team I'll
talk to my HR leadership team I'll talk
to my other people I'm like listen don't
let me do this like please help me I'm
incapable I have to take slack off my
phone like we went to Tahiti two years
ago for like 10 days and that thing was
like I watched it you know the little
app shaking for like 60 seconds I'm like
oh my God I'm going to do it and then I
I had to like text five people to make
me feel safe I'm like I just deleted
this and I got reassurance back they're
like please stop we got it so whatever
you need to do to like cut the cord so
to speak that's what I had to do that's
what I still have to do for the longer
vacations that's such a good tactic and
good strategy so like a couple things I
just want to make sure the audience
heard so the first thing that you do is
you start prepping like a week and a
half two weeks out you're letting your
team know you're letting your C team
know you're letting your direct reports
know and that way it's like hey this is
what's going on I'm going to be you know
in your case deleting slack that's like
that gives me anxiety if I'm going to be
like very candy with you I don't know if
I could could do that yeah um but it's
major anxiety inducing I mean it was
like a joke at the end of like everyone
was joking at the end they're like yeah
we know so they're like helping you go
on vacation towards the end of your prep
it's that that reduces the anxiety and
the pressure yeah and and look you're at
a stage and at a company to where you
can do that and I think that's really
smart I think a lot about false
urgency which in American culture is one
of our big problems it feels like
because we can access people 247 we just
do and the expectation is well you know
we look at our phones for seven hours a
day so they're going to see this thing
very quickly and there's this other
notion that like oh like response time
really matters look I I actually do
believe in quick response times I do
believe when things are urgent people
need to jump on right away but what I
love about what you do is that given
that you are at a company that is post-
product Market fit that is doing very
very well that you have a team that can
support you is you set an expectation
beforehand and you say I'm going to
delete slack you know this is where I'm
going if you need to get a hold of me
for something urgent this is how you do
it yes because those things can happen
and you know to your point being smart
around the type of company you're in if
you're literally a founder and you just
started a company like you like let's be
realistic here but when I think about it
what it really is Nolan it's like this
fall sense of urgency you have to break
your habits and that habit is slack
that's how we live every day and so it
takes like three or four days to be like
okay I'm going to break this habit that
we all have matter totally yeah it's a
it's a decompression so one of the
things I've started to do is is like you
is is to schedule out like time every
single day that's just for me and and in
fact like I do that like first thing
literally every day no days off seven
days a week like usually from about call
it like 6:30 to 8
 
going to work out I'm going into the
mountains or I'm going to the beach and
for me like I'm not looking at slack I'm
not looking at email I'm not looking at
LinkedIn I might have some music in
because like I like to jam when I'm like
working out and doing stuff like that
but I've actually been trying to do less
of that too because we constantly have
some sort of noise and as knowledge
workers like think about the like
knowledge
worker if you're not spending time alone
with your thoughts are you actually
thinking like are you actually coming up
with the best ideas we're living in this
world of AI I've been seeing a bunch of
people post about it and I keep thinking
you know the future of AI is like these
humanoids to where like it's human plus
AI for the human to be really good we
have to be really good at thinking and
part of being good at thinking is having
time with your thoughts away from
screens away from your phone away from
slack and I think of vacation whether
you're Kelly and you can do this I love
Kelly's way of doing it or whether even
you're me I kind of do the same thing
with my team it's like look I'm
unavailable during this time if you need
me for something urgent you pick up the
phone and you call me but like don't me
and if you do don't expect me to get
back to you until 8:30 and I think just
expectation setting and doing those
things we we live in
this hustle porn culture to where it's
like oh it's so cool to be working 24
hours a day well it turns out like if I
don't sleep eight hours I'm the
next day I and I've learned that that's
something that didn't happen to me when
I was 24 but definitely happens to me
now and so I just think all of these
things ultimately end up compounding
and it is upon you like you have to take
this upon yourself to take the time for
you hey everyone we'll be right back in

you'll be UPR running an AI enabled in
minutes and it's okay to be vulnerable
like you know if you ask for help and
You're vulnerable people actually want
to help you usually and it's like I'm
really bad at this and like I really
need this and they're like how can I
help you versus I'm going to set
expectations I'm not going to you don't
have to lead like that you can be like
listen I need this and I'm really bad at
it can you guys help me and they will
and I was talking to someone the other
week and they were on vacation like two
weeks they're like I was getting slacks
I was responding you know we train
people how to treat us even I was told
like in the work week like I'll respond
to slack real
fast then everyone's going to be like
you're going to respond immediately when
that's a
problem urgent events are rare like true
truly ENT events are are typically rare
like usually the the building isn't
burning every single day um and and the
other thing I want to highlight here is
like what Kelly and I are talking about
is agnostic of your role and your
level like if you plan ahead if you
communicate well and you ask your team
for help to be able to do this and you
explain why you need to do it then
everyone's going to lean to that and if
they don't you're working at the wrong
company yeah so yeah quick transition
Kelly what are you doing for the Fourth
of
July well it's my wife's birthday on the
 
every year si birthday yeah it's a good
one you know straight up from Ohio
Hillary from Ohio fourth July it's like

parade west of the Mississippi did not
