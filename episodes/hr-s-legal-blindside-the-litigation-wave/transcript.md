and they claimed retaliation it's a very
common thing I think as as you know I
 
common thing I think as as you know I
think it's very nuanced I think there
 
think it's very nuanced I think there
are a lot of things behind this you know
 
are a lot of things behind this you know
but I do think it's very scary and I
 
but I do think it's very scary and I
think we need to acknowledge for the HR
 
think we need to acknowledge for the HR
world it's also just very frustrating
 
world it's also just very frustrating
and stressful because whether it's
 
and stressful because whether it's
intentional misuse of these terms or
 
intentional misuse of these terms or
inadvertent misuse of these terms what
 
inadvertent misuse of these terms what
ends up happening is a bunch of time
 
ends up happening is a bunch of time
energy resources and money has to get
 
energy resources and money has to get
spent to chase after these things as HR
 
spent to chase after these things as HR
professionals scramble to bring in
 
professionals scramble to bring in
lawyers to support them on you know
 
lawyers to support them on you know
these very serious cases because people
 
these very serious cases because people
are using scary words now you know my
 
are using scary words now you know my
perspective is I think we do have some
 
perspective is I think we do have some
people who are may be coming in and
 
people who are may be coming in and
intentionally abusing these words but I
 
intentionally abusing these words but I
think we also have a lot of people who
 
think we also have a lot of people who
have been misinformed I think that it
 
have been misinformed I think that it
there's a lot of information a lot of
 
there's a lot of information a lot of
misinformation on the internet on Tik
 
misinformation on the internet on Tik
Tok coming from your friends where
 
Tok coming from your friends where
people are being you know really pushed
 
people are being you know really pushed
I would say I would go so far as to say
 
I would say I would go so far as to say
pressured to make sure you stand up for
 
pressured to make sure you stand up for
yourself make sure you never let anyone
 
yourself make sure you never let anyone
pull one over on you and I think it
 
pull one over on you and I think it
comes from this really good place but I
 
comes from this really good place but I
think that sometimes people get misled
 
think that sometimes people get misled
and they end up escalating situations
 
and they end up escalating situations
and turning things into something that
 
and turning things into something that
they're not right difficult feedback is
 
they're not right difficult feedback is
not discrimination in and of itself
 
not discrimination in and of itself
right and so I think that's the
 
right and so I think that's the
conversation we need to be having why is
 
conversation we need to be having why is
this happening how do we manage these
 
this happening how do we manage these
conversations how do we try to get ahead
 
conversations how do we try to get ahead
of them before they happen how do we
 
of them before they happen how do we
deescalate when they happen and and one
 
deescalate when they happen and and one
more in full out you know lawsuit
 
more in full out you know lawsuit
situation what do we do so Kelly I've
 
situation what do we do so Kelly I've
probably seen eight of these uh I have
 
probably seen eight of these uh I have
personally been deposed twice and on the
 
personally been deposed twice and on the
stand once in one of these cases how
 
stand once in one of these cases how
much experience do you have with this
 
much experience do you have with this
Kelly I have a lot I mean I I haven't
 
Kelly I have a lot I mean I I haven't
been in court obviously not obviously
 
been in court obviously not obviously
just I haven't been in court we always
 
just I haven't been in court we always
kind of got to an agreement I have been
 
kind of got to an agreement I have been
in mediation before but I've usually
 
in mediation before but I've usually
always kind of cut these things off of
 
always kind of cut these things off of
the past and got them resolved into
 
the past and got them resolved into
before that which I think is a topic at
 
before that which I think is a topic at
self because I think you know the
 
self because I think you know the
patience level and the tolerance level
 
patience level and the tolerance level
of various leadership teams or Founders
 
of various leadership teams or Founders
chro how you treat these things can you
 
chro how you treat these things can you
know cause escalation or cut it off and
 
know cause escalation or cut it off and
I think the tolerance level has an
 
I think the tolerance level has an
aspect on that meaning go tell them to
 
aspect on that meaning go tell them to
pound sand we did the right thing we're
 
pound sand we did the right thing we're
not giving in I think sometimes that can
 
not giving in I think sometimes that can
lead to going further down the
 
lead to going further down the
litigation line than giving in if that
 
litigation line than giving in if that
makes sense
 
makes sense
so it it does and I think that's
 
so it it does and I think that's
actually the that's the traditional
 
actually the that's the traditional
advice and so that's that's the advice
 
advice and so that's that's the advice
when I got what I got earlier in my
 
when I got what I got earlier in my
career and then I think this trend has
 
career and then I think this trend has
really accelerated over the last call it
 
really accelerated over the last call it
like five to six years and I think some
 
like five to six years and I think some
of the veracity of these claims to
 
of the veracity of these claims to
Melanie's points is coming from this
 
Melanie's points is coming from this
perspective of I need to advocate for
 
perspective of I need to advocate for
myself because it just doesn't feel fair
 
myself because it just doesn't feel fair
and so I think there's a there's
 
and so I think there's a there's
basically three paths a company can take
 
basically three paths a company can take
when presented with an employee
 
when presented with an employee
threatening litigation one is is you try
 
threatening litigation one is is you try
and like mediate and figure out like
 
and like mediate and figure out like
what's going on and try and just like
 
what's going on and try and just like
you know not have the lawyers get
 
you know not have the lawyers get
involved I think that is like the ideal
 
involved I think that is like the ideal
path if that doesn't work I think it
 
path if that doesn't work I think it
comes to a fork in the road and the
 
comes to a fork in the road and the
traditional advice is just like just
 
traditional advice is just like just
settle like you don't want to get
 
settle like you don't want to get
lawyers involved it's a pain in the ass
 
lawyers involved it's a pain in the ass
it's super expensive like just make this
 
it's super expensive like just make this
go away and keep
 
go away and keep
operating and then the contrarian advice
 
operating and then the contrarian advice
is fight it and the reason you want to
 
is fight it and the reason you want to
fight it is because you want to set an
 
fight it is because you want to set an
example that you are not going to be
 
example that you are not going to be
held hostage from any employees making
 
held hostage from any employees making
illegitimate claims and I have played
 
illegitimate claims and I have played
out all three of those paths um
 
out all three of those paths um
obviously path one is what you want to
 
obviously path one is what you want to
try and do first but I am increasingly
 
try and do first but I am increasingly
seeing like more people willing to take
 
seeing like more people willing to take
it all the way to like let's get the
 
it all the way to like let's get the
lawyers involved and I would say 10
 
lawyers involved and I would say 10
years ago the settlement advice almost
 
years ago the settlement advice almost
everybody was taking and increasingly
 
everybody was taking and increasingly
now I'm seeing companies saying like no
 
now I'm seeing companies saying like no
like we are not going to be held hostage
 
like we are not going to be held hostage
we don't believe we did anything wrong
 
we don't believe we did anything wrong
and so like we will go to the mats and
 
and so like we will go to the mats and
fight this and so I'm curious Mel what
 
fight this and so I'm curious Mel what
are you seeing are you seeing the same
 
are you seeing are you seeing the same
Trends
 
Trends
well okay I'm gonna I'm gonna Circle
 
well okay I'm gonna I'm gonna Circle
back to this because I I first have a
 
back to this because I I first have a
question which is I when I hear that I
 
question which is I when I hear that I
feel like what's happening is you are
 
feel like what's happening is you are
targeting a surface level issue the
 
targeting a surface level issue the
surface level issue is that someone's
 
surface level issue is that someone's
suing you and you want to take a stand I
 
suing you and you want to take a stand I
think the deeper issue is you maybe
 
think the deeper issue is you maybe
weren't transparent enough and so
 
weren't transparent enough and so
employees filled in the gaps with their
 
employees filled in the gaps with their
own assumptions you didn't train your
 
own assumptions you didn't train your
managers on how to have empathetic
 
managers on how to have empathetic
conversations so people felt pissed off
 
conversations so people felt pissed off
and they were like I'm gonna take it out
 
and they were like I'm gonna take it out
on you or you know maybe there genuinely
 
on you or you know maybe there genuinely
was a lack of clarity and expectation
 
was a lack of clarity and expectation
setting in the recruitment process you
 
setting in the recruitment process you
brought in employees who thought you
 
brought in employees who thought you
were one type of company you not one
 
were one type of company you not one
type of company and it ended up leading
 
type of company and it ended up leading
to all these issues and
 
to all these issues and
misunderstandings and upset so I I think
 
misunderstandings and upset so I I think
when you tell me when you say this idea
 
when you tell me when you say this idea
that like oh maybe more companies are
 
that like oh maybe more companies are
moving in this direction and that's you
 
moving in this direction and that's you
know you're taking a stand so that you
 
know you're taking a stand so that you
you show that we're not going to take
 
you show that we're not going to take
this I don't know that that addresses
 
this I don't know that that addresses
the underlying issue which is that
 
the underlying issue which is that
there's probably a lot of discontent
 
there's probably a lot of discontent
among your employees and just showing
 
among your employees and just showing
them that you're the head honcho and you
 
them that you're the head honcho and you
won't be you know forced into a decision
 
won't be you know forced into a decision
I don't know that that solves the
 
I don't know that that solves the
problem I I agree I think the way you
 
problem I I agree I think the way you
describe that Nolan is is accurate in
 
describe that Nolan is is accurate in
the sense of you know when I started in
 
the sense of you know when I started in
this profession 20 years ago at the
 
this profession 20 years ago at the
bigger companies it was very hey settle
 
bigger companies it was very hey settle
this that I get it and now earlier stage
 
this that I get it and now earlier stage
kind of more edgy companies that are
 
kind of more edgy companies that are
going from first principles like this is
 
going from first principles like this is
not right we're going to fight this
 
not right we're going to fight this
however I think that's a very to Mel's
 
however I think that's a very to Mel's
Point surface level and almost too
 
Point surface level and almost too
simple of a model like I haven't this is
 
simple of a model like I haven't this is
a very mess thing with a lot of
 
a very mess thing with a lot of
combinations and a lot of context
 
combinations and a lot of context
sometimes people get the combinations
 
sometimes people get the combinations
right and a lot of times they get it
 
right and a lot of times they get it
wrong and the combination I'm talking
 
wrong and the combination I'm talking
about just to keep it simple in my mind
 
about just to keep it simple in my mind
is a 2 by two you know Square 2 by two
 
is a 2 by two you know Square 2 by two
situation the left access you have
 
situation the left access you have
treated well treated poorly and then in
 
treated well treated poorly and then in
the other one you have fair and
 
the other one you have fair and
unfair when you're when it when the when
 
unfair when you're when it when the when
the performance issues and the feedback
 
the performance issues and the feedback
is fair and you're treated well usually
 
is fair and you're treated well usually
those things things end cordially but
 
those things things end cordially but
that's the goal is for things to end
 
that's the goal is for things to end
cordially when I see treated poorly
 
cordially when I see treated poorly
perceived to be treated poorly no matter
 
perceived to be treated poorly no matter
if the feedback is fair or unfair this
 
if the feedback is fair or unfair this
is where this stuff kind of blows up
 
is where this stuff kind of blows up
that's what I've seen and then there are
 
that's what I've seen and then there are
outliers because I had one recently and
 
outliers because I had one recently and
I won't you know obviously go into stuff
 
I won't you know obviously go into stuff
but in the past three years I had a very
 
but in the past three years I had a very
fair issue treated not just well but
 
fair issue treated not just well but
like exceptionally well and they decided
 
like exceptionally well and they decided
to I mean it was just like what so my
 
to I mean it was just like what so my
point is that it's all over the map and
 
point is that it's all over the map and
sometimes they're outliers and sometimes
 
sometimes they're outliers and sometimes
they're not but in my experience no
 
they're not but in my experience no
matter if it's fair or unfair if
 
matter if it's fair or unfair if
someone's perceived to be treated poorly
 
someone's perceived to be treated poorly
lack of transparency or respect or
 
lack of transparency or respect or
whatever it is that's where people get
 
whatever it is that's where people get
angry and they want to get revenge right
 
angry and they want to get revenge right
they seek revenge they want to gut punch
 
they seek revenge they want to gut punch
the company they want to get a lawyer
 
the company they want to get a lawyer
and expect a bunch of money or whatever
 
and expect a bunch of money or whatever
it is I hear you the reality though is
 
it is I hear you the reality though is
all of that is
 
all of that is
subjective I didn't say it wasn't
 
subjective I didn't say it wasn't
totally but I'm just I'm just describing
 
totally but I'm just I'm just describing
to you that like I I think when we get
 
to you that like I I think when we get
actually into this and we get into how
 
actually into this and we get into how
many of these cases that go all the way
 
many of these cases that go all the way
to court who's winning are employees
 
to court who's winning are employees
winning or companies winning and I think
 
winning or companies winning and I think
what you'll find I don't actually know
 
what you'll find I don't actually know
this day to be inter to see this data
 
this day to be inter to see this data
but I think what you'll find is is that
 
but I think what you'll find is is that
for the most part companies are winning
 
for the most part companies are winning
and the reason why is because at
 
and the reason why is because at
employment is at will and to Melanie's
 
employment is at will and to Melanie's
point to to start the show there's this
 
point to to start the show there's this
woman you guys have probably seen this
 
woman you guys have probably seen this
on Instagram and Tik Tok Who does these
 
on Instagram and Tik Tok Who does these
things about like when your flight is
 
things about like when your flight is
delayed like you know don't just like
 
delayed like you know don't just like
accept like the delayed flight thing
 
accept like the delayed flight thing
like go get like a thousand dollar and
 
like go get like a thousand dollar and
and and I think there's this perception
 
and and I think there's this perception
that that applies into
 
that that applies into
employment and in our for for the most
 
employment and in our for for the most
part in the United States it does not
 
part in the United States it does not
employment is at will and so even though
 
employment is at will and so even though
companies may be treating employees not
 
companies may be treating employees not
well or potentially like you know they
 
well or potentially like you know they
feel like
 
feel like
unfairly ultimately in the court of law
 
unfairly ultimately in the court of law
that doesn't matter and so I'm not
 
that doesn't matter and so I'm not
saying like you should do those things
 
saying like you should do those things
but I am saying those things certainly
 
but I am saying those things certainly
happen inside of companies for a whole
 
happen inside of companies for a whole
variety of reasons that that honestly
 
variety of reasons that that honestly
this is the case for HR right fixing
 
this is the case for HR right fixing
those things will save you so much time
 
those things will save you so much time
and money and this is where a people
 
and money and this is where a people
team can just lay the tracks and make
 
team can just lay the tracks and make
things so much easier for you if you're
 
things so much easier for you if you're
running a business but that said
 
running a business but that said
sometimes they still happen even with a
 
sometimes they still happen even with a
great people team because if you have a
 
great people team because if you have a
large organization you just can't
 
large organization you just can't
control all of the things that are going
 
control all of the things that are going
on inside of that
 
on inside of that
organization and as somebody who is who
 
organization and as somebody who is who
is initially on the side of like let's
 
is initially on the side of like let's
just make these things go away I have
 
just make these things go away I have
since been on the side of well I
 
since been on the side of well I
actually think we need to go to the mats
 
actually think we need to go to the mats
on a couple of these things and send an
 
on a couple of these things and send an
example because it's happening too
 
example because it's happening too
frequently and people are thinking that
 
frequently and people are thinking that
they can honestly extort the company for
 
they can honestly extort the company for
additional money when the reality is is
 
additional money when the reality is is
employment is at will yeah I like what
 
employment is at will yeah I like what
you said about the strong foundations
 
you said about the strong foundations
because that does it it it helps control
 
because that does it it it helps control
a lot of the variables that can get out
 
a lot of the variables that can get out
of control and subjective it really can
 
of control and subjective it really can
I have learned people are litigious now
 
I have learned people are litigious now
it's not like everybody is but many
 
it's not like everybody is but many
people actually are litigious I had one
 
people actually are litigious I had one
of the craziest situations ever with a
 
of the craziest situations ever with a
new hire who on literally on day one
 
new hire who on literally on day one
forced our recruiting coordinator to
 
forced our recruiting coordinator to
like sign a paper and he was like I
 
like sign a paper and he was like I
don't know what I'm signing here and it
 
don't know what I'm signing here and it
turned out to be like she was filing a
 
turned out to be like she was filing a
claim with him as a witness that
 
claim with him as a witness that
something happened at her gym he wasn't
 
something happened at her gym he wasn't
there he felt pressured to sign it he
 
there he felt pressured to sign it he
signed it we were like what the hell is
 
signed it we were like what the hell is
going on here she had performance things
 
going on here she had performance things
we decided to terminate she then filed
 
we decided to terminate she then filed
suit against us and so that was one that
 
suit against us and so that was one that
we were like we're taking this one to
 
we were like we're taking this one to
the mats like we don't feel like we've
 
the mats like we don't feel like we've
done anything wrong here there's been
 
done anything wrong here there's been
other cases to where you know folks have
 
other cases to where you know folks have
come after us because they felt like
 
come after us because they felt like
they were induced or other things
 
they were induced or other things
happened during the recruiting process
 
happened during the recruiting process
and you know ultimately like I just
 
and you know ultimately like I just
think there is a subset of people that
 
think there is a subset of people that
are litigious and I think that subset of
 
are litigious and I think that subset of
people is growing I'm going to make a
 
people is growing I'm going to make a
comment that nobody is going to want to
 
comment that nobody is going to want to
hear okay but listen it's what I'm
 
hear okay but listen it's what I'm
thinking
 
thinking

burned and you did everything in your
power to give this person a fair and
 
power to give this person a fair and
Equitable treatment and then it's like a
 
Equitable treatment and then it's like a
slap in the face I want to acknowledge
 
slap in the face I want to acknowledge
that to be honest sometimes it makes you
 
that to be honest sometimes it makes you
start to get cynical and you just don't
 
start to get cynical and you just don't

want to try as hard because I give up
right nothing I can do is ever going to
 
right nothing I can do is ever going to
be enough right and also I want to look

at the other side of this because I have
 
at the other side of this because I have
increasingly over the past few years has
 
increasingly over the past few years has
become really empathetic
 
become really empathetic
to the idea that I think because so many
 
to the idea that I think because so many
people are getting misinformation when
 
people are getting misinformation when
someone genuinely believes that they
 
someone genuinely believes that they
have been wronged they genuinely feel
 
have been wronged they genuinely feel
horrible this is actually emotionally
 
horrible this is actually emotionally

people who are newer to the workforce so
 
people who are newer to the workforce so
if we want to call them the bucket of
 
if we want to call them the bucket of
jenzy we can but I have seen more and

more people where they come and they
 
more people where they come and they
bring a case and they claim this is
 
bring a case and they claim this is
discrimination I've been discriminated

against and it's quite clear to me that
they haven't of course we're going to do
 
they haven't of course we're going to do
all the right steps to investigate and
 
all the right steps to investigate and
make sure is there something we missed

from a fringe issue to I think a lot
more mainstream and I've gotten to the
 
more mainstream and I've gotten to the
point to where like I've actually
 
point to where like I've actually
thought about this and I don't know if
 
thought about this and I don't know if
there is a tool available to this but I
 
there is a tool available to this but I
think it would be an interesting tool to
 
think it would be an interesting tool to
look at which is you know find all of
 
look at which is you know find all of
this is public information once lawsuits
 
this is public information once lawsuits
are filed I would actually be really

saying it's like the right thing to do
I'm saying I have absolutely thought
 
I'm saying I have absolutely thought
about it in the last four to five years
 
about it in the last four to five years
because of how frequently it has
 
because of how frequently it has
happened like it's it's stunning how
 
happened like it's it's stunning how

workplace you come here to get work done
 
workplace you come here to get work done
and we're trying to achieve something
 
and we're trying to achieve something
together as a team for the business but
 
together as a team for the business but
I think the solution isn't to try and
 
I think the solution isn't to try and
find out like who maybe has filed a
 
find out like who maybe has filed a
claim and this and that because you know
 
claim and this and that because you know
you never know maybe it was a legitimate
 
you never know maybe it was a legitimate
claim right I think I think the solution
 
claim right I think I think the solution
is to set really clear expectations in
 
is to set really clear expectations in
the recruitment process about what kind
 
the recruitment process about what kind
of company you are and you aren't and
 
of company you are and you aren't and
I'll give a very real example Athena is
 
I'll give a very real example Athena is
a compliance company right when I joined
 
a compliance company right when I joined
and this is still true our mission and
 
and this is still true our mission and
values our mission statement is to build
 
values our mission statement is to build
inclusive and ethical workplaces so you
 
inclusive and ethical workplaces so you
can imagine we attract a certain kind of
 
can imagine we attract a certain kind of
employee who wants to work here one of
 
employee who wants to work here one of
the things that we realized was
 
the things that we realized was
happening is I think quite common across
 
happening is I think quite common across
employees is they will fill in the gaps
 
employees is they will fill in the gaps
with the unspoken things and so many of
 
with the unspoken things and so many of
our candidates were filling in the gaps
 
our candidates were filling in the gaps
and when they read inclusive and ethical
 
and when they read inclusive and ethical
workplace they read fun they read family
 
workplace they read fun they read family
and the reality is we are not a family
 
and the reality is we are not a family
environment we are a very hardworking
 
environment we are a very hardworking
team we are incredibly Talent dense the
 
team we are incredibly Talent dense the
performance bar is so high like I I
 
performance bar is so high like I I
truly cannot emphasize that enough and
 
truly cannot emphasize that enough and
we realized that because we weren't
 
we realized that because we weren't
saying that people were reading
 
saying that people were reading
inclusive and they thought that meant
 
inclusive and they thought that meant
we're just a family and and it that's
 
we're just a family and and it that's
just not the case and so we ended up
 
just not the case and so we ended up
having to go back in our recruitment
 
having to go back in our recruitment
process and and I kid you now I kid you
 
process and and I kid you now I kid you
not our recruitment process is so direct
 
not our recruitment process is so direct

you wish you all the best that's amazing
go find that company for you but this is
 
go find that company for you but this is
not it and so we set that tone and
 
not it and so we set that tone and
expectation from the beginning and so I
 
expectation from the beginning and so I
would imagine that companies who are
 
would imagine that companies who are
running into issues with claims so on
 
running into issues with claims so on
and so forth I would want to root into
 
and so forth I would want to root into
the underlying issue and then make sure
 
the underlying issue and then make sure

like one of the most important levers in
 
like one of the most important levers in
dealing with these situations
 
dealing with these situations
I will add one very quick note because
 
I will add one very quick note because
what I don't want people to walk away
 
what I don't want people to walk away
from this discussion thinking is man if
 
from this discussion thinking is man if
we could just get employees to keep
 
we could just get employees to keep
their mouth shut not talk to each other
 
their mouth shut not talk to each other
just let us do our jobs right I don't
 
just let us do our jobs right I don't
think that's what any of us are saying
 
think that's what any of us are saying
for the record like I'm I'm GNA be super
 
for the record like I'm I'm GNA be super
clear here I think it's actually a great
 
clear here I think it's actually a great
thing that employees are talking to each
 
thing that employees are talking to each
other I think it's a great thing the
 
other I think it's a great thing the
employees are becoming more aware of
 
employees are becoming more aware of
their legal rights and protections I
 
their legal rights and protections I
think there are too many cases of people
 
think there are too many cases of people
who didn't speak up who were genuinely
 
who didn't speak up who were genuinely
mistreated discriminated against
 
mistreated discriminated against
retaliated against and got no justice
 
retaliated against and got no justice
because they were too scared they didn't
 
because they were too scared they didn't
understand their rights so I want to I
 
understand their rights so I want to I
want to put that out there I don't think
 
want to put that out there I don't think
the problem is employees are talking to
 
the problem is employees are talking to
each other or employees are speaking too
 
each other or employees are speaking too
much and I don't think that the are
 
much and I don't think that the are
advocating for themselves too much and I
 
advocating for themselves too much and I
don't think the solution is try and
 
don't think the solution is try and
quell all discussions
 
quell all discussions
I think the solution is except that
 
I think the solution is except that
employees are going to talk except that
 
employees are going to talk except that
employees are hearing these words
 
employees are hearing these words
everywhere and so what are you doing to
 
everywhere and so what are you doing to
try and help control the narrative and
 
try and help control the narrative and
make sure that they are not filling in
 
make sure that they are not filling in
the gaps with misinformation right what
 
the gaps with misinformation right what
are you doing to make sure understanding
 
are you doing to make sure understanding
that this is non-negotiable this is the
 
that this is non-negotiable this is the
way of the world now okay we're Global
 
way of the world now okay we're Global
we've got Tik Tac we got all the things
 
we've got Tik Tac we got all the things
what are you doing to try and make sure
 
what are you doing to try and make sure
that the information that they do get is
 
that the information that they do get is
actually useful and not going to be
 
actually useful and not going to be
detrimental both to themselves and to
 
detrimental both to themselves and to
the company yeah and the your your
 
the company yeah and the your your
processes are sound and consistent and
 
processes are sound and consistent and
quality so that you can figure out when
 
quality so that you can figure out when
someone's been wronged and do the right
 
someone's been wronged and do the right
thing versus maybe not and separating
 
thing versus maybe not and separating
you know the signal from the noise is is
 
you know the signal from the noise is is
hard sometimes but really necessary
 
hard sometimes but really necessary
because some people are genuinely
 
because some people are genuinely
treated very unfairly and illegally to
 
treated very unfairly and illegally to
your point yeah I mean Kelly I think you
 
your point yeah I mean Kelly I think you
you've heard me say this in the past but
 
you've heard me say this in the past but
when I was 8 years old I got chickenpox
 
when I was 8 years old I got chickenpox
my mom had to stay home with me and she
 
my mom had to stay home with me and she
was terminated the next day and and so
 
was terminated the next day and and so
like like that's what happened you know
 
like like that's what happened you know
in the 90s it does still happen I think
 
in the 90s it does still happen I think
we can all agree at a a decreasing rate
 
we can all agree at a a decreasing rate
which is the right thing I'll I'll leave
 
which is the right thing I'll I'll leave
our audience with this which is you know
 
our audience with this which is you know
what is what is it the Bambi Golden Rule
 
what is what is it the Bambi Golden Rule
it's just treat others the way that you
 
it's just treat others the way that you
want to be treated and if you're in one
 
want to be treated and if you're in one
of these situations too I'll say this as
 
of these situations too I'll say this as
well it is scary it is it is absolutely
 
well it is scary it is it is absolutely
scary to be threatened when you think
 
scary to be threatened when you think
you haven't done anything wrong because
 
you haven't done anything wrong because
you're not only thinking about what the
 
you're not only thinking about what the
punishment could be for the company or
 
punishment could be for the company or
what the company's going to go through
 
what the company's going to go through
it you're also thinking about your own
 
it you're also thinking about your own
personal reputation and how your
 
personal reputation and how your
personal reputation you know can be on
 
personal reputation you know can be on
the line in these situations and so the
 
the line in these situations and so the
last plug I'll make is this is why
