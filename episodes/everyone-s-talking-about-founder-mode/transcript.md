what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segments today we
are going to discuss founder mode so let
me set the scene here Kelly over the
weekend as I do I was scrolling Twitter
you know mindlessly and I came across
Paul Graham article on Founder mode and
Paul Graham for those of you who don't
know is one of like the OG y combinator
people he does a lot of writing online
he's invested in some of the the biggest
and best startups that we all know and
love Airbnb one of the biggest and uh
this weekend he put out this article
called founder mode and essentially what
it gets at is a conversation he was
having with Brian chesky who's was
araban B CEO and the I'll just read this
section because I think it's really
interesting and it's a of the talk uh
that he had with Brian and it's Founders
feeling gaset and the reason why is
because people have told them to hire
people and to let them just run the
company and don't micromanage them just
like let these people trust them blindly
and let them run the company and and
every single time Brian has done that in
his words he said that he has been
burned and so Brian is now running the
company in what he calls founder mode
which basically means for every high
priority that he has he is getting to
the lowest level of detail and he is
doing what some people will call as
micromanaging so this is now taking
storm like every single founder I think
in my community has either posted about
this or I said something about it on
Twitter or LinkedIn and I would say 98%
of the responses from Founders is
overwhelmingly positive so Kelly what is
your take on Founder mode have you heard
that term before Nolan no it's a new
it's a new term okay I okay good because
I I hadn't heard it before but I I do
like in this article it says a
prediction I'll make is that once people
kind of figure out what found remote is
and can Define it and touch it and feel
it it's going to become a thing which I
appreciated and I I read this article I
I I really liked it um I saw a lots of
similarities and themes in this that
we've been talking about in different
segments and episodes the past year do
you know what I mean which is like
Founders are different and in my 15
years inventure specifically working
with many of them and talking to them I
do think that they go through this
turmoil and if those of you who are
listening please tell me if it's correct
or not they go through this like tension
of everyone kind of telling them to be a
certain way work a certain way you get a
lot of terms of like you're zero to one
can you go to one to two can you scale
right like they're they're they're going
through this identity thing where a lot
of the stuff that they're being told is
against their grain so to speak um and
this is where I go to to work with these
folks you have to be able to meet them
where they are and understand because it
is their baby and it's very hard to just
give it away and and hire strangers so
to speak to like be fully responsible
for those babies and I understand that
tension and that that's a very hard
thing to let go of and I think a lot of
these people that are hired in I'll be
really honest I think they like to tell
Founders what they like to
hear and that sometimes is not only not
always in the best interest of the
founder if you know what I mean because
it can be frustrating to work with
Founders so I empathize with the
operators as well but I think it's a
really hard spot for these Founders to
be and my bottom line is I think we have
to have more empathy for them uh and
allow them to kind of get get into the
weed so to speak when they want to
that's so in yeah I mean more empathy
for Founders is maybe the most
contrarian thing that you've said on the
show I mean believe me I've worked with
Founders that are pain in the ass that I
didn't like but they did found something
they did build something like they're
brilliant in their own way I'm just
saying if you think you're going to be
an operator that's going to come in and
pound your chest and do your stuff like
that's not how they think yeah it's look
I I strongly agree with you and um
here's what I would say is like I think
the people will read this article and
say great now Paul Graham and Brian
chesky have told every founder to start
micromanaging every aspect of their
business like that's what the that's
what the naysayers are going to say and
I I don't think that that's it I I
actually think what's going on here is
that we we are exiting an era uh of
where there was a lot of high-powered
Executives that didn't do inside of
a company they came in they're very good
orators they're very good at
relationships they're very good at
making people feel good and Founders got
Spellbound by these folks and trusted
them and ultimately what happened is
they hired very big teams and didn't
produce results results is the thing in
every company and and this is for
everyone who's listening it doesn't
matter if you're in Tech or if you're in
any other uh line of work this is an
article that you should read because the
smartest and best founders of our
generation are saying like I actually
strongly agree with this and so my
interpretation of what it means
is there are priorities inside of a
business that really really matter and
the founder needs to be all over those
priorities and even though the founder
may be delegating those priorities to
aspects of his or her team that team is
going to have the founder looking over
their shoulder to ensure that those
priorities are moving in the way that
the founder expects that's not
micromanaging that's just making sure
that like we're staying in alignment now
I I still think it will be weaponized
because some Founders and actually many
Founders and many managers candidly are
terrible managers right like the the
world is full of God awful managers and
that includes Founders that includes
execs that includes middle managers and
I think people like those people are
going to this and be like yeah like my
management style has been validated and
I don't think that's right either but
what I I think is coming here is a much
much closer lens on what really matters
inside of a business and people are
going you know people who run companies
are going to look into that and make
sure that there is alignment in that
business and that's okay that is good
and I think that's what we're going to
expect moving forward yeah I I hope this
does not get weaponized and you know
that that's that's the hard thing about
and we've talked about this a ton on the
show that's the hard thing about all
these things is you can take any article
or point of view or quote and you can
use it and swing way one way or swing
way the other and you can you know get
get an article anything on the internet
to support your viewpoints what what I'm
reading here is like Founders have a
certain mindset and DNA and makeup most
of them and and Executives and operators
have a certain DNA and makeup and the
best thing we can do is bring those two
things together like that's where I've
seen it go go bad is when you know a
Founder will hire someone with the wrong
mindset and it I I do believe this
starts with mindset um and that mindset
is do I care about what this founder
cares about can I start with where
they're at and help them operate from
there maybe see things that they might
not be seen But in a lens where I'm
still
protecting why they built this thing and
what they care about and if you can't do
that and you're going to again kick and
stomp on this and that because you can't
build an Empire and they're not
listening like go work somewhere else
like that's what I say at the end of the
day like I have not liked every founder
I've worked with I have not but at the
end of the day you have to respect who
they are what they've built how their
brain works and try to work with it
because it is their company you know
what I mean and I have seen them get gas
lit by people including board members
right who push them in certain
directions or Venture and this you know
and that's just not right and so you
know I'll take Todd at pendo you know
he's none of us are perfect he's not
perfect but you have to work with them
and respect them for who they are and
where they're at and try to change what
you can and know what you can't and
decide if you can live with it or not
and a lot of that is they want to know
what's going on again it's their house
it's their baby and sure sometimes they
break in and bust the door down you got
be listen you can come in knock on the
door right like your kids like kid
 
going knock first for like 20 seconds
like there's a way there's a way to do
that where it's not distracting or too
powerful or you know mowing people over
which I've seen but that's not what
we're talking about and we've talked
about this before
it's great when the founders are
interested like he wanted to dive way
deep in our recruiting process and be
involved like awesome you care about
this uh and so I think again I'll go
back to mindset and I think this I hope
people read this and we find a way to
blend the two this is not either or
Kelly I think that's maybe the most
important thing you've ever said on this
pod wow this is a really strong segment
for me according to you I look and
here's the reason why is because I have
been in that seat to where a Founder has
started to to give me the proctology
exam in my
world and the immediate response is
defensiveness that's almost how everyone
responds in that moment it feels like
they don't trust you it feels like
they're looking for something that's off
and you get into this like shelled up
Zone to where you're trying to protect
your world
and you are coming at this problem from
such a different angle which is like
great come on in help us we don't have
all the problems solved this isn't you
know the world's best people orc but we
want you in here because we want to make
sure we're building something that's
aligned with your
vision and that is such a better way to
operate than the way that I used to
operate which was like hey just hand it
to me let me handle these things like
I'm going to take care of it and you
know I'm just going to go put wins on
the board and then you'll trust me when
the wins are on the board and that way
does work if you have like deeply
established relationships and the thing
that you're working on isn't the most
important thing to the founder but it's
okay if the founder comes in and starts
looking at things and it's I think the
way to think about it is is like don't
let that initial
fear drive your behavior with your
founder yeah instead do what Kelly's do
what Kelly's suggesting which is lean in
bring them in show them everything open
the kodo to them and let them see
everything in there and Kelly it's I
mean you're teaching me about this I
think this is a really really good take

honest like I'm not good at a lot of
things I'm really good at some other
things I do think working with Founders
has been something that I
gotten really good at and I like it and
I that's what I do when I you know coach
others and work with others now is help
them work successfully with Founders and
I have not always been good at it right
like 15 years ago I was like that I was
very like oh gosh I'm doing something
wrong or I need to protect this I need
to like make sure that I seem like we we
have it together I mean that's a very
natural human response and over time you
actually learn they're not asking
because they're trying to catch you or
they think you're doing something
terrible and I'll I'll be very honest
with the audience right now that
feeling goes away as you get older and
like you may need the job less do you
know what I mean like I'm not protecting
a job anymore I don't I don't need to be
here I like to be here great come on in
like it's it's different as well the
other piece is ego though well know but
I'm just saying for those of you who
like for me it was fear of you know
perception of not performing or getting
your stuff done like if you can let go
of that earlier in your career it's just
going to be a lot better but it was
harder for me to do that I was 30 years
old I was young you know what I mean and
now yeah 46 you don't need a job great
everyone give me a proctology come on in
like yeah it's it's a lot easier and I
will be honest that's the human nature
of it if you can try to let it go early
ier it was a false pretense for me back
then yeah I wish I would have had it
different view the thing for me was ego
which was just like hey I got this
figured out like I don't need God no
you're not you're you're
kid no way oh I hope everybody heard
that for everybody yeah yeah no I
appreciate it self awareness is the
first step ego from the the perspective
of like I got this covered I get it I
get it you know like I got this covered
and one of the things as I've been
really lucky to interact with people
like you and really smart people every
day throughout my career is the people I
admire most now are the ones who are
just like I don't actually have
everything figured out it's so much more
Earnest and real and human than the
natural inclination especially as we're
ascending in our careers and maybe
taking on more responsibility the
natural inclination is to be like I'll
get it covered like I'll figure this
thing out versus I actually don't know
like that answer right now I can go
figure it out you know I can talk but
what do you
think so much better it's also so much
more enjoyable like it gives everyone
like power to be like I don't know but
let's figure this out and it's like you
said it's Earnest it's authentic I
always tell my wife no one likes a know
at all no one likes a know at all like
it's just be better to work with folks
that you can figure stuff out together
and not everyone has the answer because
they don't Founders in you know totally
and and on that note Founders don't like
know it else either like you know I
always say I interview with Founders
like we want people that come in here
with open minds that maybe are open to
doing different things maybe they don't
know the answer we'll figure this out
together they love problem solving and I
think that's for me the biggest
realization is before where you and I
early on would be like oh they're coming
in we got it they generally like like to
help and they like to learn they're very
curious individual yeah and sometimes
that can be misunderstood well it also
turns out that a thing that worked at
one
company will not work the same at the
next company it may work better it may
work worse and so you know I think
that's the other thing too is like we're
exiting this era of playbooks like if
you say Playbook now I'm bringing my
playbook to a Founder you will
immediately never have another
conversation with that person ever again
yeah and Founders are in a first
principal mode because like their
business is different the world is ever
changing and things that that worked 5
years ago two years ago even don't work
anymore today or they don't work with
the same uh you know Effectiveness yeah
and so I I think it's like one of those
things Kelly that you know Jeff Bezos my
favorite Bezos quote is will you gamble
with me because we don't know what the
answer is even if we've seen a pattern
before or tried something else at
another place times have changed and
they're ever changing and so I think
this is more about like will you gamble
with me and can we gamble with Founders
together in a way that like you know
we're aligned and even if we are Miss
align like let's go look let's go figure
it out let's see what happens if we run
this experiment and I think that's the
the future of like really working well
with Founders well I think if you're
going to work with Founders you kind of
have to go into it with that right it's
it's what are we going to do together if
you have a view and I have a view like
even if you have full conviction that
this is the way you should do it and
you're in manager mode and you tell them
we have to do a manager mode path and
let's just say they listen and they're
like all right Nolan and they do it and
it's wrong I'm telling you these
Founders have elephant brains like they
like three years later they'll be like
I'm never listening I should I shouldn't
have done that like but if if you work
through it together and you listen to
them and you still chose your path they
wouldn't react right with with such a
reaction but they they get really upset
when they agree to something that in
their gut they they did not want to do
and they do it anyway they will blame
manager mode for like a long time so
best to blend the two I don't know what
that word is maybe it's what is
it what's founder and manager together
but that's the mode like it's not one or
the other yeah manager mode manager
mode fager what do you guys
think I love it Kelly I I love it and I
think you know I've learned a lot from
you over the course of last year I think
this is like this is an area to where
people should listen to Kelly on this
topic because you know whether it's a
Founder whether it's a CEO that's like
really Hands-On you know whether it's
like your boss who's like over your
world this this applies to all of those
relationships and the way I think about
this is like you know there's we all
have relational Capital it's like a bank
and you know the way that you could take
out loans with a low interest rate is by
including that person as part of the
journey and letting them in and showing
them how you're thinking about
trade-offs and showing them how you're
thinking about different you know areas
and that way if you do take a loss that
the loss doesn't hurt you that bad
totally versus like if you want if you
want to go spend a ton of
relational capital is like you go into a
dark hole and you don't share what
you're doing and you come out and the
person who you work for hates that thing
that's how you burn trust to the ground
well and not to get into clinical
therapy mode here but think about
personal same thing same thing outside
of
work it's so true yeah so it's so true
it's a good topic it's an awesome topic
yeah it's an so you know everyone this
is this is like you know we're in the
early Innings of this thing going viral
um so read it and let us know what you
think yeah thanks all see you
