# Solving for False Negatives in Hiring with Arthur Matuszewski

## Transcript

 
what's up friends today we are taking
over the Heretics podcast and giving you
a sneak peek into my new podcast called
 
friends at metaview the reason we built
 
podcast for recruiters hiring managers
interviewers and everybody involved in
hiring doesn't exist until now so today
we're going to show you our episode with
Arthur mateski Arthur blew my mind in
this conversation one of the best
conversations I've had podcasting in the
last two years even if you're on the HR
side you're going to love this episode
and you should totally give it a shot
after this episode do me a favor head
over to our YouTube page and subscribe
to be a 10x podcast listener and without
further Ado here is Arthur mateski on
the newest episode of 10x recruiting
brought to you by medavie what's up
everybody welcome back to another
episode of 10x recruiting brought to you
by metaview I'm Nolan your co-host I got
SLE the CEO of metaview here SLE we
talked to Arthur
mfi what was your takeaways from this
episode first of all takeaway was uh so
glad we got him on the pods awesome
thinker like amazing journey the thing
that really resonated and you just don't
hear almost at all I think in recruit
other recruiting conversations is this
bias towards avoiding false negatives in
hiring more so than necessarily getting
every right I think frankly every
conversation I'm in with recruiting
leaders at the moment there's a lot of
talk about either efficiency or it's
about quality of high and it was so it
was like a bit of a mind shift to think
well no there's a third way or a second
way which is don't worry about quality
of high just like make sure you expose
yourselves to the potential of greatness
if you get it wrong fire them quickly
I'm not saying it's like definitely the
way to go but I think it's definitely
something to think about if you can
build that muscle and maybe if you can
even build a culture where it's really
obvious to anyone applying to a company
that that's the way that they operate
and you're going to get a chance it's
going to be totally fair if you don't
hit the ground run and you're going to
be out you'll get the right people
applying for your company if you have if
you make it very clear that's the way so
anyway I thought that was like an
amazing thought don't Focus don't
fetishize so much getting the hire right
when you have such little information
the reality is when you make an offer to
someone you're never going to have less
information about that person than you
do at that point you're only going to
get more information after they join you
I'm totally with you by the way like i'
never heard anybody describe it like
that it has completely reshift the way
I'm even thinking about Talent as I'm
doing recruiting right now so I I love
that one mine is the only thing that
matters is the value you create so I
think we're exiting this era right now
to where people are pointing to titles
or companies that they worked at like
none of that stuff matters anymore the
only thing that matters is value
creation and I think actually it's it's
up to everybody in the interview process
to prove how you can do that you and I
talk about AI a lot and one of my takes
with AI is like don't worry about
candidates cheating instead worry about
about like what can you learn from this
candidate to apply to your organization
and so I I think we're moving towards
this world to where all that matters is
value creation and you're going to have
to prove that from the time that you're
a candidate all the way through the time
that you're an employee yeah super
interesting I do think there's a world
where you could be more of a passenger
in a company still be quite high
potential have seen what amazing look
like and now looking for your
opportunity to like do it and execute I
think there is something to be said for
like having been surrounded by Elite
Performance means it might be worth
taking a bet on that person in some
cases so I don't know if it'll be like
super like Crystal Clear like just focus
on Purely what they've actually done
maybe there's some other things that
were factoring as well yeah I'm I'm
aligned with you I think the thing that
that Arthur and I were talking about is
like these Halo resumees right these
Halo companies to where it's like I
worked here so like I've checked the box
and now I'm good that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doesn't
matter anymore but that's because those
institutions have also faulted right
there's like the canonical like Fang
companies we all know that they've laid
off a bunch of people because we think
they at least internally the feeling was
that they had gotten fat and they had a
load of people weren't doing any work
and frankly you hear about recruiters
joining meta or something and like it's
okay not to hire anyone for this first 6
months I think people know that now I
think that could just as much be a
reflection of the institutions those
large companies and educational
institions maybe having screwed the
pooch a little bit and they might fix
that and then we will really respect
that again in future so yeah I don't
know how much of that is actually
associated with like a changing time
versus just a like a very temporary well
you know this other thing happened over
here totally do you have any other
takeaways I I do but the force NE is the
big one and I think just maybe one thing
to just stress on that just cuz the
language is not like this false negative
false positive language is not something
people use every day and you didn't go
super deep in it during the Pod just to
be super clear most people when they're
hiring they try and avoid a false
positive a false positive is when you
falsely give someone a yes they didn't
deserve a yes because they're not a good
hitfit for your company you give them a
yes what Arthur describes is he likes to
avoid false negatives he hates the idea
of someone amazing being in his Pipeline
and him not giving them a yes that's the
thing he's trying to avoid above all
else is a scenario where someone who was
good didn't get the opportunity to join
the company and have this outsized
impact on their company all right I've
been podcasting for 2 years or so now
this is one of my favorite conversations
I've ever had the amount of depth here
is is unparalleled so I'm excited for
you guys to enjoy this conversation with
Arthur mateski this is 10x recruiting a
podcast from metaview let's get after it
what's up up everybody welcome back to
another episode of 10x all right Arthur
so I'm going to set this bar very high
for the audience I think think I think
you're one of the smartest people I know
I think you're definitely the smartest
Talent person that I know thank you so
much for being here thank you for having
me I appreciate it I'll try to live up
to the hype yeah don't blow it okay so
uh just I want the quick Arc for the
audience of your career can you give us
like the two to three minute Spiel of
what you've done so far Jan uh so way
back I started a babysitting business
and so uh on the other side of the
recession got a bunch of bankers and
Consultants uh and their unemployed
friends to babysit Upper East Side Upper
West Side families in New York uh we
grew a bunch uh realized uh it's much
more risky once you start putting kids
in cars and so we W up selling the
business and I wanted the Bridgewater uh
not all that different than babysitting
as it turns out but spent a lot of time
uh figuring out what made our people
successful and how do we find more of
them initially started off on the
investment side in emerging markets and
commodities and then wound up working
into General management
uh spent a lot of time uh trying to put
 
assessments and assess uh how their
abstract region could predict future
potential um ran off uh from Bridgewater
to Colorado worked on a marijuana
Venture uh Great Taste of startup life
uh but ultimately more of a science
project than a startup came back to New
York spent a few years in private Equity
Consulting helping boring businesses get
more creative uh wound up uh leaving
that and joining Wayfair and helping
them post IPO scale up across the board
everything from warehouse workers to
data scientists and then had a uniquely
exciting hypergrowth Journey with better
which at one point was linkedin's number
one startup and uh had all the excesses
of the Zer era spent a little bit of
time ping around with a number of VCS uh
and operators uh supporting them in
their businesses and now run carara
which is an operating firm uh helping
investors and their Founders uh at
moments of unique inflection uh on this
intersection between people talent and
business operations okay so uh for the
audience if you listen to your podcast
on like one and a half or 2x speed you
will notice with Arthur you're going to
have to slow it down uh okay so let's
we're gonna get to carara in a little
bit but I actually want to start with
Bridgewater and it's Infamous for the
way it acquires and manages top talent
what were your biggest learnings about
people at Bridgewater um couple couple
fold I think um ultimately you're only
as good as uh the team I think it was an
interesting uh Journey uh of Bridgewater
uh where we spent all this time trying
to identify individual exception uh we
brought those folks together and at the
end of the day we still struggled uh to
make things make sense uh I think that
uh the sum of the hole is not always
greater than its parts uh when the work
is confusing and you're not focused on
uh what will move the needle forward so
much of Bridgewater was predicated on
this notion of not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up and
ultimately I think the challenge of uh
not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up is that incrementally
uh improving things uh is uh you know
its own reward but it's not what uh
exception wants to do day in and day out
uh I think the second piece ultimately
is mostly uh around the idea that um
when you're sort of bringing people in
there's a lot of context and there's a
lot of understanding that gets lost what
made a person successful in one
environment uh is not always what will
make them successful in another and so
this idea of uh we'll find the best of
the best uh and not ask uh for what uh
is challenge I think in every
organization but it's uniquely true when
you're taking entrepreneurs and
consultants and trying to plop them into
a hedge fund and expecting them to know
uh what the most important thing to do
is and then I think the third piece um
ultimately is that um relationships come
from the work um you know Bridgewater uh
was famous for this idea of meaningful
work and meaningful relationships I'm
fortunate to have carried that through
with me throughout my career um but you
uh as much as you can you know put
people through a battery of psychometric
tests and get to know them um it's uh
not until you're getting uh chewed out
by an LP or um you know aggressively uh
debated In the Heat of uh an investment
committee uh that you really come to
understand uh what testing relationship
means and I think that's true for anyone
that's been through any kind of
tumultuous or hypergrowth environment
wow okay so let's start with one which
uh if I can summarize is uh the team is
the most important thing yet when we
think about
recruiting almost everybody myself
included we think about the individual
right we're like we're recruiting for
this role we want to get this type of
person so so you guys realize that
Bridgewater actually like well we can
have the smartest people in the world in
one room but if there isn't like
teamwork or chemistry or those things
like then it's it's it's actually not
working as well so then how do you solve
that problem like how do you recruit for
the team yeah I think it's a great push
and I think um the point you made about
like we're recruiting for this role um
is really critical um you know we ran
into this problem of having you know too
many fbrs as executive assistants and it
turns out trying to schedule a meeting
uh you don't want people debating the
nature of time you want people to just
schedule the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] meeting and uh I
think that's one of the challenges that
comes with this notion of uh let me hire
all all of the Excellence in all of the
world and it's the more common failure
modes I've seen with you know Founders
and Executives across the board is this
idea that um you know uh my role is more
special than another versus really
focusing in on what work uh the job
requires done
and not all jobs will require you know a
perfect SAT score and a Stanford degree
and I think one of the um things that's
hard to weigh um and really only uh can
come with time is this idea that uh the
role is something that uh is not finite
if you need a person uh for a finite
role um you know maybe it's now maybe
it's in 6 months you can get an agent
for that um but really what you're
trying to hire is someone uh that can
understand the context and shape the
concept of what the role should be and I
think ultimately uh finding those folks
that can um you know to borrow a phrase
you know be be barrels and not just
bullets um is the better art of uh Valor
and talent the other thing for me about
Bridgewater that's really interesting is
this culture of
experimentation and maybe this is just
like you know I've read principles from
Rallo and like I've certainly drank the
Kool-Aid from the book but I think one
of the underlying things that makes that
place successful is we're just going to
test out a ton of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and we're not
going to we don't care how crazy the
test sounds we're just going to run it
to the best of our ability we're going
to see what happens we're going to take
those learnings apply what what works
and then get rid of the rest of this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's what I saw from the outside
and examples from this I saw from the
outside is like the dog collector so for
people who don't know the doc collector
is this radical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing to where
you're in a meeting everybody basically
has like think of it as like a like a
scorecard on the person on every person
in the meeting and you could score them
as like after the meeting ends like oh
I'm giving Arthur an eight for this
podcast and then at the end of the day
you had all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from every
conversation or every meeting you've
been in and like numbers and scores
associated with that person that is such
a wild experiment
but it feels like Bridgewater is like
the only place doing that like do you
think that that is actually a helpful
type of culture like it seems to work
for Bridgewater and I guess my question
is is like why aren't more companies
innovating like that like is it too much
yeah I think it's a great question I
think ultimately uh the view I came out
with is that your cultural strategy
comes from your business strategy and
not the other way around Bridgewater's
business strategy ultimately was about
reducing the risk of human error and
making better investment decisions over
time the only way you can get to being a
better investor is to write down your
bets and measure them uh month over
month year over year decade over decade
and so a lot of that culture of
experimentation and really systematic
first principles based research came
from that that probably doesn't apply
the same if you're just trying to ship a
cal to Market or be uh you know the
quickest mover in a new space where you
have to land and expand and prove your
worth um the reality is um
experimentation is easier to do if you
have you know a national research budget
or your margins are better than cocaine
and that's not true for most uh most
businesses and so uh I think personally
and spiritually I'm long experimentation
um but I think most people convince
themselves uh when they have failures
that they experimenting and they don't
necessarily have the intellectual
discipline to truly control the
variables and truly try to get to um
what a meaningful uh conclusion could
look like and so I think the the balance
between the experimentation culture and
why don't more companies do it is that
um folks like to subscribe to you know
the same old ideas about what works or
to listen to their investors or to uh
try to um you know just parro the things
that they're hearing on podcasts or on X
and ultimately I think uh What uh the
actionable takeway from Bridgewater is
is really to yourself to intellectual
task and be uh uniquely and ruthlessly
honest uh in terms of the reasons you're
doing things and why those things may or
may not be right for your moment in time
in your unique context wow okay so I I
think
like my my take on the amount of
experimentation is like I'm addicted to
those things because like I always feel
like there's like uh continuous
iteration I think is the way to to build
a great business and uh it seems like
Bridgewater did that in every aspect of
the business especially with people I
guess like a question and offshoot of
that culture is like could people handle
it like you know I I noticed this like
right now with like my family members
who don't work in Tech like the amount
of change happening in the world right
now with like Ai and po there's just
like melt like their brains are melting
and they can't handle this and I
actually feel like most humans fall into
that category
so like with all of the change that you
guys had all the time right with these
different people programs and like how
we thought about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like was there
like a small subset who like these were
the people who could actually handle
this or like did you guys have to bring
people along consciously to ensure that
like they felt safe in their work yeah I
think this concept of safety uh is an
interesting one because I think uh
there's a certain uh toughness of the
ego that comes from it being constantly
under challenge uh I think ultim
um I for the the senica quote but some
version of uh you know like it's the
battles that we fight in our minds uh
that show up the most uh every day and I
think one of the things the Bridgewater
was good about was taking those mental B
battles and models and making them
explicit um we're in a unique place um I
think uh as a society as a people where
so many mental models are being
challenged and uh fought over that folks
are largely uh either subscribing to um
a party line or subscribing to uh you
know their next favorite Twitter
influencer uh and not doing their own
underwriting and I think what was unique
about the folks that made it through
Bridgewater is they were uniquely good
at uh this concept of to use and
constantly updating you know the idea of
themselves as well as the idea of
themselves operating within Bridgewater
um you know there was a fairly High
attrition rate there was a very high uh
failure rate of new hires um but
ultimately the folks that made it to the
other side were the ones that were
willing to uh question things that have
made them successful and try to write a
new playbook and a new script for how
they might show up at Bridgewater and I
think that's actually the useful thing
that Bridgewater and its Alumni network
has spawned is this idea that um
particularly within our own careers like
we're not just uh our greatest hit we're
actually constantly trying to be in the
kitchen innovating becoming better
versions of ourselves and I think that's
ultimately you know some of the the
stuff that's been popularized is like
fixed versus growth mindsets because the
only safety that you really have is in
being able to bet on yourselves um it's
not Bridgewater that made those people
great it was their ability to make
themselves great within Bridgewater and
I think that's um something that's
thankfully stayed with me and with a lot
of the folks I've had the privilege of
working with over time yeah I can tell I
mean it seems like a Common Thread
between you guys okay last question I'm
and then we'll move on which is like you
you just said something uh kind of like
offhand which is uh the the attrition
rate of new hires was quite
High I'm assuming you guys tried to
solve that
problem uh and then got to the
realization that it turns out uh hiring
is an imperfect game interviewing is
imperfect and we just have to be
comfortable with missing and so what
we're going to get really good at is
fixing those misses is that an accurate
statement slight edit on that I think we
were more concerned about the false
negatives than the false positives um
and so I think our challenge was not to
solve for the people that didn't work
out on brid at Bridgewater it was to
solve for the folks that went on to get
a Theo fellowship or to start uh unique
Venture that provided outsize return um
there's a a lot of those folks where um
over the years we might have
disqualified them because they AR show
up skewed to whatever heuristic we were
indexed on and the thing that was unique
about Bridgewater is like we would find
that one exceptional person or persons
um and really try to study the case for
where we went wrong for either not
hiring them or not uh being able to
unlock their potential at Bridgewater
and I think it's something that um has
personally stayed with me uh the most is
that um most of the time you're graded
on how big your wins are uh not on um
you know keeping losses to a minimum um
and I think particularly within the sort
of idea of talent and talent strategy as
a portfolio
um you see this in most organizations
where you know the majority of
outperformers are the ones that drive
the organizational momentum and generate
outside value and we spend so much of
our time trying to manage towards uh
this messy middle um and I think the
reality is like we're reconstructing
organizations in real time uh
particularly with the Advent of AI um
and so it becomes less about headcount
preservation and more uh sort of work
optimization and it sounds a little bit
less kth to to share that but I think in
a world where your outperformers have
the power of AI that statement will only
become more and more true you keep
saying these like profound things kind
of like you know in in this amazing like
context that you're providing one
another one of those things that you
just said was we looked at the people
who we didn't hire that went on to do
amazing things and then went back and re
did you say reviewed like what you guys
missed about that yeah it's very much
like the higher anti- portfolio as an
idea um and so understanding uh what we
got wrong I think of you know some folks
uh that we actually did hire that um you
know were on the cusp and we somehow
gold coined and pulled them over um and
largely it was the people that didn't
look like the people that we'd hired
before you know it's like the intern
that um didn't turn into a single
research assignment for the entire 12we
internship but then you know produced a
binder full of insights uh from hanging
with you know the folks at Goldman's
desk or um you know the kid with like a
 
been running a trading book and not
going to class um in both of those cases
we're thankful to have hired them but
ultimately in the cases uh of you know
the person that went to go build um a
new uh a new crypto uh asset um you know
it's our are bad for not recognizing
that you know sometimes like the lateral
potential is harder to spot with the
conventional indicators wow
that is just it's so fascinating to me
and something that I've never even
considered is like of course that's
something we should do is if we're
talking to these amazing people and then
they go like you know because this
here's the thing is like you're talking
to so many amazing people but what
you're talking about is like truly these
n of ones that go on and do something
unbelievable that you miss on and so
it's like go learn from them and then
the other thing I think I'm taking away
from the hiring approach is just uh what
did Henry used to say CEO of CA is like
instead of thinking about what could go
wrong think about what could go
right right is like with these people is
like having more of this like glass half
full approach on what they could do it's
such an interesting reframe I do think
like what's unique about Bridgewater is
you fix the mistakes and you fix them
very quickly and that's typically where
companies do not actually like do not
follow through and do not do a good job
it goes back to the intellectual honesty
I think uh it's you know it's one thing
to look at the people that are still in
seat years down the line um but it's uh
you know the true measure is uh you know
all the impact that might have been
might have been captured might have been
within your organization that you know
for fader Fortune isn't there yep okay I
want to quickly talk about better.com
so uh for those that don't know
better.com was one of the fastest uh
growing companies I think of all time um
the valuation was like it got to
astronomical Heights very very quickly
uh undoubtedly I think was like one of
the leaders in the space um and then a
viral moment happened to where a layoff
basically it was a layoff that went
wrong uh went around the world everybody
saw it um and then you know I think that
was like the that that really popped the
hole into the balloon of the company um
I I still think it's around think it's
doing okay but like not as as what it
was once
was what were your learnings from better
totally I think we uh did a lot of
things right we did a lot of things
wrong I think the you know real is it's
hard to be remembered for your worst
moment and not your best um ultimately
uh I think from day one uh the team uh
aspired to and at some point achieved
like a uniquely High Talent density I
think that's what made the balloon
popping uh so painful it wasn't just you
know all the lives that were impacted
and everyone that suddenly uh you know
going into the holidays was
unfortunately without a job um but it
was the reality that you know years
later when I'm catching up with folks
it's still like the sense that like oh
those times were really good we were
really cooking we were really doing
something special um and I think the
hard thing uh and what we got wrong uh
ultimately was uh you know this idea of
like getting high on our own Supply I
think uh at some point when uh when
SoftBank came around and uh we thought
uh we're on top of the world we could
hire you know anyone we wanted to do
anything we wanted um you know that
momentum uh unfortunately sort of pulled
us off a cliff um and uh I think the the
challenge is losing that thread of
intellectual honesty where you know we
were for a unique period of time really
able to produce a lot more uh you know
Revenue per loan and uh all the leading
metrics that you'd underwrite to say
like hey um they're really doing it um
and I think when gravity came down um
you know my strongest held least
productive belief is that water will
find its level it's really hard to
predict when uh that'll happen or how
quickly um but I think uh we don't have
enough uh integrity and safeguards to to
prevent that from happening and uh
unfortunately I think you know we were a
little bit ahead on calling it and uh
letting everyone go but because of that
speed because of that um urgency uh you
know we wound up bearing the brunt uh
just viably of you know the uh media and
everyone picking this up and really kind
of uh making a show of what happens when
uh you you know mistake the mistake the
plot for for the destination the other
thing I'll add on better is like it
feels like that company uh with with
what had happened it was at like the
perfect moment for like the the viral
short clips plus employee
activism plus it had never happened
before right and so you kind of get this
like Perfect Storm of events to where
that layoff gets recorded it goes hyperv
viral [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everywhere and then I
remember seeing it and being like thank
God that that had not happened to me um
and I think that's actually like a
really important framework for people to
think about what you said is so true
which is like it often we remember
things or people or companies for like
their worst moment and it just
completely gloss over everything else
that that went well there and I just I
would I would tell people one of the
things I'm learning in my life right now
is to try and realize that like social
we're in this era of social media right
now to where it's like really easy to
just get a sound bite and then let your
mind run away with a story on everything
else that happened there like I had met
V was the CEO of better it was one of
the most astonishing and
thought-provoking conversations I've
ever had in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] life and and so I
think it's like that's really helpful
context for people the other thing that
you just said which keeps coming up for
me of like why I really like hanging out
with you is you keep saying intellectual
honesty can you define that for people
and like
uh I would just Define that for people
for me yeah totally um you know I think
at the end of the day um it's having
consistency between you know the um
ideas that you're espousing and you know
the behaviors that you're practicing I
think at some point um if you're um out
there you know talking a book um and uh
you know Shilling uh whatever the uh
ideas of the day are and you're not
actually updating and holding yourself
to task uh about whether or not uh these
things actually work themselves out uh
in real life um that's where you can uh
sometimes get LED astray um I think it's
easy to fall in love with Your Darlings
and uh just uh Carry On Without You Know
checking your details um going deep into
uh you know the way your day-to-day is
being uh managed it's the thing I'm most
paranoid about as like a leader as an
operator is that um once you lose sight
of focusing on the work um it's easy to
come to believe that you're more
successful than you are and I think the
cautionary tale of most of the Zer era
not just better but sort of the entire
curve of companies is um you know the uh
Market as a whole rewarded this ability
to be loud in public and to um you know
uh sort of uh pitch three times and
execute once um and as multiples have
come down and as the market has stopped
uh rewarding you know excess um what
you've seen is a lot of folks uh either
having to acknowledge that their
businesses aren't as great as they were
or that um you know they need to um you
know to borrow the phrase go back into
founder mode to rearn the right to
perform at the level that they're
expecting to another thing you said
which actually transitions into carara
um you have this thing of like focusing
on the work uh and that that seems to be
like a Common Thread of of stuff that
you've been saying to me over the course
of the last couple of months so let's
get into carara so you're helping early
stage companies laid the foundation
for exceptional talent and
operations you wrote a letter when
announcing the company and this is the
paragraph that like really out to me for
the past 15 years everyone lived under a
comfortable illusion focus on people and
the work will take care of itself this
was by and large true in an age where
the excess Returns on technological
creation outweighed the carrying cost of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
jobs K what does that mean like what do
you mean when you say that like I get we
can you explain that to yeah totally
there there's an article um at some
point in early Co that I remember uh
that came out that really built on this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jobs concept um but I think it
sort of made the case that like hey if
you're um a community manager for um uh
you know farmers in uh Central Indonesia
you probably shouldn't be working in um
you know Chelsea uh trying to uh
optimize uh you know single-payer fery
ization um and I think the reality is uh
a lot of folks uh for many years got
comfortable with this idea of like my my
job title my rank in the organization uh
sort of where I Ascend to um uh in terms
of the Peter Principle is worthy enough
of uh like recommendation and a claim um
but I think that uh the reality is um
and you've seen this kind of with a lot
of the big Tech correction you know most
uh you know acutely met and others that
have uh laid off a lot of Workforce and
productivity has gone up um it just the
reality there is a whole lot of folks
that were not producing um and I think
that in a in the balance between you
know capital and labor you know the
pendulum always kind of swings um but I
think the hard thing um is that uh a lot
of these rituals of you know big titles
of Performance Management of you know
happy happy okrs when everything are
going right is folks weren't digging to
that next level below to understand who
was actually on the keys and who was
producing what um and I think
particularly with um a lot of uh what's
coming out today um you know you're
increasingly only as good as like the
points that you put on the board um and
it's a lot harder to subscribe to uh
this idea that you know because I work
for the fanciest companies or because
I've had the fanciest titles um that's
enough um sort of everyone has to kind
of rearn their stripes and I think as
that happens quicker and quicker um you
know Only Solution really is to focus on
the work being done and making sure that
it's done at the urgency and the quality
that it needs to totally it you know to
use your word illusion which I think is
so good you know I think we're coming
out of this era right now to where it
was easier to point to the company where
you worked your title your tenure at
that place which actually doesn't mean
anything like none of it means anything
actually the only thing that matters is
what value did you create what did you
do and so there's a lot of heat right
now on uh you know Elon said this is
we're filming this on March 3D uh Elon
sent the email of like what five things
did you do last week and by the way he
did that like two years ago with the
Twitter people um but it's actually not
that crazy of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] concept right
it's like I've actually been thinking
about this in my clients it's like I
actually want to proactively send them
an email every week to let them know
what I did because I think it helps me
alignment it it's like you know I have
this concept of like showing your work
like I think it's actually like you
can't just do the work if nobody knows
like you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing it like you're
operating in a silo and it doesn't
matter like you have to be able to show
it and then uh synthesize it and then
tell people about socialize it tell
people about it um Kim Scott had this
thing uh who wrote radical cander she
used to send out Snippets every week to
her boss like you know five or six
snippets on like here's what I did
here's what I got done here's what I'm
doing next week is that what you mean by
like focusing on the work yeah it's not
not a new idea by by any stretch uh but
whether it's Snippets or you know the
things you've done I think the push
you're actually making towards
proactivity is real I think you're
seeing this actually and say you
obviously having run Continuum is like
in this market of like increased
fractional work um as organizations get
unbundled um you know it's not quite
that everyone's just going to move back
towards a billable hour model and sort
of time and material served um but you
are going to get to this place where um
you know folks are questioning like are
you better than the Bots or can I you
know put this uh somewhere you know
cheaper um and Outsource it or can I get
um you know leverage versus uh you know
paying you for goal ownership and I
think this idea of um you know the
hierarchy of work there's a lot of work
that is Administration and execution and
I don't denigrate that you know there's
this high order of work that's a little
bit more specialized whether you're a
lawyer or an accountant or otherwise um
but I think increasingly in a lot of
these um uh particularly early stage
company jobs what you're paid for is
generating momentum um for aligning
Direction and really amplifying and
amping up uh the ability to execute on
that direction and I think it's harder
and harder to just like sit in an
organization and hide there's a whole
Suite of tools out there uh that are um
you know now measuring every click not
just in a sort of M Jiggler kind of way
but actually looking at like hey what
documents have you prod produced um are
your emails High substance and I think
one of the challenges um as the bar for
intelligence goes up with um everything
AI That's Coming Out is like you're
increasingly going to have to be able to
synthesize more and drive uh activity
and for the professionals that aren't
able to do that um you know they're
going to get hit with the what did you
do this week uh not just weekly but
daily and the more that happens uh the
more trust is lost it's one of the
things that I appreciate about sh is um
you know he always had this affection
towards liars poker and sort of the old
school Solomon Brothers aesthetic um but
it's not that you were ever necessarily
fired or anyone came around your desk
and gave you like a fivepoint
performance review you just slowly lost
pull uh because your trades weren't as
good because you weren't executing as
quickly and because you weren't with the
plot um and by no means am I saying
that's the right way to do talent
management but I think there is
something uh very Spartan in this
approach to work uh where if you're
really keyed in on uh how much substance
are you generating and can I hear that
that's the real thing that I'm pushing
my team and um all of us working with
Founders to really try to interrogate
but avoid this idea of you know just uh
underwriting off of like Brands and
signifiers and the bullets that people
resume but actually get to the root of
what did people do and understand what
problems they solved yeah it's also
incredible like how few people actually
do that and so when you do something
something that is quite basic uh how
much it can help Elevate you and help
you stand out from the crowd uh just on
the like things you got done right so I
think a lot about productivity and I
think there's a there is such thing as
productivity masturbation to where like
it feels really good but actually like
you're not doing anything um because
you're in this constant state of the
next thing the next thing the next thing
or like can I make my tools better uh
Shane Parish who runs the knowledge Pro
uh the knowledge project um wrote the
book clear thinking I'm I'm a huge fan
and one of the things he talks about
with knowledge workers you know white
color workers specifically is we don't
normalize having thinking
time how do you think how does like what
you like what you're talking about with
these specific
outputs how does that like match up with
like making sure we're spending enough
time thinking and reflecting on things
yeah it's a great push and think um I
think he has that line of like there's
always something you can do in the
moment to better tomorrow and I think
that's actually you know the
intersection point is there's always a
Time series on productivity where um and
I think good Engineers good product
leaders uh good technologists know this
where it's not actually about um
activity or the lines of code that are
committed it's about when what are those
interstitial moments where you can
really synthesize the problem and
reframe it and realistically that takes
time I think the reason uh it's easier
to fall to activity is because most of
the time when uh there aren't outcomes
uh it's easier to manage process than it
is to manage progress but when you look
back at you know the history of
technological revolutions it's a lot
more punctuated equilibrium it's not
that you know people are linearly
plotting along and getting uh further up
the curve it's um let's Sprint for a
while in this direction realize the
rocket doesn't work and then hard pivot
and run the other way and this idea of
swinging that pendulum from approach is
where I think a lot of that clear
thinking has to happen is like being
intellectually honest really being
rigorous on is all this activity worth
it and even if we wasted a quarter or we
wasted a year or we wasted you know even
more investor Capital um if you continue
to buy your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh it doesn't mean
you're going to get to the right answer
um it's part of why I respect Founders
that can you know uh hang up the Spurs
and say like hey we didn't do it um and
get to the right place we're going to go
uh pivot and truly you know destroy the
thing that we built to build something
new um and I think we all do some
version of that on a more regular basis
and so it's not just about responding to
slacks quicker or being distracted while
you're on Zoom um it's doing kind of the
thing that Jamie Diamond alluded to
which is like actually hashing it out
with people and debating whether or not
the activity that you're doing has any
substance the other thing you just you
didn't explicitly say but that is making
me think about is sunk cost like you
know by saying like oh like it doesn't
matter how how much money we spend or
how much time we spend on this thing if
it's not working you need to be
intellectually honest that it's not
working and go a different direction and
I think the reason people don't do that
and speaking of somebody who has built
his entire career in recruiting and
talent early in my career I had the
hardest time pivoting away from ideas
because I was like oh my my identity got
attached to this thing and my ego got
attached to my idea I told people this
now I'm going to look like an idiot and
go the other way what I have learned as
I've matured is that the smartest people
agnostic of rol just I think the
smartest people I hear speak have no
sunk cost they don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how
much money or time or energy they spent
on a thing they don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about
like how many times they said it the
moment they realize they're wrong they
hard pivot and go a different direction
and that is something I think like many
people in talent and HR can take and
apply because as one of you me I was the
worst at this and the moment I decided
to make that flip it felt like my life
changed and I was like super free to
actually like operate in the real world
and be intellectually honest with myself
do you agree with that like it feels
like some there's something with Talent
people to where like they hold on to
these things like a little bit longer
than everybody else yeah I think you
know it's true in Talent um it's true in
real estate it's true in any kind of
like brokerage business um is like the
first muscle is sales um and uh you're
your easiest Mark um we convinced
ourselves uh you know of the things that
we're trying to convince others um and
you know sometimes this is something I
talked to a lot of our recruiters and a
lot of our talent teams about is that um
you know this isn't a sales conversation
you're not trying to win the argument
we're trying to get to truth um and I
think uh that ultimately happens uh as
you said like internally first um you
know for me I used to have this uh idea
of um you know love The Underdogs love
the scrappy kids you know gr up in
Queens my family's from Poland I always
had this idea of like you know I'm
always going to bet on um you know the
folks with a little bit less and
hopefully that's a little bit more
upside and I actually had to like really
sort of untrain myself with this idea
that you know at the end of the day um
you can get folks that are potentially
starting from like a different um
plateau and a different uh level and
still sort of track their trajectory and
their slope over time um because it's
not just a bias uh one way or the other
um but it's really uh looking at like
relative impact over time and uh
increasingly I think um you know I still
love yoloing it and falling in love with
candidates and and taking bets um but at
the end of the day you know we're we we
are paid for the for the winners um and
so uh rather be more right than wrong
over time um but the the challenge is is
like um you're constantly trying to
update your underwriting you're
constantly trying to get better at
predicting and uh it is hard to be
consistently right if you're always uh
putting in these um you know beliefs um
you know one way or another yeah so so
at carara how what is your process for
delivering the winners right because
like I'm assuming it's not like here's
my PlayBook that I develop like that
I've once developed and that it works at
every company like what do you do yeah
our our our sort of ideology is
basically the opposite um I've become uh
I've become much uh more suspect of like
playbooks uh as sort of like a new kind
of religion we have a lot of playbooks
we have a lot of biases in terms of how
to do things um but at the end of the
day we're focused not on just bringing
the best supply to the yard but really
indexing more heavily on demand what's
successful at Bridgewater isn't what's
successful at better isn't what's
successful in Babysitting um and uh if
I'm like honest myself uh most of the
time it's trying to get Founders and
leaders out of their own way to really
understand what will truly be successful
in their environment and that requires a
certain amount of back and forth and
Trust um there's always this balance
between client service and client
management um it's dangerous uh to take
directions from tourists because if they
knew where they were going uh they
wouldn't need to ask you um for help and
so you know it's this well informed
balance uh between uh arguing for um you
know what um we have seen to be true in
more situations and really trying to get
to a Bottoms Up view of what does demand
in your organization look like um we see
it a lot with founding Engineers we see
it a lot with founding account
Executives um where you're really trying
to match to the founder um rather than
to even the business problem or the
industry
um and trying to tease out those nuances
and get Founders to be self-aware to be
reflective to be open-minded about their
own biases um that doesn't mean those
biases aren't real it just means um you
have to selectively exercise them and
one of the um one of the things that I
think builds trust with our clients and
it's something we hear time and again is
that um at the end of the day our job is
to sort of hold that mirror up a little
bit closer and show them sort of what
the market is telling them and if we are
able to facilitate that process not
objectively but with insight and with
recommendation and accelerate the time
to that Insight um that's ultimately
where the value is coming from and
that's ultimately where we earn our keep
can you elaborate on how you guys show
Founders what the market say totally um
it sounds cheesy but like we do the work
um we talk to all the people we uh get
the notes you know we're exploring uh
Partnerships like those with uh metav
view to um help us collect the data and
a lot of this is just applying
principles and evidence-based reasoning
to something that often times feels a
little bit more fluffy um you know on
the School of Science versus art um we
probably Veer a little bit more towards
science but at the end of the day it's
hard to replicate taste and judgment and
that's uh where we aspired to excel is
that when we're sharing insights back
based on the evidence um a lot of people
could look at the same body of evidence
and potentially come to different
conclusions um and so that's where we
put our thumb on the scale uh to try to
drive what we think will work that
doesn't mean we always get it right but
when we talk about hiring bets we talk
about it almost like a procurement
decision of uh you know this is the
market this is what we learned this is
where we think price to Value exists and
this is why we think uh this is the
right trade um and ultimately I think
it's that uh substantiation and that
focus with Founders that um I think
builds trust because it's less about
selling them on what we think the right
answer is it's trying to to uh show them
the evidence and together engage in that
process of either agreeing or
disagreeing on where it should take us
is there a so you know you guys
are and this is a terrible way to frame
it but a vendor right you're a third
party right you're not you're you're not
a full-time
employee if you
were would you deliver that to the
founder differently yeah I think uh you
know there's there's integrity and
there's privilege in being on the other
side um we try to stray as close to the
WHERE on your team were embedded as
possible um agnostic of whether you're a
small client or a big client or an
annoying client or an exciting client um
fundamentally I think this idea of what
constitutes the organization is
reshaping uh and the reason that um I
think we can uh push as much as we do is
because we have the benefit of not being
beholden to a single portfolio or being
beholding to a single client um at the
end of the day you know you don't
necessarily care if your doctor's a msan
Mets fan it's it's nice uh if you guys
can get along about um you know your
shared view of the world um but at the
end of the day you're paying for the
expertise um and the fact that um
theoretically uh you know their opinions
uh hold water and that's ultimately um I
think uh where we aspire to I think
being internally I think that's
something that is always a harder trade
which is like am I willing to put my my
salary and my livelihood on the line um
to your point I think um there's uh a
balance between uh being uh Evangelical
and being principled um if you're not
willing to change your mind and you're
always kind of um you know trying to uh
Crusade for something then it's less
likely that you'll be taking seriously
um on each decision um but if you're
showing folks your process if you're
showing folks your data um whether
you're a vendor or whether you're
internal that's the way to earn trust
over time so that you can then you know
exercise more of the Judgment that you
aspire to
yeah the I was having a conversation
with a friend about this this weekend
who was having a hard time influencing
inside of his
company and what I told them was all you
can do is is like the great process work
like what you're describing right which
is like get the data synthesize the data
in the way that's as most objective as
possible and then present the data in a
non-emotional way and then here's the
big thing be comfortable with whatever
the decision is because you may you may
be right you assume you're right like
everyone assumes their right going into
this thing and it turns out my biggest
learning from CA was I was wrong like
 
had this like crazy ability to do what I
thought at the time was insane [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
ended up being totally right and it made
me it made me
rewrite like me and my own opinion and
instead like yes I'm going to come to
the table with
uh options of things that we can do and
my recommendation but I'm not going to
get so attached to my recommendation
because I I am always leaving an
increasingly higher probability that I
am wrong and I think this is the thing
of when you are trying to navigate
internally don't get so tied to your own
ideas you agree yeah I think um yeah
like it's a hard balance it's just a if
you're if you're Henry or if you're you
know founder type um uh I'll be the
first to tell you it's like the you know
the things that uh got you to where you
are um are unique and often times
legendary um but I think creating an
environment uh you know to title back to
the beginning uh like what Ray did um
you know the balance of an idea of
meritocracy is not that you know the
intern with six weeks of experience uh
is going to be right more than you know
ex person that's been doing it um but
it's an it's an ideal environment when
you can get that in turn to test their
ideas and make them better um because on
the off chance that they might be right
you never want to dismiss it um but I
think it's creating a forum where you
can actually talk about the Merit of
different ideas and uh force yourself to
make ideas better um and I think that's
uh it's a hard balance whether you're
internal whether you're external um
because uh ultimately we uh and I
personally appreciate the clients that
we learn stuff from uh more than the
ones that are just um you know happy
going along with what we think the right
answer is um because in the debate comes
um you know value uh and whether that
values you know today or down the line
with the next client um you know the um
I think the you know the opportunity
ultimately um is in finding folks uh
that will challenge you and so if you're
an internal person struggling uh with
being challenged that's the first step
i' check more so than um you know or am
I more likely to be right or more likely
to be wrong Arthur I've been podcasting
now for like two years and this is my
one of my favorite conversations I've
ever had thank you so much for taking
the time thank you noan I appreciate it
this great
[Applause]
