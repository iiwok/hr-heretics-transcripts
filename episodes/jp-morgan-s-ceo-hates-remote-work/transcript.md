hey everyone welcome back to another
segment uh of HR Heretics I hope you all
are doing good Nolan and I are feeling
good this week I just uh gave him some
some rash in the trash by the way right
now for not seeing the movie Casino for
those of you who are Kelly I'm pretty
sure that movie came out before I was
born like un believable it's a Timeless
movie my kids have seen it they're 14
you no I was six great well ass is it in
black and white anyway Casino the
original story about Vegas please please
check that out okay so I wanted to get
your take on this Nolan this is probably
gonna be a short segment uh but I was
watching this YouTube video I don't know
if anyone of you saw this leaked video
AP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond slamming
remot work and just how he was talking
about this and some folks told me you
know he did that on purpose you know
they planted it to get it leaked I don't
really care how it got out there it's
I've thoroughly enjoyed it it was very
entertaining and also I thought it was
kind of real I mean he was you know I'm
paraphrasing but he's just like listen I
know how this works you're all I'm on
Zoom you're all on Zoom you're you're
you're not even paying attention you're
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] texting each other you're
texting about me what an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I am
and you know you get you get work done
you don't get work done you go to
meetings you don't need to go to like
just went on a rant and I really would
love everyone to watch this because it
was entertaining but also it's true I
mean he literally called out it still
happens people are slacking each other
during meetings about the person talking
it's crazy out there and you know I
think I think it ties into this these
expectations of or noan and how how we
were you know maybe 10 years ago how it
was the past four is years and and how
it's swinging back pretty quickly I mean
yeah I'm an interim at Quizlet right now
I go into the office I'm I'm I'm
mandated you are you have been red
pilled Kelly I think is what has
happened is you have been redpilled this
is like your red pill moment like I
can't believe you of all people love
this video that no I have not been red
pilled first of all I don't I don't take
any pills not
no you know anyway different topic um
I've always believed this I never liked
the whole RTO thing just because it was
a no- win situation for HR leaders in
 
agreed it's like it was hell on Earth
but I never actually agreed with void
remote work um but I did agree with
flexibility and I I do agree with
judgment and working together in ways
that that matter versus a schedule for
schedule sake or control or whatever it
is so always agree with that and
everyone knows I love workplace like
Dynamics and the Silling I mean it's
like an episode of The Office it's
hilarious people are on Zoom right their
their t-shirt one you know t-shirt and a
tie and then like boxers in the bottom
they're slacking people they're just I
mean that's how it works that's how
humans work and I thought that Jamie
called it out and actually a very
entertaining yet Accurate Way of how
this stuff works it's a it could be on
TV it could be an episode tot okay so
here's my view of the world one is I
don't know this for sure but I'm pretty
sure he had a plant that recorded this
and made sure the world saw it that's my
view there's no way like when Jamie
Diamond says something he doesn't know
it's being recorded right like secret
audio leaked I was like get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out
of here this guy wanted this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to go
public that's thing one thing two I
posted the audio on on LinkedIn last
week Kelly you did it had
 
unbelievable how much the RTO thing
Riles up the population and here's my
learning so all right so I'll go back to
my time at door Dash Okay so at door
Dash we were all in person we got to
like 250 employees and then we just
couldn't hire super super senior like L8
N9 Engineers we just couldn't do it for
our lives and there was many reasons why
like we were paying under market and all
this other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but the other thing is
is like the the talent pool for that
person is very small right and so I made
this articulation to Tony and to Andy
who was our CTO at the time and I was
like look there's only so many of these
people they are all paid like you know
drug dealers and if they're going to
come work at door Dash we got to offer
them something that they're not going to
get anywhere else and so my view of the
world is like if we opened up the talent
pool by saying like this is the one role
in engineering you could be remote then
it might work like let's test it out we
ended up hiring this dude who was like
living in Hawaii I think that guy's like
still working there today right it
worked out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome the takeaway
though is that everybody thinks they're
in this like top 1% category they all
think they're the best and if you look
at the distribution of performance right
there's only like 3 to 5% of people who
are in that outstanding bucket and then
there's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everybody else so like
clearly 95 to 97% of people are
completely wrong about how the company
views them and specifically their skill
set in today's Marketplace and covid it
just warped everybody's mind saying just
because you can work from home doesn't
mean an employer has to employ you
working from home if they say we stand
for in office six days a week then you
have every right to say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it I don't
want to do that but guess what more and
more employers are at least saying in
office 3 to five days a week like that
is absolutely now the majority of
companies certainly there are exceptions
but then there's trade-offs for the
exceptions because they have a bigger
talent pool such that like they can get
more people such that salaries can be
lower this is the the big moment I think
we're in right now just like as a
society
expectations have to be reset and I
think the reason Jamie posted this clip
on purpose and was intentionally
recorded is because he wants it to be
very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clear that if you come and
apply to JP Morgan this is the culture
you're going to work for yeah um well
said hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview and
I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards metaview changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and and check
out medavie head over to metav view. a/h
Heretics to talk to one of Med's product
experts tell them that me and Kelly sent
you or you could just go to their
website and get started for free you'll
be up running and AI enabled in
minutes I think my last two comments in
all seriousness because I again I said I
found the clip humorous and entertaining
but in all seriousness to disagree with
you yes everyone kind of got this
entitlement mentality and working from
home that's how humans are I mean we we
literally jumped into this everyone was
at home for you know
years you become used to it and you
things some things Come Harder some
things become easier and it's very hard
for us to kind of move back and forth
right little things like you know people
are freaking out that the dog's at home
now now they got to get a dogs it's a
whole thing and yes it could be
entitlement and this and that but it's
also just it's just human nature and we
got used to it and everyone did it and
so even these non one% of talent people
you can see how they got used to it and
became an expectation so now we're kind
of undoing that and to to Jaime's point
it could be Jamie it could be Sally it
could be Jan I don't care it's Clarity
of identity of what you're trying to do
and why you're trying to do it um that's
point one my second point to his other
humorous comments about people you know
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around on zoom and texting each
other about the so true it's so true I
mean come on I've done it everyone's
done it do you know what the anecdote to
that is I swear on all of this stuff is
leadership
um do your employees trust you are do
they believe you do they want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
work for you or are they just muscling
through for a paycheck cuz they're they
feel
stuck do they feel like they're doing
good work and you involve them and it's
engaging and they actually show I I
swear if people feel like that they they
do those things he's joking about so
much less the toxicity kind of goes away
like you know peers hold other peers
accountable for not doing that kind of
crap because they're in but like if you
have a bad leader with a shitty team of
course they're going to do that stuff
because you're a clown like you're joke
to them so I do think one of the major
anecdotes of all this nonsense is
leadership I do I think that's a really
good take it's leadership it's also um
you know you could call it like
missionary versus mercenary sort of a
thing like do you actually have a
company that people want to come work
for and do their best work of their life
right or are they coming and punching
the clock and like every time I go to
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] DMV I'm dealing with Bob
who's drooling who like doesn't give a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about being there who's just like
like intentionally moving slow to try
not to get to the next Customer because
he wants to get to lunch three minutes
early I think that's the other thing too
is it has to be a combination of
leadership and something like that's
motivating employees deeper maybe that's
the missionary mercenary thing but it's
got to be some like we got to motivate
people right and even if the team isn't
motivated by the company itself or the
CEO like you can still bring a group of
people together that's motivated by each
other what you're trying to do I mean it
is definitely possible but I swear if I
took 10,000 companies and I correlated
how much nonsense was going on like
during these meetings and Sid slacks and
crap with the leader and the respect for
the leader and the performance of the
team there's some kind of regression
there we should run that if anyone wants
to help us run that it's like we we
should we I swear it's true so I I do I
do agree with you I I think you're
totally right and I think it's a really
well said point unfortunately right now
we're in a market where companies can
just be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it get back in the
office I'm going to look over your
shoulder yeah well we'll see how that
works out but check out the video If you
