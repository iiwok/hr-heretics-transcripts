unbelievable how much the RTO thing
Riles up the population and here's my
 
Riles up the population and here's my
learning so all right so I'll go back to
 
learning so all right so I'll go back to
my time at door Dash Okay so at door
 
my time at door Dash Okay so at door
Dash we were all in person we got to
 
Dash we were all in person we got to
like 250 employees and then we just
 
like 250 employees and then we just
couldn't hire super super senior like L8
 
couldn't hire super super senior like L8
N9 Engineers we just couldn't do it for
 
N9 Engineers we just couldn't do it for
our lives and there was many reasons why
 
our lives and there was many reasons why
like we were paying under market and all
 
like we were paying under market and all
this other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but the other thing is
 
this other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but the other thing is
is like the the talent pool for that
 
is like the the talent pool for that
person is very small right and so I made
 
person is very small right and so I made
this articulation to Tony and to Andy
 
this articulation to Tony and to Andy
who was our CTO at the time and I was
 
who was our CTO at the time and I was
like look there's only so many of these
 
like look there's only so many of these
people they are all paid like you know
 
people they are all paid like you know
drug dealers and if they're going to
 
drug dealers and if they're going to
come work at door Dash we got to offer
 
come work at door Dash we got to offer
them something that they're not going to
 
them something that they're not going to
get anywhere else and so my view of the
 
get anywhere else and so my view of the
world is like if we opened up the talent
 
world is like if we opened up the talent
pool by saying like this is the one role
 
pool by saying like this is the one role
in engineering you could be remote then
 
in engineering you could be remote then
