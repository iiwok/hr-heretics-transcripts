# The 2026 Recruiting Reckoning & AI Predictions

## Transcript

 
Today we're dropping an episode from
Metav's 10X Recruiting podcast on 2026
predictions on recruiting's AI
evolution.
This is 10X Recruiting, a podcast from
Metaview. Let's get after it. What's up
everybody? Welcome back to another
episode of 10X Recruiting brought to you
by Meteaview. So style, we have had a
bunch of people ping us and say, "Guys,
like we want a a 2026 predictions
episode." So you ask, you receive. Sil
and I have been talking about this for a
couple of weeks now. Sil, you're yours
better be good. Mine are terrific. And I
think we should do this in like the
order of most contrarian to least
contrarian. What are your what are your
thoughts on that? For me, I've got a few
that are like quite more to do with the
recruiting market as or like the talent
market, I would say, as a whole, and
then some that are quite AI specific.
So, I wanted to mix them up a bit in
between. I need to think maybe I need to
think through that. What's most
contrarian here? Listen, I'm just going
to do it in the order that I was
planning to do it. Okay. I don't care.
&gt;&gt; Stop complicating.
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, that may not be
interesting to begin with, so uh we
should prepare for that.
&gt;&gt; Uh well, Sy, let's get in this thing,
man. Like, let's start. What is What is
your first prediction for 2026?
Prediction number one, and I think very
relevant to frankly maybe some people
have appeared on this pod and uh I know
a bunch of people who listen to the pod.
Uh listen, I think it's time to be in
the game. Um
we're all figuring out how work gets
done. I think there's some incredible
talent talent uh within uh VC platform
teams and I think a lot of them are
going to figure out how to get back in
the game and they're going to join uh AI
companies mainly as operators and I
think there'll be a big big exodus. I
don't think this is just talent to be
clear. I think there's a lot of
operators who are sort of in some ways
on on the sidelines in various ways and
they're going to want to get in the game
because this is the gold rush. Not just
because I mean companies are going to
make a ton of money. I mean that too,
but also just because it's like what a
time to be alive. How can you not be
like in the most exciting thing in the
world is to figure out how we're going
to work with AI? So like get in the game
and figure out how to work with AI by
joining one of these AI companies. I
think a lot of the best people are going
to be thinking that.
&gt;&gt; So are you so specifically to like our
audience? Are you saying that you think
you're going to we're going to see a
wave of VC talent partners leave their
VC job and go in-house work at AI
companies?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. VC talent partner exodus is what
I've called this prediction.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh how do I
&gt;&gt; how do I feel about that?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. How do you feel? What do
you think? Do you think it's going to
happen?
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean style, like some of these
VCs
pay insanely well, have huge brands. I
think maybe what I would say to it is I
do think VC the era of VC talent
partners just giving advice is over.
like they they do need to actually be
doing the work. And I think we've seen
that over the course of call it like the
last 12 to 24 months. All of my friends
are actually like doing real recruiting.
Like Audacious has always done it that
way. Some VC firms have always done it
that way, but the bigger ones have
pivoted hard.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Specifically for early stage companies
and early stage investments. So I think
that's certainly happening and already
happening. Do I think they're going to
go inhouse?
Um, I think I think we'll see some of it
for sure. Like it's just some of
&gt;&gt; the the opportunity to get rich is like
so obvious at some of these companies
and so I think it's going to be hard to
pass that up. But you know, life's about
trade-offs. I say this all the time and
I've done some like personal reflection
on this of like would I go in house at
this stage of my life? And the answer is
no. And there isn't well there is amount
an amount of money but it's way more
than what anyone would pay. um for me to
trade off time with my kids and and
choosing my schedule and like, you know,
being at dinner every night and not
having to check Slack. And when you're
in house, you know, a wise person once
told me when they put a VP or a C in
front of your name, they own you. And
that's different when you're, you know,
in a title partner role or doing
boutique exec search.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, this should we just call this
episode things that may or may not
happen next year.
&gt;&gt; Well, I just disagree with you.
So uh all right let me give you mine. So
my my first prediction sorry to
interrupt before we I guess I guess what
of course I did not mean I think every
single person is going to I think I
think I think I'm s I basically agree
with what you're saying which is I think
um notwithstanding some of those things
I think there's a world where like um
that the advantages of being in house
were not so clear versus actually being
a talent and now I think there are
really clear advantages in terms of you
know your advice is not going to be
valuable in 10 years time unless you are
part of actually figuring how this is
happening, you know? So, like, you know,
I guess it frankly relates to stage of
career for the for a person like if
you're if you're in that stage of life,
it's like the time that there'll be a
lot of people who decide they need to
get need to get in the game.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Yeah, I think that's
right. All right, let me give you mine.
So, my first one is AI becomes the de
facto first screen for inbound and
candidates will love it. So, everybody
knows Inbound's a mess. Like, with any
company that has a brand, I I can't tell
you like everybody who I talk to is
like, I don't check my buckets. I mean,
this is going back to when I was at
Google in 2012. It was the joke. We
ended up hiring like a team offshore.
They couldn't get through everything. AI
will help. But the era of the resume as
the only thing that we ask for when we
have a big brand as a company should be
over. It doesn't make any sense. Like
how? Yeah, I could tell some things
based off of the resume, but why not ask
for another piece of information while
also explaining to the candidate why
this is good for them and why they will
stick out and why the inbound bucket of
the past is no longer the future and so
you should do this. I think we're people
are going to start getting hired this
way and I think it's going to make
candidates more likely to be okay with
AI introduced that early and getting
them even more comfortable with AI
assessing them in other ways throughout
the interview process.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you can
totally frame things as a like you're
collaborating with the AI to make it
clear who you are like who you are and
what you're about essentially. It's not
like it is an there's an assessment
occurring and whether the AI is part of
that is it's very connected. It doesn't
have to be. It doesn't have to be the
case though. It may well be, but it
doesn't have to be. Uh, so yeah, totally
agree. I think that I think there's a
world in probably not by the end of this
year, but you know, the generation
that's coming up now will sort of this
idea that the sort of the whole way we
would take in applicants was based on
something that was essentially connected
to the fact this used to be a piece of
paper. It had to it had to used to
actually be a piece of paper you give
someone that would just be like what it
was like. So we had we've had all these
years where we try and almost just keep
it almost like as a piece of paper when
you could have all this rich media about
someone instead. That seems that seems
crazy. So yeah, I I agree. I I think I
think the timings will be interesting on
it. I think old I think behavioral
change obviously is like incredibly
tough but uh but we got some things
cooking on that front and I I think
there's uh I think uh there's a exciting
things of foot. I agree. Do you you were
talking about um you said screen. Can
you just explain to people what you mean
by the sort of when you say screen, what
do you mean?
&gt;&gt; I think it's going to be different.
Well, it will it will be different for
different companies in different roles.
So, I'll give an example. Um, I'll start
with like a basic example is like
Chipotle is actually already doing this
right now for line workers. Like
literally right now the application
process because they're using a new
company that's doing this. It's just
texting and they're assessing like how
they respond and like you know the
communication all that stuff on text.
The next level up I think for tech for
the majority of our audience is going to
be SDRs. So like new grad um given the
unemployment numbers for new grads and
uh you know most companies aren't hiring
them but some are like why would you go
to campus and waste your resources that
way? Like it's such a crazy thing for a
company to do when instead you can just
institute more friction. And so an
example of this would be like yeah
submit your resume. In addition to that,
here is a link that takes you to a
one-way dynamic AI based interview and
it's going to be like 5 to 10 minutes.
And what we're going to assess there,
especially for like sales folks, is
their ability to communicate. Uh, you
know, how well uh how well they get
across their point, how succinctly get
across their point, those sorts of
things I think AI can handle today, but
nobody's doing it. I think the
contrarian thing about what you said is
probably not that this will happen, it's
probably that people will love it,
right? So, let's dive into that in a
second. Um, the only thing I would
disagree with what you just said there
though is AI is capable of doing it
today. Yes. But I think a lot of these
things, as with everything when you're
truly automating a human process, it's
like the last 2% that is the hardest and
actually people like get held back if it
can't complete that last 2%. And we're
hearing that a lot um where you know
actually
so many candidates that are spoken
you're getting way more way more like if
you just think of um the amount of video
media you're getting through your
recruiting process. What you're
describing is a situation where you get
way more video that someone or something
some form of intelligence has to review
right cuz right now it's a piece of
paper. you're saying we're going to be
some video and actually the amount of
times that the the clarity on what the
AI should recommend you do with this
candidate, it might only be some like
low double digit percentage of times
where they flag, hey, I'm not sure what
to do on this one. Someone should
review. But in absolute terms, it's
creating a lot more work for the people
because they have to then go and watch
that video and and and pass a judgment.
Um and so actually given you basically
yes you in a way you're increasing the
friction for the but you're you're
reducing the friction of like
essentially having to review a how many
conversations you have to review and so
people having to spend more time than
they were before reviewing videos. So
that's what we've heard so far. So I
think the question is can you get to the
point where the economics really do make
sense and the AI's
ability to conduct a high quality
interview or ask the right questions
dynamically and gauge and assess the
responses are such that you don't need
this like overinvestment in human in the
loop.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So totally agree and this is why I
think new grad specifically is like
where you start because there's going to
be a ton of inbound anyways. Also you
can like make more mistakes there.
they're also like more AI native so
they're going to be used to like the
experimentation in this topic but with
that process like I you know again if
you equate it to going on campus which
we used to do and it drove me crazy even
back in the you know 2015 2016 era of
like why are we going on on campus this
doesn't make any sense and so if you can
especially if companies are still doing
that which some are you can remove that
piece of the process and then basically
just skip the recruit recruiter screen
because AI in my mind is going to stack
rank these candidates and so you're
going to go to the first five like is
what's going to happen here and ideally
we're going to make a higher out of
that. So I do think it's going to
dramatically reduce the time spent from
recruiting and interview teams and make
it a better candidate experience. Um so
that's I think you're right that's
probably the most contrarian part is
like when people actually get hired from
inbound because right now the joke
amongst candidates is it's like it goes
into the black box. No one sees my
resume. Okay. What's number two for you?
&gt;&gt; Okay. I if that is your most contrarian
one, then I do actually have some
contrarian ones. And uh we're gonna
 
um Okay, where should we go? I will say
I'm going to flip up my order. We make
significant strides. Like the the sort
of the full version of this is the ATS
becomes invisible. And what I mean by
that is it's not my job to play with a
ATS. It's an AI agent's job to go and
fill that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in. Okay? And so I don't
interact with the ATS. my AI agents do.
Uh and so this idea, this uh sort of
almost sort of idea frankly that certain
members of the recruiting team live
inside this ATS and do all this work and
move this thing around here, change this
process, that's not like people are not
going to do that. You're going to spend
much more time out there in the world
actually doing the work as opposed to
sort of setting up the system to do the
work. And so I think increasingly um
yeah, the ATS becomes invisible is my uh
my second contrarian prediction. Okay.
So, I this is where I I hard disagree
this is happening in 2026. Like
&gt;&gt; we might be pushing it in 2026, but
we'll we'll we'll we'll see how far we
can get.
&gt;&gt; I see what you see. That's really
interesting. I hadn't thought about
that, but you're totally right of just
like how much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is just like
moving a candidate from stage to stage
when clearly like Metaview should be
listening during the uh the weekly sync
and then just do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] after and say
look good, look right. So like that
should happen, but there's still a lot
that's associated with that follow-up.
And so one one of mine that's upcoming
is I'll talk about this, but like say we
say, uh, okay, yeah, sle, we want to
move forward to an on-site interview.
It's not like, oh, automated like send
an email, like you got to get on the
phone, you got to build the
relationship.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But like that's that's where I
don't think you're removing that much
work.
&gt;&gt; It's I'm not saying I'm not saying that
is removing that much work to be honest.
I'm just saying that the it's just uh
it's um it's not the that's the work
about work, you know what I mean? So
people are going to do the work which is
calling the candidate and keeping them
warm and keeping them engaged and yeah,
I'm going to be, you know, obsessing
over my talk track for that and maybe
having that one extra minute with the
hiring manager to clarify what is what
does he or she think I should be, you
know, focusing on in that call. I'll do
that for sure. I just won't have to make
sure it's logged, you know, because
that's that's just
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like it. All right, that makes
sense. And I'm aligned like the work
about work is is dying for sure. And AI
is going to help kill it. Got
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
Hey everyone. So, if you haven't had a

from the world's best operators. Instead
of the same recycled opinions on
LinkedIn, you'll hear Nolan's signature
contrarian thinking and debate. Instead
of theory, you'll hear actionable
tactics and real metrics. Check out the

&gt;&gt; All right, I have a 2A and 2B.
So okay so 2A is 90% of sourcing will be
automated by the end of year 2026.
So I used to spend 20 to 40% of my week
literally just like looking for the
right candidate on LinkedIn. Like that
was a a huge chunk of my week. Obviously
like we've launched a tool like Metab's
tool on this is so gangster and this is
part of the reason like I have
conviction on this. I don't think I'm
ever going to go to zero. Like maybe I
can see it, but I still like I don't
know. Like this is probably like the
Whimo analogy of like if my Tesla or
Whimo can drive me everywhere, will I
never drive? Like I'm probably going to
drive sometimes. Um so I see like a huge
portion of that being automated by the
end of the year as AI and tech gets
better. Now 2B is outreach automation
will be an unmitigated disaster.
Okay? So everyone thinks sourcing and
outreach are the same thing and they're
not. They are entirely two different
things. Being able to find someone based
off of a spec that I got uh from a
hiring manager on LinkedIn is completely
different than getting that person to
get on a call with me. And I think the
amount of AI slop we are going to see
from outreach is going to reach
unprecedented levels. It's already bad.
I think it's going to get way worse in
 
Which means there is significant alpha
for intentional custom thoughtful
messages
to candidates. Love it. The reason I'm
just I'm trying to find a message from
someone who messaged me basically
similar a similar sort of thought. I
just want to be extremely frank with
you. I've spent tens of thousands of
dollars with company name company name
like sourcing company sourcing tool
names uh and other natural language
search tools. I don't know how you did
it. Seriously, you guys outeng
engineered the every single one of those
players. It's absurdly good. Uh the
future
um in the future the sourcer is
eliminated and you focus on elite
candidate experience with outreach and
follow-up. And the thing I thought was
really interesting about that is he
exactly what you described and I was
going to say this was sort of I learned
this through him's message actually. Uh
you know he he has them separate in his
mind. He sees his ability to do this
elite outreach. He's very AI forward. He
is very like cut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is going
to replace a lot of my work. He's not
like co he's he's not got it he's not
coping by saying hey outreach is like he
I'm not saying he's definitely right but
the fact is he in his head he's like no
one of the things I need to be really
great at is getting people on calls and
doing great outreach and that's actually
what I want to spend time focusing on
and Met is going to help me get there.
So he's like very very aligned with uh
very aligned with you. Um, I don't think
that, um, yeah, I basically agree like
we've seen this with the sales sales,
right, where these AI SDRs absolutely
sort of spam people to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you can
get some initial spike in people, but
you sort of scorch the earth and you can
ruin a reputation. I don't know. I
wonder whether we've I definitely know
Metiv has learned that learned a lesson
on that. Um so yeah but but I can
imagine people loving the idea you can
press one button and a million emails
get sent to people and almost uh you
know see where you go from there and
that would
&gt;&gt; everyone stage founder style every every
early stage founder who just raised
money who hasn't really built a team
before is going to be like oh my god I
can just press a button and it sources
and does the outreach on my behalf like
it sounds so good until you've actually
like been in the arena and doing that
and seeing how it pissed pisses people
off or even like being thoughtful about
your own inbox and how stupid the
outreach I get is it's so bad. So I
think it's going to get worse
&gt;&gt; and you guess and you'll get sample
you'll get um you'll get like a sort of
sample bias in the people who reply
right it's because if it is bad outreach
actually only maybe not the best
candidates reply and so you think oh
these are all this is all terrible so
you sort of like actually go into a bit
of a doom loop if it goes wrong
basically did you ever do like any form
of online dating
&gt;&gt; literally never I've never even seen an
online app I met my wife uh when I was
in high school
&gt;&gt; okay cool well I've heard uh that some
people when they did used to do this,
obviously you have like this sort of
swipe right, swipe left concept in some
of these apps and like there was some
people that would adopt the strategy of
well I'm just going to swipe right on
every single person. So basically I'm
going to say yes to every single person
that I come across on this dating app
and then I'll just wait to see who
replies and then from their reply I'll
decide whether I am indeed interested in
them. But like let me just get the pool
down to the people who I know are
interested. Uh, that's sort of what
could be the problem with outreach is if
you have a big button that says
basically swipe right on everyone on the
planet who matches this JD in the most
basic way and then go from there and you
just got this big cluster of uh of uh
fake matches as it were. Uh I can
imagine that happening. You're right.
&gt;&gt; But you nailed it on the selection bias,
right? Which is like I think actually
really good talent like they roll their
eyes at it and then I do in superhuman I
go command K Marcus bam and then like
never hear from you again.
&gt;&gt; So I don't know. I I do think there's an
aspect here which I didn't put in my
predictions, but has been coming up in
conversations with friends. We just
talked to John Bishki earlier this week
that that pod will launch soon. But but
John's prediction is like the
candidates's agent is going to talk to
the the company's agent
and I'm still like working like my brain
hasn't fully connected the synapses of
what that looks like. like I need to see
it in order to believe it, but I can
kind of squint and be like, yeah, like
for really good talent, like how good
you build your AI agent
may be like uh a signal in the hiring
process.
&gt;&gt; I I think it's inevitable, but it's it's
little by little, and it's one of those
things you'll look back on and in the
future and
it will sort of like slowly slowly
realize that actually things are
fundamentally shifted. I think a really,
as I've sort of hammered on a bunch of
times, it's obviously really good to
have an analogy of this as a human. Some
people have executive assistants and you
sort of sometimes you tag in your human
executive assistant to go and handle
certain emails with you, do the
scheduling, someone's got a question
about whatever my dietary requirements
before I go to this meeting. My EA knows
my dut so she'll she'll answer. And so,
you know, piece by piece, it's a all the
all the person on the other side wants
is the information so they can get on
and decide. And so I think you can get
into these very low stakes exchanges of
information and every human on the
planet will not have to spend time on
that low stake and then gradually you'll
just get these higher stakes more sort
of um specific uh things that you trust
the AI to do and but but I don't think
that's a 2026 holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look back on the
year and it's totally changed. I think
it's just like minor sort of changes. I
I actually think that that was one of my
I don't want to sort of spend too long
on it, but your point around the um
screening I think that's a really
interesting world for um essentially AI
avatars within the recruiting process or
a like personified AI agents is um maybe
it's not the screen because that's when
you're starting to develop the
relationship. Maybe it's some of the
other state. Maybe it's the in between.
Maybe it's, you know, um, when you sort
of have a question as a candidate during
the process and instead of waiting for
the recruiter to get back to you in 24
hours, you can just have like a high
bandwidth conversation with an AI and
that's that's totally bene that's like
totally win-win, right? Recruiter didn't
have to spend time managing their books
and answering those questions. Candidate
got the information they needed right
away. It's like not even debatable that
that's better. So I think that's might
be the areas that you get um it's not as
juicy a prize to be honest but it's it's
so beneficial to both parties and I
think that's really interesting. The
other thing I'd say is
if you see these companies like Sierra
AI or a lot of these um companies that
are helping you build other like more
customer support bots or even like even
these virtual SDRs,
they expect their customers to spend two
to four to six weeks maybe training that
avatar to be able to represent the brand
appropriately. I think that's probably
the pain, frankly, that some people
might have to go through is when they
turn up and say, "Great, let's get an
advertiser to do this thing without
appropriate training and context to do
it the way that you want. It will do it
worse than your team." Uh, and it will
do worse and at scale and but a much
larger scale. And so, there's like more
of the worst thing. So I think that's
what maybe hopefully people don't have
to touch the stove on that one and learn
that to the too much the hard way which
I think is why starting with some of the
like lower
lower less junior more junior roles as
it makes sense but I I still think
there's a risk there that you it's
really worth it to invest the time in
training these things and I think as an
industry we need to figure out what that
means. I also think it's just a great
experiment. You know what I mean? It's
like you're going to learn so much from
just like running that experiment that
like you're crazy if you're hiring new
guys and not doing it. think just the
amount of learning you and your team are
going to get from like opening up
Pandora's box on that I think is going
to be beneficial for everybody.
&gt;&gt; So the the the the prediction is uh
there will be a backlash against human
data extraction. Um what I mean by that
is there are these really like really
high growth companies and and the the
big foundational labs are sort of paying
for this that are essentially paying
people to uh do uh human like
reinforcement learning for the model. So
essentially like labeling data like hey
listen we're looking for an accountant
we're going to pay you tons of money
tons of dot money per hour to
essentially train our AI how to be an
accountant. And that's happening across
every job you can imagine. Um, and I
think they'll end up being a backlash
against this. I think some it's sort of
like a prisoners dilemma situation. Uh,
which is, hey, if we like give the AIS
all of our all of our sort of expertise,
then they'll do more and more of our
work. Um, now I think there's I
obviously am optimistic about this and
that will be a good thing because if the
machines can do it better than us, we
can focus on other things that machines
can't do and like that's the way things
are going to go. But I do think that
there will be some backlash and you like
whether that's like regulatory backlash
against extracting data like you know
paying people to give paying one
accountant to give the knowledge of all
the accountants on the planet to an AI
so that all those accountants no longer
can do that thing like there's an
interesting moral quandry there and I
think there'll be some form of backlash
either regulatory or just like in terms
of protests and this sort of thing.
Yeah. Okay. So, super interesting cuz
yes, I'm going to Vegas next week and I
was like looking up places to golf and
I'm like, you know, best places to go,
which I still Google search. Um, which,
you know, kind of makes me a boomer.
&gt;&gt; Anyways, the first website
&gt;&gt; is crushing it now, man. That's like
Gemini's Gemini,
&gt;&gt; right? So, maybe I'm maybe I'm back. Uh,
anyway, so I go in there and like I go
and try and copy and paste like it was
like the third car. I like Oh,
interesting. Copy and paste. It's like
you cannot copy on this website. And I
think the reason why is exactly what
you're saying is like the the author of
the website knows that AI is scraping
and they're like nope no longer you
can't. So I literally couldn't copy. I
had to go in and like type it in like
I've never screenshot it. The you got
character recognition. These AIs come
anyway. So anyways long. Okay. So so
that's where I agree with you. I
fundamentally disagree with the
prediction though because for people to
band together,
they have to like realize it's
happening. And I think they're they're
going to realize it's happening when
it's too late.
&gt;&gt; I I guess my prediction is people will
realize and like uh I think I'm I'm not
a I'm not a sort of a detractor of this
practice. Just to be clear, I'm just
saying I think these companies are
getting quite large and they're sort of
sitting a little bit under the radar.
They're not really telling the world
this is exactly what we do. Uh and
there's a reason for that and at some
point people are going to sort of the
truth will out you know.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So that's interesting. So I'll
give you uh I guess this is kind of
contrarian. Um my next one is very
related to that which is I think the
next era of social unrest comes from
white collar tech workers.
&gt;&gt; Social unrest. You think that you think
they got that in them?
 
&gt;&gt; Oh my god.
Well, um let me tell you yes and why. Uh
why is because
the salaries that tech companies have
given out historically
have recalibrated the expectations
of a gigantic populace
and now as companies have you know it's
not just AI right like so it's not
because of AI but it's like you know a
couple things right in 2022 obviously
like chat GBT came out and companies got
leaner Right? Both things were true.
Interest rates got higher. Companies
have like, you know, fewer headcount,
all that. Everyone knows, but there just
is objectively more leverage when you're
applying AI in the ways that we do every
day. And so, you don't need as many
people to do the same things. Now, will
companies have more or less heads? I
think it's objectively less. I've been
saying this for a couple years now, and
I think we're finally starting to see it
in the data. But what's gonna the second
order of that is is that you're going to
have this huge subset of people who have
added value to companies that no longer
and they can no longer add value in the
same way and they've been recalibrated
to these extremely high salaries.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And equity offers and benefits and all
this stuff and now they're going to feel
rug pulled. I don't I don't I can't
figure out where I think it's going to
if if that's going to be. So So
basically what is literally happening
most frequently now I would say is
people are um doing less
like graduate hiring and like you know
and literally if they're sort of like
having to sort of frankly like re re uh
maybe like cut a team cut part of a team
they tend to be keeping the more tenure
people. um which obviously has makes
sense in a bunch of ways because they're
more experienced in this but they are
like you can be an exception to this but
as as a rule they'll be less AI native
so I think there's this really
interesting like there's something also
interesting going on in terms of well
will the will the will the com go down
because it seems to be people are
concentrating on almost retaining and
keeping the most senior most highly paid
talent um and help hoping that they
figure out how to orchestrate the AI um
so that's that's I don't know it's not
happening now I guess is what I'm saying
Oh, okay. So, so my next prediction,
we'll talk about what you're talking
about, which by the way, Sil and I have
not shared predictions beforehand.
&gt;&gt; Um, but what I'm specifically saying is
is that headcount is shrinking at
companies. I'm not talking about comp. I
will talk I'll talk about comp later,
but with headcount shrinking, meaning
those people high earner high earners
historically now zero. And so when they
go back into the market and they're
looking for similar jobs and now because
like their skill set is no longer
valuable inside of tech companies, they
have to go to another segment of the
economy to where they're going to get
repriced to market in a very brutal way.
&gt;&gt; And you think it will cause you what
type of unrest do you have in mind?
&gt;&gt; I mean, we've already seen it. like
Mandami was just, you know, elected in
New York. And I think a big part of the
reason why is like these jobs are no
longer as they're they're not
proliferated in the same way as they
were for the last decade. They're so
much harder to get. And I think there's
like there is economic
frustration
and I think we're going to start to see
it manifest a lot more. So I think
you're going to start to see like more
of those types of candidates um getting
elected. I think you're going to see um
people get really upset with like what
tech companies are doing in their
neighborhoods.
So like no, we're not going to give tax
breaks anymore for you to open an office
here because like it's a data center,
you know, you you employ 25 people and
you're going to take all of our power.
So I think those are the sorts of things
that we're going to start.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's I don't know if
you have this, but I'm sure you do like
in the US, but in some cases when you
have um like stateowned land that they
want to build um let's say apartments on
top of uh you you sometimes get a
scenario where you have you have as the
builder as the sort of the private
builder of that apartment block you have
to sort of commit some of it to a
library for the local you know part of
it has to be a school you have to also
like contribute to the school being
built or the library being built or
things like I wonder if we'll get like
end up with a lot of that on data
centers as well like okay you're going
to build data center this is for AI you
have to sort of like do this thing
that's for the general people's good um
or perceived to be for the general
people's good maybe maybe that will be
and that will only happen when people
force it obviously so you need the sort
of whether it's unrest or whether it's
just democracy and action I don't know
um but uh yeah interesting yeah what's
your next one um okay um I think we will
start to see the emergence of people of
job titles that are agent managers so
i.e you are a manager, you are on the
management track uh of like within
levelings within a company. You have no
human human forms of intelligence that
you manage. You purely have artificial
intelligence that you manage. Um I think
that's going to be a very like this is
the decade of agentic AI. Uh to get the
most out of it, you need to put embed it
into your organization and orchestrate
it. And there are some people who are
better at that than others. And those
people are going to be agent managers.
It's going to be a high status
management role. I like it. And you
know, if we just go back to sourcing,
right, which was one of my predictions
earlier, I could totally see one person
in charge of agentic sourcing, right?
Cuz like you got to calibrate the agent.
Uh you got to make sure that it's like
getting all the right inputs. Uh you got
to be searching for new software that's
uh or new agents rather that are that
are launching. And so you're kind of
like the you're kind of like the captain
of like one of those ships. I can
totally see that. I like that one. And
and like I just as like I mean if you
ask any people manager or any uh anyone
who has an opinion on people managers
like what's the number one most
important skill I think fighting it to
be number one would be like
communication. How good are you at
communicating? You know what separates
you might be a mid IC but you could be
an elite manager and the thing that make
you elite is communication. You could be
an elite IC and end up as a mid manager
because you're not great at that
communication. And it's very similar
with AI agents. like literally that
ability to understand where an agent has
gone wrong, communicate to it in frankly
a very like um uh usually quite a human
way but sort of it's almost like a new
emerging skill obviously how to
communicate to AI agents um and build up
sort of almost like what's akin to
rapport so you sort of get each other
over time. Um I just think that's going
to be a real real job and again some
people will be better than others. Um,
sourcing is a great example like I I
imagine a world of one of the thing
that's lacking in a lot of Agentic
products at the moment including
MetaView to be to be fair um is
almost like Perf Perf review of these
agents like hey this agent is out there
sourcing for people like how many how
like has it found good ones or not and
like where's it going wrong and do I
need to get in there and coach you and
it's like hey you keep on getting this
wrong on this thing like let's add this
to your sort of bit of context so you
never get that wrong again. Okay, hit
you know and that is I that is literally
again the analogy with how you manage
humans is like very strong that is
literally what people do at the moment
we don't have enough of the almost a
heads up display and of course perf when
you do it with humans is terrible right
you talk to them like once every half a
year or something or this thing whereas
if you literally have like a fire hose
of insight you're getting about how this
agent performing all the time and we can
work out how to help visualize help you
visualize that and understand what to do
to improve how it's performing then you
know you can obviously make it super
effective So, I think that's gonna be a
really cool cool job of the future and I
think we'll start to see it this year.
&gt;&gt; That's really well said. I really like
that. That's super well said. And to be
more uh poignant on it, 2025 was the
year of just like agents. 2026, what
you're saying is it will be the year of
agent performance. Like, you're actually
going to get value from this thing. Uh
cuz like most agents in 2025 are dog
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And no one really says that.
They're like, "Oh my, they're all
they're all forward casting." I think I
think I I'd say they I think it's just
unpredictable. I think that's what I
think I think and your ability to
exercise control and make it so that
it's going to do a good job for you is
like is it's it's sort of like a little
bit whimsical like how do you figure it
out and sometimes it works.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with that. But
I still think there's like some pretty
magical things some of these agents have
done like you know obviously my team
uses coding agents like all the time
every day. Uh and it's not because it's
and they're not they're not dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
That's that's that's very very well said
which is like especially for like coding
is a great one. Even sourcing right now
with what you guys are doing is like
real value for the most part it's been
all hype. I think next year will be
about performance and substance.
&gt;&gt; There's one one thing that's quite
interesting right now um with we see it
in our data and even like I I I've I've
started sourcing a lot more since we
launched our agent because it's a much
more fluid way to do it. um is you sort
of can get sometimes
you might have like a you've been
working on this you've been having this
conversation with it to find people.
It's not going the way you want it to.
You just start a new one and sort of
start start again. That's like the best
the best way to sort of like is to just
sort of start again on it. So I think
it's interesting to think how is that is
that going to persist that you just
think [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it throw that away. I'm going
to start again like new almost like new
context window and let's let's start
again. or is do you start to almost
think of hey this agent who I've got
working on my AE searches I'm like
invested in making this a success and
like when it doesn't work out I'm going
to like address that and make it because
cuz it still has a lot of context that
you built up over time that you want to
maintain. Um so it's going to be
interesting to see how that that
literally like almost the analogy
develops over time. Yeah, I like it. All
right, my next one.
 
dollar offers for researchers.
 
things happen for non-technical talent.
So we've already seen like you know I
I'm I'm basically piggyback. I was
thinking about this and then the growth
by design news happened. So for those
that don't know Growth by Design was
acquired by Cursor, Aquaired whatever
happened. Uh I don't know how much. All
I know is that like I know Adam, love
Adam, for him to disrupt his lifestyle
that he had, which was dope to go work
at Cursor full-time had to have been
pretty lucrative. And so I think what's
go and that's like, you know, very
respectful, nothing but positive things
to say about that whole team, but like
really what happened there is like
they're acquiring Adam and Mike. And the
reason why they did that is because
there's no one else like those two guys
on the planet.
Now, those guys are not designing
anything that has to do with the LLM.
And I think you're going to start to see
that in other functions of like this
notion that uh oh well, this is like our
this is our cap on comp or like no,
you're going to start to see creative
again with the the very top of the food
chain. Kelly, uh, my podcast host on HR
Heretics, talks about back in the day at
Yahoo, they used to give away like Jeeps
as part of the sign on bonus, which when
I say it out loud sounds like from
another like it feels like Jurassic Park
of like that's like another world.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But I can see it happening again.
I really can because how do you get
people off the sideline to come do the
thing that they're
so uniquely good at and it's not just
build the model because the one thing is
building then we got to go sell it to
people then we got to go grow it then we
got to go build the rest of the team and
so when you start to think about it you
could start to see the the New York
Yankees are like making me throw up
right now the Los Angeles Dodgers
of tech companies and it's not just like
we need need a great pitcher and a
catcher. We need every We need elite at
every position on the field.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And those people have extreme agency
today and so how you going to rip them
out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I think you're going to start crazy
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think that's like the same theme
as my point on the VC talent partner
exodus to be honest. Um maybe know the
market sort of better and where where
those people are coming from, but yeah,
I think it's like the same same gist. Um
I think yes and I I but I it's it's
purely because I think the next two to
four years are just an absolute
race like we we are determining who the
sort of platform generational companies
of the future are over the next two to
four years and the prize is so big that
not having the best person in every
position to use like the the baseball
analogy is like it's not worth like you
might just don't take the risk like do
not take the risk. we've given you, you
know, a billion dollars. Like, frankly,
you know, you only need to break off a
little bit of that to to really change
some very talented people's lives. So,
yeah, I I I see that for sure. I I
wonder whether part of this is like um
 
like who is like actually
the
the real brains behind like a the
winning Formula 1 team, right? It's
obviously not the driver, right? The
driver is just the person who has to
like make sure this thing lives up to
its potential. This car that
&gt;&gt; other Red I know exactly who it's helmet
Marco Red Bull. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's like far smarter people
have put all this energy. I mean if you
obviously you think about and through
the fullness of time, you know, cars
never used to be a thing, right? They're
just these incredibly like these
inventors essentially who create these
amazing vehicles and they're just like
it's so but the highest paid person of
course is the driver because they're
like well we this we put so much effort
in now. We've invested so much in, you
know, building this machine in the case
of like AI that's like training this
model. We invested billions and billions
of billions. Can we really afford to
have a VP of sales who isn't like
absolutely the best we can have given
all of this this cost we've sunk into
it. And so I think you just that's one
thing that's one reason that drives
those really high I think um like like
comp for for non-technical people. Uh
and then the other thing I think is just
culture. I think like having a company
where everyone knows if you you end up
resenting the people who are getting
like so much money and if you're not if
there's not like some like bringing up
of everyone else as well if if there's
not like a rising tide for the other
people within that organization you can
also have a negative um negative
culture. I don't think that's like
driving it to be honest but I think it's
at least a it's a it it it will exist if
you don't sort of also compensate other
people really well.
&gt;&gt; That's really interesting to think about
it that way. Um, I would actually take
it a step further, which is, you know,
Netflix talked about this in like the
early 2000s of like we are building a
sports team. I I now think like that is
now widely shared amongst a number of
mega mega large companies. And when you
build a sports team, um, it's just
basically like you're performing or
you're not. And I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how
much money we paid you. We will execute
you in the middle of the night if you're
not meeting expectations.
I don't want to do that. But yeah,
they'll uh that's
&gt;&gt; what's that's what dude that Brandon
Aayuk like I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how much
money we gave you and and sunk cost
you know I talk about this all the time
with with my wife and my kids because I
feel like the best people on planet or
the best business people on planet earth
do not have sunk cost and so it's like I
don't
&gt;&gt; they don't have
cost.
&gt;&gt; So what I mean is is like we went and
spent a ton of money to get the absolute
best person. So that's my prediction.
And then the second part of the
prediction is going to be like we will
move on unbelievably quickly. We don't
have this like this sunk cost of like oh
well we gave them that money. Uh like no
like that's going away as well. Is like
nope we will rip you out and bring in
someone else because we know we can do
it now because now we're no longer
afraid to spend the money.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think uh obviously with the $100
million comp packages for the
researchers I think that was even I
don't know if it came from Zuck the line
but I think a lot of people in the
industry were were describing it in the
words of like percentage of like
percentage of market cap is like it's
negligible so like it would be
irresponsible not to have 10 of these
people 20und of these people there's
there's apparently only 150 I guess
that's interesting thing like the
researchers if you speak to if you
listen to um uh like the these AI
researchers, they'll basically tell you
there's like 150 to 200 people, everyone
knows their names within industry, like
who are the like the people that you
want who are going to like make the next
breakthrough or whatever it might be.
And so it's a very finite list. I I I
guess I wonder if it's as well
understood. That would be the thing that
holds it back. I think I don't think
it's as well understood who are like
literally what is the list of the best
people at these other things. I think
maybe it's more opinionated there. Um,
so maybe I don't think it'll go as far,
but I I I do I I can I definitely know
the stakes are high and when the stakes
are high, obviously you'll see that come
through in in comp.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Which is what's wrong.
&gt;&gt; You got any more?
&gt;&gt; I got one more. It's a it's more AI um
sort of specific than recruiting. But um
I think you'll really start to see the
foundation labs. So you know, OpenAI,
anthropic um obviously Google already do
this what I'm about to say, but Open AI
anthropic really move deeper into
applications. So you think about right
now OpenAI has one really popular on the
consumer side one popular application
chatgbt Sora is like emerging it's
getting more popular like that is their
game they're going to go like all in on
trying to build that consumer
application I don't know marketplace but
like sweet um and I think the sort of
the space for anthropic is to do that on
the business side. So I think it's going
be really interesting to see like what
parts of the business application layer
do they really start to like start to
play in. Um, so yeah, I think there'll
be like very significant moves into the
application layer by by those players.
&gt;&gt; You know, I've been hearing other people
say that and for whatever reason when
you
&gt;&gt; Nolan, that is a completely completely
novel
&gt;&gt; completely new thought.
&gt;&gt; But you had it from me. You only heard
it from me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What I was saying, what I was
about to say was it it finally that the
analogy clicked in my brain for Google.
Like Google, think about all the apps
now you have in your G Suite, right?
From Gmail to Docs to Sheets to
presentations.
For whatever reason, I I hadn't thought
about it the same way for LLMs. Like
people keep saying I'm like, "Okay,
yeah, like I heard about the Pulse
thing. Like, oh, it kind of seems like
kind of seems like a party trick right
now." But like obviously like by like no
no no they're going to build apps
because they have this one they have you
know two well they have one piece which
is the LLM which is unique to like them
and then the other piece is is they have
unique data on you because you're just
vomiting your entire life into this
thing all day long. And so like yeah my
imagination probably isn't good enough
to think about like what apps are going
to be the killer. That's why I'm not a
product person turns out. Uh, but
obviously like if Google did it for the
G Suite and it's like part of my
everyday. I'm looking at my Google doc
right now.
&gt;&gt; Google hasn't done great in enterprise
overall, but like Gmail is is like
pretty
&gt;&gt; huge business.
&gt;&gt; It's Google is a huge business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, but uh really what that was
was the technology advancement there was
before that point you wouldn't have
email in your browser. It was just they
had like managed to like render and
manage your inbox using JavaScript on
the browser. It's very similar to Figma
like actually doing all this very
intensive work in the browser was like
the the innovation there. Um but sort of
from a form factor perspective it was
the same. So I was um some people talk
about Gmail almost like an invention.
It's like well it looks very similar to
what it used to be. It's just on the
browser. So I don't know about that but
whatever the point is that was what was
the sort of exciting thing was there. I
just the difference with AI and the
reason it's riskier is because I would
expect them to take a very different
approach to the application. I wouldn't
expect it to be hey we've now done a
version of that. I guess chap has done
it with the open have done it with the
browser and it looks like roughly
similar to other browsers although with
some obviously cool features but I just
wonder whether it's more going to be
baked into the interaction you have with
the AI um and like a little again a
little bit more invisible right like hey
if I'm having this conversation with
Claude and clearly the output is I'm
going to email one of my team do I just
fire like how do I just instruct the
agent to go and do it and I again it's a
little bit invisible but the point is
that is now my application for emailing
my team. It's just it handles it for me
and puts it in front of me and this sort
of thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like watching Slack channels and
watching emails like making
recommendations to you on how it can
help. Like I I I I can start to imagine
some of those things, but like where it
goes, I mean, it's I think it is going
to be wild in 26. That's all I got. S So
So if you're listening to this, you've
made it this far. First of all,
unbelievable.
 
Second of all, it's the longest episode
we've ever done. Um, second of all,
please disagree with us. Like I would
love to hear where people uh agree or
not agree. And then the next piece is
like what do what are we missing? What
do you guys think is going to happen in
 
interested in hearing is like all right,
we all got different opinions on where
the world is going. We're in the middle
of a platform shift right now, which is
the biggest in humanity. Um, so I want
to hear what you guys have to think, but
honestly, Sy, what a 2025, man. What a
blast.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great year. Best year of my life.
Wow. Me, too. I love it. All right,
guys. We'll talk to you soon.
