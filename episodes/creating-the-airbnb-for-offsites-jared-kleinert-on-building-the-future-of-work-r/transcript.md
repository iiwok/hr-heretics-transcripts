So off-site is part end-to-end off-site
 
So off-site is part end-to-end off-site
planning service business, part Airbnb
 
planning service business, part Airbnb
for team retreats. And so ultimately,
 
for team retreats. And so ultimately,
we're building like
 
we're building like
the defining platform to plan any sort
 
the defining platform to plan any sort
of team retreat. Day one it was a a
 
of team retreat. Day one it was a a
service business and to date we've now
 
service business and to date we've now
planned hundreds of offsites all over
 
planned hundreds of offsites all over
the globe for remote and buffer and 155
 
the globe for remote and buffer and 155
and web flow and linear and
 
and web flow and linear and
HubSpot but ultimately we're we're
 
HubSpot but ultimately we're we're
trying to build the category defining
 
trying to build the category defining
tech company here and kind of automate
 
tech company here and kind of automate
away as much of the planning process as
 
away as much of the planning process as
possible give you a marketplace that you
 
possible give you a marketplace that you
could save lots of time money and stress
 
could save lots of time money and stress
in and yeah today we have a marketplace
 
in and yeah today we have a marketplace
that generates tens of millions of GMV
 
that generates tens of millions of GMV
and like an additional Hundreds of
 
and like an additional Hundreds of
offsets are being booked through it and
 
offsets are being booked through it and
we partner with thousands of hotels and
 
we partner with thousands of hotels and
other vendors as well, but we're also,
 
other vendors as well, but we're also,
you know, continuing to build out that
 
you know, continuing to build out that
product
 
product
and yeah, full full transparency.
 
and yeah, full full transparency.
Kelly's an angel investor of ours, so
 
Kelly's an angel investor of ours, so
she gets the, you know, monthly updates
 
she gets the, you know, monthly updates
and sees our progress. And it's
 
and sees our progress. And it's
definitely been an amazing journey, but
 
definitely been an amazing journey, but
I also feel like we're still very early
 
I also feel like we're still very early
in our vision for what we're building.
 
in our vision for what we're building.
Yeah, I I am an investor, Nolan. It's I
 
Yeah, I I am an investor, Nolan. It's I
think it's such a cool concept and
 
think it's such a cool concept and
business
 
business
model and excited to talk about the
 
model and excited to talk about the
journey and how it's how it's going now
 
journey and how it's how it's going now
especially when you know a lot more
 
especially when you know a lot more
companies are going back to the office
 
companies are going back to the office
Jared and all of that. Have you have you
 
Jared and all of that. Have you have you
seen any shifts there in terms of demand
 
seen any shifts there in terms of demand
or customer profile or have you shifted
 
or customer profile or have you shifted
offsite any? No, I actually think I'm
 
offsite any? No, I actually think I'm
I'm surprised this is still a
 
I'm surprised this is still a
conversation to be totally frank. Like I
 
conversation to be totally frank. Like I
started off-site during the pandemic. My
 
started off-site during the pandemic. My
bets were that more companies would go
 
bets were that more companies would go
fully remote, distributed hybrid because
 
fully remote, distributed hybrid because
I saw that the decade leading into the
 
I saw that the decade leading into the
pandemic, we went from barely having any
 
pandemic, we went from barely having any
companies working remotely to 10% of
 
companies working remotely to 10% of
knowledge working companies working
 
knowledge working companies working
remotely or or hybrid. And so I saw that
 
remotely or or hybrid. And so I saw that
trend. I I thought it would continue and
 
trend. I I thought it would continue and
that co would push us a decade into the
 
that co would push us a decade into the
future. I was right on that front.
 
future. I was right on that front.
I thought that if that were to occur
 
I thought that if that were to occur
that a lot of companies would plan
 
that a lot of companies would plan
off-sights because all the pioneering
 
off-sights because all the pioneering
remote companies like 155, automatic,
 
remote companies like 155, automatic,
GitLab, Atlassian, etc. plan lots of
 
GitLab, Atlassian, etc. plan lots of
retreats as sort of an inescapable part
 
retreats as sort of an inescapable part
of employee engagement or retention
 
of employee engagement or retention
alignment. And I knew from previous
 
alignment. And I knew from previous
experience that planning off-site sucked
 
experience that planning off-site sucked
because I planned probably like 14 or 15
 
because I planned probably like 14 or 15
conferences of 20 to 100 people pre-
 
conferences of 20 to 100 people pre-
pandemic for a previous business that I
 
pandemic for a previous business that I
had.
 
had.
And so I was right on a lot of those
 
And so I was right on a lot of those
fronts. I thought that everyone would
 
fronts. I thought that everyone would
just accept that remote work is awesome
 
just accept that remote work is awesome
and that distributed work is great, but
 
and that distributed work is great, but
then you have people like Elon Musk and
 
then you have people like Elon Musk and
like the government just like making the
 
like the government just like making the
debate persistent and it's actually
 
debate persistent and it's actually
really good for us because then I can go
 
really good for us because then I can go
on LinkedIn and just like talk about the
 
on LinkedIn and just like talk about the
debate as opposed to talking about other
 
debate as opposed to talking about other
stuff. And so I do see the headlines and
 
stuff. And so I do see the headlines and
there are a small percentage of Fortune
 
there are a small percentage of Fortune
 
but I think it's a very small part of a
 
but I think it's a very small part of a
reversion to prepandemic whereas like
 
reversion to prepandemic whereas like
the macro trend is still very much
 
the macro trend is still very much
remote work, hybrid work, distributed
 
remote work, hybrid work, distributed
work in my opinion that I that debate
 
work in my opinion that I that debate
has been had like a million times and I
 
has been had like a million times and I
think Kelly and I are like going to jump
 
think Kelly and I are like going to jump
off my balcony together if we have it
 
off my balcony together if we have it
again. But what I Yeah. Yeah, I do right
 
again. But what I Yeah. Yeah, I do right
here. It's It might not be high enough,
 
here. It's It might not be high enough,
but maybe we'll find out if we keep
 
but maybe we'll find out if we keep
talking about this. Okay, Jared, I want
 
talking about this. Okay, Jared, I want
to talk about what makes a good offsite
 
to talk about what makes a good offsite
and what makes a shitty offsite. So, you
 
and what makes a shitty offsite. So, you
probably have the widest aperture of
 
probably have the widest aperture of
anybody I know. So, walk us through like
 
anybody I know. So, walk us through like
let's start with actually like the
 
let's start with actually like the
success case. People walking away being
 
success case. People walking away being
like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was the most
 
like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was the most
magical event I've ever been to." What
 
magical event I've ever been to." What
are the required ingredients that go
 
are the required ingredients that go
into that? I think the logistics are
 
into that? I think the logistics are
kind of the bottom layer of Mazo's
 
kind of the bottom layer of Mazo's
hierarchy of needs. So, you do need
 
hierarchy of needs. So, you do need
people to arrive safely and, you know,
 
people to arrive safely and, you know,
have food, have shelter, all those fun
 
have food, have shelter, all those fun
things. I think they're the least
 
things. I think they're the least
important ingredients of what makes a
 
important ingredients of what makes a
super high ROI offsite. And they're
 
super high ROI offsite. And they're
they're what I'm personally least
 
they're what I'm personally least
passionate about. When I was at 155, I
 
passionate about. When I was at 155, I
was very fortunate to work with, you
 
was very fortunate to work with, you
know, two of the co-founders there. and
 
know, two of the co-founders there. and
they are have some of the widest
 
they are have some of the widest
apertures of like personal and
 
apertures of like personal and
professional development of people that
 
professional development of people that
I know and really thinking
 
I know and really thinking
about one's zone of genius and like
 
about one's zone of genius and like
bringing your best self to work and
 
bringing your best self to work and
thinking about how to create exceptional
 
thinking about how to create exceptional
company culture because that their tool
 
company culture because that their tool
helps other companies do that and like
 
helps other companies do that and like
they have built award-winning culture
 
they have built award-winning culture
themselves and so when I was at off
 
themselves and so when I was at off
sites with them in the early days when I
 
sites with them in the early days when I
was a teenager and like as one of the
 
was a teenager and like as one of the
first employees
 
first employees
We were doing things like working
 
We were doing things like working
through our mission, vision, values as a
 
through our mission, vision, values as a
company. We were doing strategic
 
company. We were doing strategic
planning sessions for the upcoming
 
planning sessions for the upcoming
quarter. We were doing things to break
 
quarter. We were doing things to break
down silos in between different
 
down silos in between different
departments and increase cross
 
departments and increase cross
department collaboration. So, I think
 
department collaboration. So, I think
the highest ROI offsets that I see with
 
the highest ROI offsets that I see with
our clients and hear from other CEOs are
 
our clients and hear from other CEOs are
when whoever's planning the offsite
 
when whoever's planning the offsite
starts with a very clear picture of what
 
starts with a very clear picture of what
the objective is for the offsite. And
 
the objective is for the offsite. And
that's going to be different for any
 
that's going to be different for any
team or company that meets. It could be
 
team or company that meets. It could be
different throughout the year.
 
different throughout the year.
And it really needs to be thought
 
And it really needs to be thought
through intentionally because your goals
 
through intentionally because your goals
for an all hands meeting or having
 
for an all hands meeting or having
everyone at the company attend an off
 
everyone at the company attend an off
day is going to be different than an
 
day is going to be different than an
executive team retreat, then a sales
 
executive team retreat, then a sales
kickoff, things like that. But I think
 
kickoff, things like that. But I think
more like the best companies will spend
 
more like the best companies will spend
lots of time being very intentional
 
lots of time being very intentional
about what they want to accomplish and
 
about what they want to accomplish and
then go into actually planning the
 
then go into actually planning the
offsite. And I I wish more people did
 
offsite. And I I wish more people did
that. You more most people are like,
 
that. You more most people are like,
"Oh, shoot. We need to plan an offsite."
 
"Oh, shoot. We need to plan an offsite."
And then they're like, "Where do we have
 
And then they're like, "Where do we have
it?" And then they kind of stumble into
 
it?" And then they kind of stumble into
a location and you know into some dates
 
a location and you know into some dates
that work for a Q key executives but and
 
that work for a Q key executives but and
then they like get halfway through
 
then they like get halfway through
planning it with some of the major
 
planning it with some of the major
logistics and then they start thinking
 
logistics and then they start thinking
about what are we actually going to talk
 
about what are we actually going to talk
about there
 
about there
versus you know we are doing this sales
 
versus you know we are doing this sales
kickoff because we have these really
 
kickoff because we have these really
ambitious sales goals and yet no one on
 
ambitious sales goals and yet no one on
our team knows the new product that
 
our team knows the new product that
we're trying to sell and we need to like
 
we're trying to sell and we need to like
do training and hype the team up and
 
do training and hype the team up and
paint a picture of how we can raise our
 
paint a picture of how we can raise our
series C if and when we're successful
 
series C if and when we're successful
like you know something like that and so
 
like you know something like that and so
hopey that starts to answer your
 
hopey that starts to answer your
question no Owen well the the fail state
 
question no Owen well the the fail state
on it's interesting you mentioned the
 
on it's interesting you mentioned the
Maslo's hierarchy to start it off
 
Maslo's hierarchy to start it off
because the first thing that went
 
because the first thing that went
through my mind was like the fire
 
through my mind was like the fire
festival
 
festival
I don't even think about like logistics
 
I don't even think about like logistics
are important for sure well it's funny
 
are important for sure well it's funny
because like I've never even considered
 
because like I've never even considered
I'm like yeah like we like when I ran
 
I'm like yeah like we like when I ran
off sites at teams like we're only
 
off sites at teams like we're only
picking places in the
 
picking places in the
you know, you like get it. It's like not
 
you know, you like get it. It's like not
that hard. But actually, some of my
 
that hard. But actually, some of my
friends have done some of these like
 
friends have done some of these like
like more, you know, journey vacations
 
like more, you know, journey vacations
kind of thing and going like deep into
 
kind of thing and going like deep into
Mexico and places I've never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
Mexico and places I've never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
heard of. And it never dawned on me that
 
heard of. And it never dawned on me that
like actually that can lead to a lot of
 
like actually that can lead to a lot of
second order problems which completely
 
second order problems which completely
corrupt the entire like mission of the
 
corrupt the entire like mission of the
offsite. Yeah. I mean, if someone gets
 
offsite. Yeah. I mean, if someone gets
sick halfway through the offsite and
 
sick halfway through the offsite and
like can't attend key sessions, then
 
like can't attend key sessions, then
you're going to lose a lot of value.
 
you're going to lose a lot of value.
Yeah. Or if you pick the wrong dates and
 
Yeah. Or if you pick the wrong dates and
suddenly, you know, like key folks can't
 
suddenly, you know, like key folks can't
attend, that's going to cause issues.
 
attend, that's going to cause issues.
So, you do have to think through these
 
So, you do have to think through these
things. And, you know, you you probably
 
things. And, you know, you you probably
want to have a location that's centrally
 
want to have a location that's centrally
located to where all your attendees are.
 
located to where all your attendees are.
You probably want it to be in line with
 
You probably want it to be in line with
what your objectives are. Like do you
 
what your objectives are. Like do you
want people to be very creative and have
 
want people to be very creative and have
like room to brainstorm for like a
 
like room to brainstorm for like a
marketing team retreat? Maybe you put
 
marketing team retreat? Maybe you put
them in a location that is very
 
them in a location that is very
inspiring and like away from a city or
 
inspiring and like away from a city or
do you need clients to have access to
 
do you need clients to have access to
your
 
your
off-site and or maybe it's a customer
 
off-site and or maybe it's a customer
conference like maybe you need to be in
 
conference like maybe you need to be in
New York or in San Francisco or
 
New York or in San Francisco or
something like
 
something like
that. I don't know like I can I can
 
that. I don't know like I can I can
pontificate but you know you got to give
 
pontificate but you know you got to give
people healthy foods that their brain is
 
people healthy foods that their brain is
functioning and so on and so forth.
 
functioning and so on and so forth.
We've gotten a couple questions actually
 
We've gotten a couple questions actually
from listeners, Nolan. One of these was
 
from listeners, Nolan. One of these was
a dear heretic question. You know what I
 
a dear heretic question. You know what I
mean? On to your point, Jared, like off
 
mean? On to your point, Jared, like off
sites can become this black hole of
 
sites can become this black hole of
like, you know, whoever has the time to
 
like, you know, whoever has the time to
bubble gum and tape something together
 
bubble gum and tape something together
before you get there. And it's just it's
 
before you get there. And it's just it's
it's a hit or miss, you know, and it's
 
it's a hit or miss, you know, and it's
very inconsistent. Like I'm just
 
very inconsistent. Like I'm just
wondering if this fits within your what
 
wondering if this fits within your what
what you all do at offsite is what are
 
what you all do at offsite is what are
the metrics you know what how are you
 
the metrics you know what how are you
helping folks
 
helping folks
measure such a qualitative like
 
measure such a qualitative like
ambiguous thing if if you even have
 
ambiguous thing if if you even have
tried to tackle that. I want to spend
 
tried to tackle that. I want to spend
more
 
more
time trying to sell people on like the
 
time trying to sell people on like the
qualitative benefits of it. We found
 
qualitative benefits of it. We found
that the easiest way to start the
 
that the easiest way to start the
company was to work with people that
 
company was to work with people that
already got it and then show how we're
 
already got it and then show how we're
saving time, money, and stress in the
 
saving time, money, and stress in the
off-site planning process. So, you know,
 
off-site planning process. So, you know,
if you have a company that's already
 
if you have a company that's already
planning an off-site, like they've
 
planning an off-site, like they've
budgeted for it, we're like, "Okay,
 
budgeted for it, we're like, "Okay,
we'll save you, you know, up to 50% on
 
we'll save you, you know, up to 50% on
your room block or meeting space. We'll
 
your room block or meeting space. We'll
save you money on food and
 
save you money on food and
beverage. We'll save you 50 to 100 hours
 
beverage. We'll save you 50 to 100 hours
of your planning time." And then you
 
of your planning time." And then you
know that saves you like thousands or
 
know that saves you like thousands or
tens of thousands of dollars in salary
 
tens of thousands of dollars in salary
and like opportunity costs and and a lot
 
and like opportunity costs and and a lot
of people have like got it that way. We
 
of people have like got it that way. We
then try and explain, you know, if
 
then try and explain, you know, if
you're increasing employee
 
you're increasing employee
engagement, maybe you have people that
 
engagement, maybe you have people that
say an extra six months or a year on
 
say an extra six months or a year on
average and like what are the benefits
 
average and like what are the benefits
of that and like what would it cost to
 
of that and like what would it cost to
replace those employees? And then even
 
replace those employees? And then even
if you keep people, are they engaged?
 
if you keep people, are they engaged?
And so that's where you it starts to
 
And so that's where you it starts to
become more and more qualitative is like
 
become more and more qualitative is like
kind of what's the value of more engaged
 
kind of what's the value of more engaged
employees, more aligned employees,
 
employees, more aligned employees,
greater trust and intimacy on your team
 
greater trust and intimacy on your team
versus less. I'm sure you could start to
 
versus less. I'm sure you could start to
chip away at that with, you know, your
 
chip away at that with, you know, your
Lattis or 155 or Culture AMP reports. We
 
Lattis or 155 or Culture AMP reports. We
do encourage our clients to do like pre
 
do encourage our clients to do like pre
and post offsite feedback forms where
 
and post offsite feedback forms where
they can ask things like an employer net
 
they can ask things like an employer net
promoter score or like a connectedness
 
promoter score or like a connectedness
to colleague score or like connectedness
 
to colleague score or like connectedness
to the company mission, vision,
 
to the company mission, vision,
values, but every company's going to be
 
values, but every company's going to be
a little different in how they do that.
 
a little different in how they do that.
And you could also, you know, if if it
 
And you could also, you know, if if it
is more of a specific team retreat, like
 
is more of a specific team retreat, like
an executive team retreat or a marketing
 
an executive team retreat or a marketing
team retreat or product engineering,
 
team retreat or product engineering,
maybe there's specific initiatives that
 
maybe there's specific initiatives that
come out of that offsite and then you
 
come out of that offsite and then you
could point back and say, you know, when
 
could point back and say, you know, when
we did it that offsite, that was the
 
we did it that offsite, that was the
point in time at which things really
 
point in time at which things really
change for
 
change for
us. A specific example for us is like
 
us. A specific example for us is like
every CEO and their mom is thinking
 
every CEO and their mom is thinking
about how to get companies to use AI
 
about how to get companies to use AI
more. And
 
more. And
so I did the same thing at our first
 
so I did the same thing at our first
week of February off-site. I did this
 
week of February off-site. I did this
presentation to the company. I'm like,
 
presentation to the company. I'm like,
"Hey, we all got to, you know, use AI
 
"Hey, we all got to, you know, use AI
more and if we do it with our
 
more and if we do it with our
marketplace, I think here's all the
 
marketplace, I think here's all the
benefits." I laid out this structure
 
benefits." I laid out this structure
called OA or optimize, operationalize,
 
called OA or optimize, operationalize,
and automate. And it's sort of like the
 
and automate. And it's sort of like the
building blocks for AI. But there's like
 
building blocks for AI. But there's like
a very clear before and after at our
 
a very clear before and after at our
company of before that presentation and
 
company of before that presentation and
before the off-site some people were
 
before the off-site some people were
tinkering with AI and now we went
 
tinkering with AI and now we went
through like 45 days of tinkering and
 
through like 45 days of tinkering and
experimentation and now we're into like
 
experimentation and now we're into like
the expectation phase of our business
 
the expectation phase of our business
where everyone's expected to use these
 
where everyone's expected to use these
tools and learn how to leverage them.
 
tools and learn how to leverage them.
And so that's definitely subjective and
 
And so that's definitely subjective and
qualitative but really valuable from my
 
qualitative but really valuable from my
perspective. I'm glad you brought you
 
perspective. I'm glad you brought you
brought that up and you said, you know,
 
brought that up and you said, you know,
we kind of accent on qualitative as well
 
we kind of accent on qualitative as well
and kind of work with folks that get it.
 
and kind of work with folks that get it.
And I'd love to maybe hear from both of
 
And I'd love to maybe hear from both of
you, but like I've been saying for a
 
you, but like I've been saying for a
while like not everything great has a
 
while like not everything great has a
number and sometimes things are just
 
number and sometimes things are just
they're just good. Like do you think
 
they're just good. Like do you think
that's changed a little bit? Cuz I
 
that's changed a little bit? Cuz I
remember remember the days of the
 
remember remember the days of the
obsessive you got to measure everything
 
obsessive you got to measure everything
and everything is quantitative and you
 
and everything is quantitative and you
know especially those in HR got hit hard
 
know especially those in HR got hit hard
like you must make everything
 
like you must make everything
quantitative and sometimes you just
 
quantitative and sometimes you just
can't. I mean for us we I
 
can't. I mean for us we I
think a lot of our clients are
 
think a lot of our clients are
venture-back tech startups
 
venture-back tech startups
and in 2022 2023 we we had basically our
 
and in 2022 2023 we we had basically our

meeting their colleagues in person. Like

at the end of the day, we are human
 
at the end of the day, we are human
beings. And until we are part robot,
 
beings. And until we are part robot,
which might be pretty soon, but until
 
which might be pretty soon, but until
that happens, we're going to be
 
that happens, we're going to be
creatures that desire to connect with
 
creatures that desire to connect with

easier than ever
to quiet quit and just like do the bare
 
to quiet quit and just like do the bare
minimum at home. And so, yeah, I it is
 
minimum at home. And so, yeah, I it is
hard to quantify, but people have seen
 
hard to quantify, but people have seen
the cost of not doing off-sites and then
 
the cost of not doing off-sites and then
they always revert back to like we need
 
they always revert back to like we need
to get people together in person at
 
to get people together in person at
least once a year. And then kind of the
 
least once a year. And then kind of the
the most forward thinking
 
the most forward thinking
companies like your your pioneering

post-pandemic remote and flexible work.
You know, here's a framework you can
 
You know, here's a framework you can
model after. And it basically was a
 
model after. And it basically was a
framework where every employee of those
 
framework where every employee of those
kind of companies were going to two to
 
kind of companies were going to two to
four off-sightes a year and a mix of
 
four off-sightes a year and a mix of
like larger ones and more intimate ones
 
like larger ones and more intimate ones
based on your team. Some were just on
 
based on your team. Some were just on
your team, some were more cross
 
your team, some were more cross
department or like project based. And so
 
department or like project based. And so
every company is trying to figure out
 
every company is trying to figure out
their own cadence of offsites, but the
 
their own cadence of offsites, but the
conversation has moved from is this a
 
conversation has moved from is this a
nice to have or must have to we have to
 
nice to have or must have to we have to

gather in person and how are we going to
do it most cost-effectively with the
 
do it most cost-effectively with the
highest ROI with the best outcomes from

giving us the opportunity to have like
 
giving us the opportunity to have like

Kelly, as I was just like imagining it
 
Kelly, as I was just like imagining it
in my head is
 
in my head is
like, you know, you have an offsite on a
 
like, you know, you have an offsite on a
date, but we never actually like put
 
date, but we never actually like put
that date on like the revenue chart,
 
that date on like the revenue chart,
right? And I can imag like on a good
 
right? And I can imag like on a good
offsite, right, the revenue chart goes
 
offsite, right, the revenue chart goes
up. On a shitty off-site, it like stays
 
up. On a shitty off-site, it like stays
flat or goes down. Goes down, right?

Yeah. So I think there's like actually

offsites and like what do they do like
walk like more into that like so for
 
walk like more into that like so for
sure they're working

backwards but you know if I think about
 
backwards but you know if I think about
if I tell you my goal is and let's start
 
if I tell you my goal is and let's start
with companywide first and then I
 
with companywide first and then I
actually want to talk about exact
 
actually want to talk about exact
offsites too but company or maybe team
 
offsites too but company or maybe team
offsites and exact offsites, but
 
offsites and exact offsites, but
companywide offsite, right? You know,
 
companywide offsite, right? You know,
we're getting everybody together
 
we're getting everybody together
together. I don't care if it's like
 
together. I don't care if it's like
remote or in person, but like for
 
remote or in person, but like for
whatever reason, we've decided this is
 
whatever reason, we've decided this is
what we want to do. Maybe it's like a
 
what we want to do. Maybe it's like a
sales kickoff situation. And, you know,
 
sales kickoff situation. And, you know,
we want people to like feel more
 
we want people to like feel more
connected to like, you know, be ready to
 
connected to like, you know, be ready to
like, you know, jump through all of the
 
like, you know, jump through all of the
different hoops we're going to put in
 
different hoops we're going to put in
front of them for to hit these goals. We
 
front of them for to hit these goals. We
want them to like bleed company blue,
 
want them to like bleed company blue,
whatever company color it is, and like,
 
whatever company color it is, and like,
you know, we do the kumbaya and do the
 
you know, we do the kumbaya and do the
blood brothers thing at the end of it.
 
blood brothers thing at the end of it.
What do I need to do to make sure that
 
What do I need to do to make sure that
that happens and blood sisters?
 
that happens and blood sisters?
One is be inclusive. You're cancelled.
 
One is be inclusive. You're cancelled.
No. No, I'm just kidding. You're the
 
No. No, I'm just kidding. You're the
 
You're late.
 
Yeah, I do think it's going to be
 
Yeah, I do think it's going to be
different for every company, but there
 
different for every company, but there
are some building
 
are some building
blocks. And so if if we do start with
 
blocks. And so if if we do start with
the logistics, it's making sure that
 
the logistics, it's making sure that
you find a a location that is centrally
 
you find a a location that is centrally
located enough where you don't have
 
located enough where you don't have
these exhaustive like travel in and
 
these exhaustive like travel in and
travel out scenarios. For the people
 
travel out scenarios. For the people
that do have to travel the farthest,
 
that do have to travel the farthest,
maybe giving them the opportunity to fly
 
maybe giving them the opportunity to fly
in earlier like and invest at an extra
 
in earlier like and invest at an extra
hotel night for them so they can come in
 
hotel night for them so they can come in
rested. It's allowing enough travel in
 
rested. It's allowing enough travel in
and travel out time
 
and travel out time
because airlines are not as reliable as
 
because airlines are not as reliable as
they used to be
 
they used to be
and maybe you're going somewhere that
 
and maybe you're going somewhere that
you have to like land and then drive an
 
you have to like land and then drive an
hour, hour and a half to escape the
 
hour, hour and a half to escape the
city. So you have to allow like sort of
 
city. So you have to allow like sort of
time to come in and then people are
 
time to come in and then people are
going to be at varying levels of
 
going to be at varying levels of
excitement and extraversion like ready
 
excitement and extraversion like ready
to engage with others versus being
 
to engage with others versus being
anxious because they're more introverted
 
anxious because they're more introverted
and maybe haven't met met people or
 
and maybe haven't met met people or
they're leaving loved ones at home or
 
they're leaving loved ones at home or
you know other things like that. So
 
you know other things like that. So
letting them ease into the offsite is
 
letting them ease into the offsite is
always a good idea. And so our our first
 
always a good idea. And so our our first
days are almost always like travel
 
days are almost always like travel
in, maybe some optional activities in
 
in, maybe some optional activities in
the afternoon, but lots of flex time if
 
the afternoon, but lots of flex time if
people just want to check in and take a
 
people just want to check in and take a
nap or, you know, do some work before
 
nap or, you know, do some work before
they have to put their day-to-day work
 
they have to put their day-to-day work
away. And then some sort of like low
 
away. And then some sort of like low
stakes dinner, maybe a fun party, but
 
stakes dinner, maybe a fun party, but
nothing that goes on too late. And no
 
nothing that goes on too late. And no
work talk, you know? Let's just
 
work talk, you know? Let's just
decompress. Let's get to like mix and
 
decompress. Let's get to like mix and
mingle a little bit. Ease into this
 
mingle a little bit. Ease into this
offsite. Then you want to think about
 
offsite. Then you want to think about
starting each day maybe with some
 
starting each day maybe with some
optional workouts or yoga or like
 
optional workouts or yoga or like
something to get people in in the right
 
something to get people in in the right
state of mind and then like healthy food
 
state of mind and then like healthy food
options to also get them in the right
 
options to also get them in the right
state of mind. I like to do ice breakers
 
state of mind. I like to do ice breakers
at the beginning of each day for up to
 
at the beginning of each day for up to
 
have everyone permit to connecting with
 
have everyone permit to connecting with

Interesting. And so you could do ice
 
Interesting. And so you could do ice
breakers that re reveal like personal
 
breakers that re reveal like personal
information and like connect on on that
 
information and like connect on on that
sense. And it could be pretty innocent
 
sense. And it could be pretty innocent
like you know pair up and show us a
 
like you know pair up and show us a
photo of a loved one on your phone and
 
photo of a loved one on your phone and
like explain the photo and like maybe
 
like explain the photo and like maybe
someone pulls up a photo of their family
 
someone pulls up a photo of their family
or like their dog and like suddenly you
 
or like their dog and like suddenly you
get to see people in a whole different
 
get to see people in a whole different
light or you know you could do things

also do professional ice breakers like
 
also do professional ice breakers like
what's
 
what's
your biggest highlight of working at the
 
your biggest highlight of working at the
company so far and kind of bring out

different positive emotions there. So
 
different positive emotions there. So
you can do that short and sweet just
 
you can do that short and sweet just
like get everyone in a good state of
 
like get everyone in a good state of

you're going to have like your CEO or or
 
you're going to have like your CEO or or

the offsite is probably the way to go.
 
the offsite is probably the way to go.
Sometimes people try and cram too many
 
Sometimes people try and cram too many
sessions into the offsite and instead we
 
sessions into the offsite and instead we
find that really thinking through the
 
find that really thinking through the
agenda and only including things that
 
agenda and only including things that
can't happen over Zoom or can't be in an
 
can't happen over Zoom or can't be in an

department. Those are probably the
things you should be doing in an
 
things you should be doing in an
off-site. Not having endless
 
off-site. Not having endless
presentations from like one person to a
 
presentations from like one person to a
crowd with some slides or you know even
 
crowd with some slides or you know even
doing like retros of previous quarters
 
doing like retros of previous quarters
or years like that could be done
 
or years like that could be done
virtually. And so you know thinking
 
virtually. And so you know thinking
through like what are the important
 
through like what are the important
things you want to do leaving lots of
 
things you want to do leaving lots of
flex time in between sessions so that if
 
flex time in between sessions so that if
you're running over you don't have to
 
you're running over you don't have to
like cut an important conversation short
 
like cut an important conversation short
or if sales team has to like take a
 
or if sales team has to like take a
sales call they can do that.
 
sales call they can do that.
And then, you know, making sure each day
 
And then, you know, making sure each day
ends on a high note. So, having like a
 
ends on a high note. So, having like a
party or like some really fun
 
party or like some really fun
activities, making sure the overall
 
activities, making sure the overall
offsite ends on a high note so people
 
offsite ends on a high note so people
look back fondly on the
 
look back fondly on the
experience. And yeah, depending on the
 
experience. And yeah, depending on the
company, then you can insert your sort
 
company, then you can insert your sort
of levels of shenanigans and like you
 
of levels of shenanigans and like you
could have maybe the offset calls for
 
could have maybe the offset calls for
relaxed activities versus like more
 
relaxed activities versus like more
adventurous hikes. that that's going to
 
adventurous hikes. that that's going to
be dependent on who is there and maybe
 
be dependent on who is there and maybe
even like what kind of environment or
 
even like what kind of environment or
what kind of lessons you're trying to
 
what kind of lessons you're trying to

ask like this is heretics so I'm going
 
ask like this is heretics so I'm going
to go ahead and play play the role even
 
to go ahead and play play the role even
if I don't agree with it. We we try to
 
if I don't agree with it. We we try to
like you know connect all the angles
 
like you know connect all the angles
here and push on push on the envelope
 
here and push on push on the envelope
but you know you started this in 2021.
 
but you know you started this in 2021.
You know that's when I kind of went into

in the right direction and up and to the
 
in the right direction and up and to the
right and everyone
 
right and everyone
was fairly generally doing well and then
 
was fairly generally doing well and then
obviously the last three years have been
 
obviously the last three years have been
a different
 
a different
story. Have you like seen a crackdown on
 
story. Have you like seen a crackdown on
some of this stuff? Like I I can't
 
some of this stuff? Like I I can't
imagine the last year and a half. It's
 
imagine the last year and a half. It's
like I wrote down a couple things you
 
like I wrote down a couple things you
said like take a nap before we start
 
said like take a nap before we start
like yoga easing in to the offset. Like
 
like yoga easing in to the offset. Like
are you getting like you know what I
 
are you getting like you know what I
mean? These people are trying to survive

and and that might
 
and and that might
sound you know a little polyiana when
 
sound you know a little polyiana when
folks are are scraping to stay alive.
 
folks are are scraping to stay alive.
I'm just wondering if you've seen a
 
I'm just wondering if you've seen a
difference in patience for some of that
 
difference in patience for some of that
stuff, which I love, but I had to ask
 
stuff, which I love, but I had to ask
the question. Yeah, I I think they're
 
the question. Yeah, I I think they're
you're you're doing it more
 
you're you're doing it more
strategically now. So, you know, you're
 
strategically now. So, you know, you're
making sure that there's an
 
making sure that there's an
optional 30 to 60 minute yoga session
 
optional 30 to 60 minute yoga session
and like healthy foods so that you can
 
and like healthy foods so that you can
have a conversation about planning your
 
have a conversation about planning your
next quarter or even your next year. And
 
next quarter or even your next year. And
so to me that makes sense versus like
 
so to me that makes sense versus like
singing Kumbayan doing you know blood
 
singing Kumbayan doing you know blood
brother blood sister work
 
brother blood sister work
like or or even we've
 
like or or even we've
done Clifton strengths assessments and
 
done Clifton strengths assessments and
conversations at our off sites before or
 
conversations at our off sites before or
like had the team document like personal
 
like had the team document like personal
operating systems and then share that
 
operating systems and then share that
with everyone so that you can get a
 
with everyone so that you can get a
sense of how to work with someone else
 
sense of how to work with someone else
better and then that becomes an artifact
 
better and then that becomes an artifact
that you can share in notion.
 
that you can share in notion.
And so like some of these things could
 
And so like some of these things could
be touchyfey, but are you doing it
 
be touchyfey, but are you doing it
because it will increase performance or
 
because it will increase performance or
are you doing it because you want to
 
are you doing it because you want to
waste time and money? Like I think more
 
waste time and money? Like I think more
people are doing it with a performance
 
people are doing it with a performance
lens as they're probably doing
 
lens as they're probably doing
everything else. like they're probably
 
everything else. like they're probably
hiring less people and then they're
 
hiring less people and then they're
trying to think long and hard about how
 
trying to think long and hard about how
to keep the the people on the stay team
 
to keep the the people on the stay team
more engaged than ever and you know
 
more engaged than ever and you know
working at the company longer when the
 
working at the company longer when the
potential for the the exit on their
 
potential for the the exit on their
stock options is going out farther and
 
stock options is going out farther and
farther and they're being asked to do
 
farther and they're being asked to do
more with
 
more with
less. And so I do
 
less. And so I do
thinking long and hard about how
 
thinking long and hard about how
to help people be more productive, keep
 
to help people be more productive, keep
them engaged, keep them happy is pretty
 
them engaged, keep them happy is pretty
strategic and isn't just like woo woo.
 
strategic and isn't just like woo woo.
Yeah. I I I have to say and I I've seen
 
Yeah. I I I have to say and I I've seen
this, I've heard it, I felt it for
 
this, I've heard it, I felt it for
years, like
 
years, like
investing investing in time for people
 
investing investing in time for people
to go away together. It it literally
 
to go away together. It it literally
increases like psychological and
 
increases like psychological and
organizational commitment like it it
 
organizational commitment like it it
might change someone's mind or and it's
 
might change someone's mind or and it's
not just about the company, dude. Like
 
not just about the company, dude. Like
doing this helps colleagues, peers
 
doing this helps colleagues, peers
become closer. And if you're not going
 
become closer. And if you're not going
to stay for the company, I know a lot a
 
to stay for the company, I know a lot a
lot out there right now. If you're not
 
lot out there right now. If you're not
going to stay for the company for a
 
going to stay for the company for a
reason, people stay for the people they
 
reason, people stay for the people they
work with. I think the easy Sorry,
 
work with. I think the easy Sorry,
Nolan. The easiest things to cut are
 
Nolan. The easiest things to cut are
like probably the also the highest
 
like probably the also the highest
ticket line items like chartering a
 
ticket line items like chartering a
yacht in Miami for like three or four
 
yacht in Miami for like three or four
hour outing or like booking a band to
 
hour outing or like booking a band to
come perform. Like you can cut that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
come perform. Like you can cut that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
out and just keep the keep the yoga.
 
out and just keep the keep the yoga.
Keep the yoga. Yeah. Yeah. But there
 
Keep the yoga. Yeah. Yeah. But there
there is an element of like for me
 
there is an element of like for me
ingredients have really mattered to
 
ingredients have really mattered to
making off-sites work. So one of the
 
making off-sites work. So one of the
things we did at continuum is we would
 
things we did at continuum is we would
schedule the offsite two weeks after the
 
schedule the offsite two weeks after the
board meeting and that would give me
 
board meeting and that would give me
like a week to just basically know my
 
like a week to just basically know my
ass from my face again and to sleep. And
 
ass from my face again and to sleep. And
then and then I would actually like show
 
then and then I would actually like show
up at the offsite and I would give the
 
up at the offsite and I would give the
board deck presentation. like I'd give
 
board deck presentation. like I'd give
the exact presentation I gave and there
 
the exact presentation I gave and there
is an amazing amount of trust built with
 
is an amazing amount of trust built with
the team doing that because nobody does
 
the team doing that because nobody does
that and it's like it's it's like you
 
that and it's like it's it's like you
know you're working at a seed stage or
 
know you're working at a seed stage or
series A company and you're going to
 
series A company and you're going to
want to learn how startups are built and
 
want to learn how startups are built and
so like I'm going to show you. So that's
 
so like I'm going to show you. So that's
like one thing on exec offsite. So Kelly
 
like one thing on exec offsite. So Kelly
we did this crazy I'm I'm curious about
 
we did this crazy I'm I'm curious about
like exec offsite tactics. So, you know,
 
like exec offsite tactics. So, you know,
it turns out execs have varying
 
it turns out execs have varying
relationships with their peers and you
 
relationships with their peers and you
know, it's like some of us are homies
 
know, it's like some of us are homies
and it's like we're texting all the
 
and it's like we're texting all the
time. Other others of us hate each
 
time. Other others of us hate each
other. And I think like off-sights is
 
other. And I think like off-sights is
the opportunity to try and fix those
 
the opportunity to try and fix those
relationships because there's something
 
relationships because there's something
even if you're working in the office
 
even if you're working in the office
about going offsite to fix this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
about going offsite to fix this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
into a new environment. And so, Kelly,
 
into a new environment. And so, Kelly,
we actually brought
 
we actually brought
in Andrew, I'm forgetting his last name
 
in Andrew, I'm forgetting his last name
and I'm like at Trium
 
and I'm like at Trium
Group to to do an off-site for us. And
 
Group to to do an off-site for us. And
it was one of the like craziest
 
it was one of the like craziest
experiences I've ever had because like I
 
experiences I've ever had because like I
sat down with candidly somebody who was
 
sat down with candidly somebody who was
is kind of like a friend of
 
is kind of like a friend of
me and we did this like exercise to just
 
me and we did this like exercise to just
one just one just one. Yeah, just one to
 
one just one just one. Yeah, just one to
lower to lower the waterline and then to
 
lower to lower the waterline and then to
like be able to like tell each other why
 
like be able to like tell each other why
we weren't able to trust each other. And
 
we weren't able to trust each other. And
it was kind of like he did this like
 
it was kind of like he did this like
masterful thing of like you know talk
 
masterful thing of like you know talk
about like a couple things first and
 
about like a couple things first and
then say like what is it I you know
 
then say like what is it I you know
here's the thing here's the reason here
 
here's the thing here's the reason here
on a scale of 0 to 10 my trust level
 
on a scale of 0 to 10 my trust level
with you and why and so Kelly have you
 
with you and why and so Kelly have you
seen any of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with exact
 
seen any of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with exact
offsites? Have you done any of that
 
offsites? Have you done any of that
stuff? I I haven't seen it to that
 
stuff? I I haven't seen it to that
extent and I I I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that. So
 
extent and I I I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that. So
you you hit another thing in my head
 
you you hit another thing in my head
which which I still haven't seen
 
which which I still haven't seen
addressed to the level that it should
 
addressed to the level that it should
be. And I'm also like guilty of this
 
be. And I'm also like guilty of this
sometimes is off sites should not be an
 
sometimes is off sites should not be an
an opportunity for you to cluster with
 
an opportunity for you to cluster with
people that you like or feel comfortable
 
people that you like or feel comfortable
with.
 
with.
And even to this day, I do not see
 
And even to this day, I do not see
enough controls in place to make you
 
enough controls in place to make you
hang out with fremies. And so I do think
 
hang out with fremies. And so I do think
that is something that is a big deal.
 
that is something that is a big deal.
Like talk about, you know, ROI. Like the
 
Like talk about, you know, ROI. Like the
ROI you get is is breaking those things.
 
ROI you get is is breaking those things.
And I don't see enough around that. I
 
And I don't see enough around that. I
really don't. Yeah. It's not
 
really don't. Yeah. It's not
intentional, right? And so the I guess
 
intentional, right? And so the I guess
like the thing underneath the thing
 
like the thing underneath the thing
there is like if me and Kelly are
 
there is like if me and Kelly are
hanging out with you at an offsite, you
 
hanging out with you at an offsite, you
know how we feel about you.
 
Well, not anymore. Not anymore. I'm
 
Well, not anymore. Not anymore. I'm
talking about years and years ago. Like,
 
talking about years and years ago. Like,
but
 
but
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But there is something
 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But there is something
around like the human dynamic, right?
 
around like the human dynamic, right?
That when you go to these off sites, you
 
That when you go to these off sites, you
tend to like hang out with your click.
 
tend to like hang out with your click.
Yeah. Versus like what the opposite
 
Yeah. Versus like what the opposite
should actually be true. And so the
 
should actually be true. And so the
other thing we started to do at
 
other thing we started to do at
Continuum before we we showed up is we
 
Continuum before we we showed up is we
would set intentions and make the
 
would set intentions and make the
intentions
 
intentions
public. And so like that's the other
 
public. And so like that's the other
thing is I feel like the off-site
 
thing is I feel like the off-site
masterminds are often like you know like
 
masterminds are often like you know like
in a conference room without looping
 
in a conference room without looping
anyone else in. And it turns out that
 
anyone else in. And it turns out that
like other people might be able to
 
like other people might be able to
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] help you. And so like you know
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] help you. And so like you know
looping in your like say like stating
 
looping in your like say like stating
your intentions getting feedback on the
 
your intentions getting feedback on the
process like as you are designing it is
 
process like as you are designing it is
a great way to make sure that you're
 
a great way to make sure that you're
getting ROI from the event. Yes. Yeah.
 
getting ROI from the event. Yes. Yeah.
Those those are some really good
 
Those those are some really good
points. You could facilitate that with a
 
points. You could facilitate that with a
pre-offsite feedback form. So you can
 
pre-offsite feedback form. So you can
use that two three months out to get
 
use that two three months out to get
your dietary preferences, travel
 
your dietary preferences, travel
sensitivities, those sort of things. but
 
sensitivities, those sort of things. but
then also ask like what would make this
 
then also ask like what would make this
a high ROI offsite for you and then sort
 
a high ROI offsite for you and then sort
of gather those answers and I I like the
 
of gather those answers and I I like the
idea Nolan of then open sourcing it at
 
idea Nolan of then open sourcing it at
some point. But that could inform the
 
some point. But that could inform the
agenda you
 
agenda you
create even before then. My my only
 
create even before then. My my only
caveat to what you guys were saying was
 
caveat to what you guys were saying was
like if if you have an offsite for the
 
like if if you have an offsite for the
express purposes of celebration, then
 
express purposes of celebration, then
maybe you're a little more chill about
 
maybe you're a little more chill about
the clickiness, like maybe you just are
 
the clickiness, like maybe you just are
doing it because you had this like 10x
 
doing it because you had this like 10x
year and you want everyone to have a few
 
year and you want everyone to have a few
days to relax. But otherwise, some of
 
days to relax. But otherwise, some of
the most valuable off-sites would be
 
the most valuable off-sites would be
where you're tackling people issues and
 
where you're tackling people issues and
you're bringing in an outside
 
you're bringing in an outside
facilitator, for
 
facilitator, for
example. We have many of those on the
 
example. We have many of those on the
off-site marketplace. And like after I
 
off-site marketplace. And like after I
worked at 155, I worked with Keith Farzi
 
worked at 155, I worked with Keith Farzi
from Never Eat Alone for a few months.
 
from Never Eat Alone for a few months.
And like it was my first ever consulting
 
And like it was my first ever consulting
client of like a marketing consulting
 
client of like a marketing consulting
business I had for a few years. And so I
 
business I had for a few years. And so I
I then like was part of a part of the
 
I then like was part of a part of the
National Speakers Association. and got
 
National Speakers Association. and got
to meet a lot of these like thought
 
to meet a lot of these like thought
leaders and people that got brought in
 
leaders and people that got brought in
to be facilitators for executive team
 
to be facilitators for executive team
retreats. Then I became one of those
 
retreats. Then I became one of those
myself for a few Fortune 1000s. And so
 
myself for a few Fortune 1000s. And so
it could definitely be helpful to bring
 
it could definitely be helpful to bring
someone else in
 
someone else in
externally to facilitate some of those
 
externally to facilitate some of those
conversations if you need to get two
 
conversations if you need to get two
executives to talk more, if you need to
 
executives to talk more, if you need to
get two teams to collaborate better. And
 
get two teams to collaborate better. And
then there's your ROI is like, you know,
 
then there's your ROI is like, you know,
there there's greater trust and like
 
there there's greater trust and like
problems get solved and you're not gonna
 
problems get solved and you're not gonna
lose either one of them if they're both
 
lose either one of them if they're both
critical execs. And so executive team
 
critical execs. And so executive team
retreats in general are perfect for
 
retreats in general are perfect for
offsets because the cost of getting 10,
 
offsets because the cost of getting 10,
 
to the multi-million dollar decisions
 
to the multi-million dollar decisions
and outcomes that can come out of those
 
and outcomes that can come out of those
sort of offsites. And then I would take
 
sort of offsites. And then I would take
those same ideas and try and apply it to
 
those same ideas and try and apply it to
department level off-sites or to all
 
department level off-sites or to all
hands meetings where you can be very
 
hands meetings where you can be very
intentional about seating charts of
 
intentional about seating charts of
meals and you can be very intentional
 
meals and you can be very intentional
about the sessions you're running in
 
about the sessions you're running in
order to facilitate whatever experience
 
order to facilitate whatever experience
you want which could include and and
 
you want which could include and and
probably should include tackling issues
 
probably should include tackling issues
in the company which are likely going to
 
in the company which are likely going to
be people issues and you know I would
 
be people issues and you know I would
highly recommend bringing someone in
 
highly recommend bringing someone in
who's an expert in that you could even
 
who's an expert in that you could even
do trainings
 
do trainings
on interpersonal matters
 
on interpersonal matters
