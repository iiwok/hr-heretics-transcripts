God, this is so real and people just
don't talk about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like how
 
don't talk about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like how

that don't come up in the interview, the
real real real thing, the stuff that
 
real real real thing, the stuff that

which is like if you're dealing with a
 
which is like if you're dealing with a
founder, you you know, like there is no
 
founder, you you know, like there is no
who gets to keep the house or the
 
who gets to keep the house or the
apartment or whatever, like if you're

the HR person, you're out. Like you're
 
the HR person, you're out. Like you're
out. There is no question. Like so I
 
out. There is no question. Like so I
felt like it was very clear in this
 
felt like it was very clear in this
divorce like who who was, you know, it
 
divorce like who who was, you know, it
doesn't matter there on the prenup maybe
 
doesn't matter there on the prenup maybe
get some money or whatever. you guys did
 
get some money or whatever. you guys did
a good show on how to negotiate your
 
a good show on how to negotiate your
offer or those kinds of things. Someone
 
offer or those kinds of things. Someone
should go back and listen to that. But I
 
should go back and listen to that. But I
mean the prenup, but the rest of it is
 
mean the prenup, but the rest of it is
like you're out and someone new is going
 
like you're out and someone new is going
to be stepping in. Okay. So, we had LJ
 
to be stepping in. Okay. So, we had LJ
Brock on the show about a year and a
 
Brock on the show about a year and a
half ago and LJ said something because
 
half ago and LJ said something because
you know him his relationship with Brian
 
you know him his relationship with Brian
Armstrong who's the CEO of Coinbase.
 
Armstrong who's the CEO of Coinbase.
From the outside it's like, "Oh my god,
 
From the outside it's like, "Oh my god,
you guys are so harmonious and like what
 
you guys are so harmonious and like what
did you do during the interview process
 
did you do during the interview process
that we can all learn from?" And LJ was
 
that we can all learn from?" And LJ was
like, "Honestly, you just have to live
 
like, "Honestly, you just have to live
through a fire together and you're
 
through a fire together and you're
either gonna survive through it or
 
either gonna survive through it or
you're not." Yeah, totally.
 
you're not." Yeah, totally.
What like what do you not find in the
 
What like what do you not find in the
interview process that you actually have
 
interview process that you actually have
to live through that it's like, "Oh
 
to live through that it's like, "Oh
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I got married to this person
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I got married to this person
and now I feel like we're incompatible."
 
and now I feel like we're incompatible."
Like what are those things? Yeah. I you
 
Like what are those things? Yeah. I you
know I think part of it is no one wants
 
know I think part of it is no one wants
to talk about the really really nasty
 
to talk about the really really nasty
hard stuff and sometimes you don't have
 
hard stuff and sometimes you don't have
the hard stuff to bring up and so I
 
the hard stuff to bring up and so I
really try hard to bring up the ugly
 
really try hard to bring up the ugly
stuff in the interview process. So I
 
stuff in the interview process. So I
have a whole but I have a whole bunch of
 
have a whole but I have a whole bunch of
hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nasty stuff. I mean, some of
 
hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nasty stuff. I mean, some of
it's in the, you know, Wall Street
 
it's in the, you know, Wall Street
Journal of the New York Times or, you
 
Journal of the New York Times or, you
know, so I'm lucky in that I have a
 
know, so I'm lucky in that I have a
whole passion of, you know, let me pull
 
whole passion of, you know, let me pull
from the garbage can of things to to
 
from the garbage can of things to to
talk about and what would we do and how
 
talk about and what would we do and how
would you want to handle it? And the
 
would you want to handle it? And the
problem is is for if it's a first time
 
problem is is for if it's a first time
CEO or first- time founder, they don't
 
CEO or first- time founder, they don't
actually know what they're going to do
 
actually know what they're going to do
and so they rosy it up, right? So I I
 
and so they rosy it up, right? So I I
know what I would do and they think they
 
know what I would do and they think they
know what they're going to do and then
 
know what they're going to do and then
when it really happens is when it
 
when it really happens is when it
really, you know, like that's the real
 
really, you know, like that's the real
world, the TV show, the old school TV
 
world, the TV show, the old school TV
show for those of us who are old enough
 
show for those of us who are old enough
to remember, like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] starts getting
 
to remember, like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] starts getting
real. And so you don't know, you know,
 
real. And so you don't know, you know,
and that is a little bit of having to
 
and that is a little bit of having to
say or you ask, you know, like what I
 
say or you ask, you know, like what I
get have gotten better about is asking
 
get have gotten better about is asking
board members or other people around,
 
board members or other people around,

yet. So they didn't we had no muscles

all the time. And for the record, I
always talk to like my HR leadership
 
always talk to like my HR leadership
team about it. It's not just the head
 
team about it. It's not just the head
of, you know, that's not just the top
 
of, you know, that's not just the top
job and the people role. I'm like,
 
job and the people role. I'm like,
listen, you you the t the tie is not
 
listen, you you the t the tie is not
going to go to the runner here. So, you
 
going to go to the runner here. So, you
better figure out how to unwind this and
 
better figure out how to unwind this and
like, you know, figure this out. I put
 
like, you know, figure this out. I put
it more on us to do that. And I and I
 
it more on us to do that. And I and I
say, look, it's not fair. Maybe it's not
 
say, look, it's not fair. Maybe it's not
fair, but it's the reality. Like if
 
fair, but it's the reality. Like if
nothing else, we tend to have hopefully
 
nothing else, we tend to have hopefully
higher EQ, a little bit better problem
 
higher EQ, a little bit better problem
solving skills, we can see things from
 
solving skills, we can see things from
all angles. This is the job to try to
 
all angles. This is the job to try to
figure out how to make something work or
 
figure out how to make something work or
not. So I do put it on the team and I
 
not. So I do put it on the team and I
say, "I don't care if it's fair or not.
 
say, "I don't care if it's fair or not.
I'm protecting you because if the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
I'm protecting you because if the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
hits the fan, you're probably out." The
 
hits the fan, you're probably out." The
other thing is I learned this too
 
other thing is I learned this too
because you're right, Colleen. Like
 
because you're right, Colleen. Like
interviewing usually it's like, "Hey,
 
interviewing usually it's like, "Hey,
let's court you. We're wooing you. We're
 
let's court you. We're wooing you. We're
dating. Let me give you, you know,
 
dating. Let me give you, you know,
you're in Vegas. Let's get a steak and
 
you're in Vegas. Let's get a steak and
let's go to an all you can eat whatever.
 
let's go to an all you can eat whatever.
It's so fun. It's so nice and you don't
 
It's so fun. It's so nice and you don't
talk about the hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I didn't
 
talk about the hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I didn't
learn this until a little bit later.
 
learn this until a little bit later.
Like I had lunch with a founder on
 
Like I had lunch with a founder on
Friday and I was like, tell me about
 
Friday and I was like, tell me about
your traumas. Like tell me why you would
 
your traumas. Like tell me why you would
never want to hire an HR person like or
 
never want to hire an HR person like or
any leader. like tell me what makes you
 
any leader. like tell me what makes you
so mental and angry or anxious or like
 
so mental and angry or anxious or like
what are all those things? And we never
 
what are all those things? And we never
really usually ask about that. No one
 
really usually ask about that. No one
does. And anyone like I think people at
 
does. And anyone like I think people at
all levels should ask about that because
 
all levels should ask about that because
everyone's human. Now the other point I
 
everyone's human. Now the other point I
had is I think that we should assume
 
had is I think that we should assume
there's going to be turbulence in a
 
there's going to be turbulence in a
marriage. Like you know what I mean? I
 
marriage. Like you know what I mean? I
just got married two years ago. I wasn't
 
just got married two years ago. I wasn't
like this be duckies and horses forever.
 
like this be duckies and horses forever.
No, you should assume that there's going
 
No, you should assume that there's going
to be those things. Talk about it
 
to be those things. Talk about it
upfront, but the maturity of the person
 
upfront, but the maturity of the person
matters a lot because the thing I see a
 
matters a lot because the thing I see a
lot, I don't know if you both agree, is
 
lot, I don't know if you both agree, is
something happens in the marriage and
 
something happens in the marriage and
someone just wants to throw the towel
 
someone just wants to throw the towel
and this is terrible. We're never going
 
and this is terrible. We're never going
to get through this. I don't trust you
 
to get through this. I don't trust you
anymore. They don't work through it.
 
anymore. They don't work through it.
They just kind of give up because they
 
They just kind of give up because they
didn't ever expect it to happen.
 
didn't ever expect it to happen.
And it's odder in work because you know
 
And it's odder in work because you know
in a real marriage you kind of you know
 
in a real marriage you kind of you know
whatever you try to do therapy or this
 
whatever you try to do therapy or this
or that but in work a lot of people are
 
or that but in work a lot of people are
like uh I don't want to deal with that
 
like uh I don't want to deal with that
person again or have to I don't want to
 
person again or have to I don't want to
you know go go through this and you have
 
you know go go through this and you have
to and so I do think the maturity of the
 
to and so I do think the maturity of the
leader I on either side or both matters
 
leader I on either side or both matters
a lot whether you can get through this
 
a lot whether you can get through this
or not. Hey everyone, we'll be right
 
or not. Hey everyone, we'll be right

we're just getting to know each other
 
we're just getting to know each other
it's not that bad and then it just start
 
it's not that bad and then it just start
and then it fers and it fers and it fers
 
and then it fers and it fers and it fers
and then all of a sudden it's this big
 
and then all of a sudden it's this big

those people and I am super direct and I
 
those people and I am super direct and I
don't but with a CEO my point of view is
 
don't but with a CEO my point of view is
like I don't want to be a bother and so
 
like I don't want to be a bother and so
like I want to take care of all of the
 
like I want to take care of all of the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I'm not bothering that person
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I'm not bothering that person
and actually for me what is helpful is
 
and actually for me what is helpful is
because I have done the job a few times
 
because I have done the job a few times
s I have other CEOs who can point that
 
s I have other CEOs who can point that
behavior out to me and they have told me
 
behavior out to me and they have told me
that I have done I have done that to
 
that I have done I have done that to
them where
 
them where
I have stored [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and I have told
 
I have stored [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and I have told
myself that narrative and I have worked
 
myself that narrative and I have worked
it out and then I didn't give that other
 
it out and then I didn't give that other
person a chance to even address the
 
person a chance to even address the
issue and then I like explode or I'm
 
issue and then I like explode or I'm
like so irritated and then I'm like why
 
like so irritated and then I'm like why
aren't you dealing with this and they're
 
aren't you dealing with this and they're
like what are you talking about like I
 
like what are you talking about like I
didn't even know that that was bothering
 
didn't even know that that was bothering
you or like you were worked up about
 
you or like you were worked up about
that. And so I think we, you know, to
 
that. And so I think we, you know, to
Kelly's point, like this is a little bit
 
Kelly's point, like this is a little bit
of your own self, you know, sort of
 
of your own self, you know, sort of
regulation and having your own skills
 
regulation and having your own skills
and your own maturity on how to handle
 
and your own maturity on how to handle
it of the I do think that leader in you
 
it of the I do think that leader in you
that is the I'm not the nicest person
 
that is the I'm not the nicest person
all the time, but the caretaker of the
 
all the time, but the caretaker of the
like I'm not going to be a bother. I'm a
 
like I'm not going to be a bother. I'm a
grown-up. I'm an executive. I don't you
 
grown-up. I'm an executive. I don't you
know, the worst thing that you can do
 
know, the worst thing that you can do
sometime I feel like is to like have to
 
sometime I feel like is to like have to
be a bother. I don't I'm not going to be
 
be a bother. I don't I'm not going to be
that person. So, but then I don't go in
 
that person. So, but then I don't go in
and actually give that person a chance
 
and actually give that person a chance
to even work through it. And so, you
 
to even work through it. And so, you
know, in my case, I know that and I then
 
know, in my case, I know that and I then
have to say, "Hey, this I'm I'm really
 
have to say, "Hey, this I'm I'm really
struggling right now with a few things."
 
struggling right now with a few things."
And most CEOs, I just usually will send
 
And most CEOs, I just usually will send
them like I'm a writer, so I will write
 
them like I'm a writer, so I will write
it and then say like, "Hey, I'm going to
 
it and then say like, "Hey, I'm going to
write this down. You don't need to
 
write this down. You don't need to
respond to it right away. I'm just going
 
respond to it right away. I'm just going
to need to talk about this at some point
 
to need to talk about this at some point
like so we can for me at least to move
 
like so we can for me at least to move
forward and I think depending on your
 
forward and I think depending on your
working style or relationship or and
 
working style or relationship or and
like I work in a remote environment now
 
like I work in a remote environment now
so it's even harder in that way like you
 
so it's even harder in that way like you
have to kind of you know this is where
 
have to kind of you know this is where
the EQ or the job that you're in you
 
the EQ or the job that you're in you
have to get to that point of being able
 
have to get to that point of being able
to to work through that but the
 
to to work through that but the
festering is is kind of the worst case
 
festering is is kind of the worst case
scenario before we leave this really
 
scenario before we leave this really
quickly and I'm going to just be really
 
quickly and I'm going to just be really
open about my experience here. Like I
 
open about my experience here. Like I
always say moleh hills not mountains. By
 
always say moleh hills not mountains. By
the time it's a mountain, it's it's a
 
the time it's a mountain, it's it's a
whole thing. And this is why even in my
 
whole thing. And this is why even in my
personal life, like Hillary and I will
 
personal life, like Hillary and I will
bat the ball back and forth, but it's
 
bat the ball back and forth, but it's
usually always a molehill. It never
 
usually always a molehill. It never
gets, you know, to a thing. And so here
 
gets, you know, to a thing. And so here
here's what I've learned. You guys tell
 
here's what I've learned. You guys tell
me if you agree or disagree. I was just
 
me if you agree or disagree. I was just

Nolan's point which I do appreciate that
 
Nolan's point which I do appreciate that
he is saying these things of like there
 
he is saying these things of like there
is an element that I think there was a
 
is an element that I think there was a
wave of people for a while who were
 
wave of people for a while who were
taking these roles who were not prepared
 
taking these roles who were not prepared
for the role that they were stepping
 
for the role that they were stepping
into that they had not
 
into that they had not
they sort of got elevated very quickly
 
they sort of got elevated very quickly
and it wasn't because of their age or

anything else, but they just didn't have
the reps under their belt of the pattern
 
the reps under their belt of the pattern
matching and the experience that they
 
matching and the experience that they
needed. And then they were getting into
 
needed. And then they were getting into
these jobs and they were quote head of
 
these jobs and they were quote head of
people maybe at like a 20 person
 
people maybe at like a 20 person
company, a 30 person company and and
 
company, a 30 person company and and
then things weren't working out and then
 
then things weren't working out and then
they were getting pissed off about it
 
they were getting pissed off about it
not working out and then they were kind
 
not working out and then they were kind
of sitting in the seat and getting all
 
of sitting in the seat and getting all
grumpy and some of those people I think
 
grumpy and some of those people I think
caused some of these founders to be all
 
caused some of these founders to be all
pissed off about HR and I was like well
 
pissed off about HR and I was like well
that's not HR. I mean you know like so I
 
that's not HR. I mean you know like so I
think that there's this mix of all of
 
think that there's this mix of all of
those kinds of things. I do think yes
 
those kinds of things. I do think yes
there is a I
 
there is a I
I have the flexibility in my career and
 
I have the flexibility in my career and
my life at this point and the privilege
 
my life at this point and the privilege
I know that word isn't Nolan's favorite
 
I know that word isn't Nolan's favorite
but the privilege for many reasons that
 
but the privilege for many reasons that
I have earned as a kid who grew up on
 
I have earned as a kid who grew up on
food stamps and all of those things at
 
food stamps and all of those things at
this point in my life to walk away from
 
this point in my life to walk away from
anything. I have that now. I did not
 
anything. I have that now. I did not
always have that and I do that. I use
 
always have that and I do that. I use
that agency at this point. I try to be
 
that agency at this point. I try to be
more selective though in the front end
 
more selective though in the front end
of like where I choose to put my
 
of like where I choose to put my
LinkedIn is making a statement about the
 
LinkedIn is making a statement about the
kind of place that I want to work and
 
kind of place that I want to work and
attract the people who want to come
 
attract the people who want to come
follow me to that place. So, you know,
 
follow me to that place. So, you know,
it's a it's a double-edged sword on
 
it's a it's a double-edged sword on
that. And I will also probably work hard
 
that. And I will also probably work hard
to try and make it work. But if I am not
 
to try and make it work. But if I am not
aligned, I will likely be someone who
 
aligned, I will likely be someone who
will opt out and just be like, "Nope,
 
will opt out and just be like, "Nope,
it's not for me and I'm not going to I'm
 
it's not for me and I'm not going to I'm
not going to do those kinds of things."
 
not going to do those kinds of things."
I have that privilege. Not everybody, to
 
I have that privilege. Not everybody, to
your note, Kelly, has that opportunity.
 
your note, Kelly, has that opportunity.
I think we see a lot of those people
 
I think we see a lot of those people
now. Like I do think that's the world,
 
now. Like I do think that's the world,
not just in this role, but in lots of
 
not just in this role, but in lots of
worlds where they don't have that that
 
worlds where they don't have that that
sort of and that's a choice though. I
 
sort of and that's a choice though. I
mean to me if you are staying in a job
 
mean to me if you are staying in a job
that you don't are not aligned and if
 
that you don't are not aligned and if
you are in the he you know we've had
 
you are in the he you know we've had
this conversation many times but like if
 
this conversation many times but like if
you are in the head of people seat and
 
you are in the head of people seat and
you are out of alignment with your CEO
 
you are out of alignment with your CEO
and you are choosing to stay in that job
 
and you are choosing to stay in that job
while out of alignment that is a
 
while out of alignment that is a
conscious choice that you are making
 
conscious choice that you are making
about your own leadership and influence
 
about your own leadership and influence
and I would question
 
and I would question
how long you can choose to stay in that
 
how long you can choose to stay in that
seat for your own mental and you know
 
seat for your own mental and you know
sort of ability to function and your
 
sort of ability to function and your
happiness and then and your own value
 
happiness and then and your own value
system or for whatever reason and then
 
system or for whatever reason and then
also how long your longevity really is
 
also how long your longevity really is
going to be because if you're not really
 
going to be because if you're not really
that influential and you're not that
 
that influential and you're not that
connected my bet is that that founder is
 
connected my bet is that that founder is
eventually or that CEO is eventually
 
eventually or that CEO is eventually
going to realize that there might be
 
going to realize that there might be
somebody else out there who is going to
 
somebody else out there who is going to
be in alignment with me and I might want
 
be in alignment with me and I might want
to make that cho that divorce is going
 
to make that cho that divorce is going
to happen at some point and maybe you
 
to happen at some point and maybe you
should be preparing for that. Like do
 
should be preparing for that. Like do
take some action on your side to start
 
take some action on your side to start
preparing yourself for that which is
 
preparing yourself for that which is
goes back to this post about like maybe
 
goes back to this post about like maybe
you should be more actionoriented about
 
you should be more actionoriented about
that and not so laxidasical to allow
 
that and not so laxidasical to allow
that to happen. So yeah and I I agree. I
 
that to happen. So yeah and I I agree. I
think you know my my message on this is
 
think you know my my message on this is
that everyone can have this
 
that everyone can have this
conversation. This is not just for with
 
conversation. This is not just for with
agency. And this is where it's not a
 
agency. And this is where it's not a
