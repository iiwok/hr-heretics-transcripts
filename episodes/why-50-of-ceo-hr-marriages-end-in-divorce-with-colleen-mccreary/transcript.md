What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment. We were
welcoming back our third bestie, Colleen
McCree. What's up, Colleen? It's good to
see you. Hello everybody. So nice to be
here. All right. So, you dropped the CEO
VP of HR divorce rate on Medium and
LinkedIn a few weeks ago and I want to
talk about it today. So, can you give
the primer to the audience on what this
post was about and what what actually
caused you to write it too? Yeah, it it
is it literally exactly what happened in
the post. I got a phone call actually
from a friend of mine who is a a VC and
he was calling for a little advice
because he had a CEO who had broken up
with his head of HR and he was totally
perplexed because he's like they did
everything right. They had you know sort
of talked for a long time. They had she
was super seasoned. He like felt like he
interviewed lots of candidates and they
had all the coffees and meet and greets
and they interviewed each other and you
know and they only lasted like six
months and the whole thing blew up and
now he you know he's like I don't really
know what went wrong. he's he's a little
bit of a micromanager and she like
totally stomped her way out and you know
he's like I don't know what to do like
what kind of person should I hire next
and you know and in his mind he's like
you know who who should I go find me who
tell me who to refer like all this kind
of stuff and I you know I started
laughing because I said oh that's pretty
normal like you know like this this is a
divorce like you know half of marriages
don't work there's a whole reason for
that And and so we talked about it and
after I you know we finished I got off
the phone with him I was like you know I
should write about this like this is a
good topic to to write about and I I
haven't been writing as much because you
know when you're an operator you
actually are working all the time and
I've been storing up content and but
this one it was so fresh and so true and
and frankly even in my own operator role
to be honest like I I feel like I do a
pretty good job in the sort of CEO
dating process. Um, and I my current CEO
like he read all of my blogs. He
listened to all these podcasts I had
done. And even then, like it's been work
to get us to the right understanding and
how we work together and talk to each
other and kind of live together, you
know, like how do you really live like a
marriage, you know? And so I felt like,
God, this is so real and people just
don't talk about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like how
hard it really is. And and so I was
thinking about the things that come up
that don't come up in the interview, the
real real real thing, the stuff that
comes up. And then the honest truth,
which is like if you're dealing with a
founder, you you know, like there is no
who gets to keep the house or the
apartment or whatever, like if you're
the HR person, you're out. Like you're
out. There is no question. Like so I
felt like it was very clear in this
divorce like who who was, you know, it
doesn't matter there on the prenup maybe
get some money or whatever. you guys did
a good show on how to negotiate your
offer or those kinds of things. Someone
should go back and listen to that. But I
mean the prenup, but the rest of it is
like you're out and someone new is going
to be stepping in. Okay. So, we had LJ
Brock on the show about a year and a
half ago and LJ said something because
you know him his relationship with Brian
Armstrong who's the CEO of Coinbase.
From the outside it's like, "Oh my god,
you guys are so harmonious and like what
did you do during the interview process
that we can all learn from?" And LJ was
like, "Honestly, you just have to live
through a fire together and you're
either gonna survive through it or
you're not." Yeah, totally.
What like what do you not find in the
interview process that you actually have
to live through that it's like, "Oh
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I got married to this person
and now I feel like we're incompatible."
Like what are those things? Yeah. I you
know I think part of it is no one wants
to talk about the really really nasty
hard stuff and sometimes you don't have
the hard stuff to bring up and so I
really try hard to bring up the ugly
stuff in the interview process. So I
have a whole but I have a whole bunch of
hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nasty stuff. I mean, some of
it's in the, you know, Wall Street
Journal of the New York Times or, you
know, so I'm lucky in that I have a
whole passion of, you know, let me pull
from the garbage can of things to to
talk about and what would we do and how
would you want to handle it? And the
problem is is for if it's a first time
CEO or first- time founder, they don't
actually know what they're going to do
and so they rosy it up, right? So I I
know what I would do and they think they
know what they're going to do and then
when it really happens is when it
really, you know, like that's the real
world, the TV show, the old school TV
show for those of us who are old enough
to remember, like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] starts getting
real. And so you don't know, you know,
and that is a little bit of having to
say or you ask, you know, like what I
get have gotten better about is asking
board members or other people around,
hey, give me an example of a time that
you worked with this person and you saw
them have to go through a hard time. I
don't like to work with I mean it's a
personal choice but one of the things I
learned after Zinga was I said I don't
want to work for a CEO who's never been
through a hard time because that was
what one of the things at Zinga is they
had they had not tripped over anything
yet. So they didn't we had no muscles
when things got hard and I felt like
that was a failure. So that was like a
learning of like, hey, did you almost
not make payroll one time or did have
you not had a whole bunch of executives
quit on you or have you, you know, had
your stock drop in half o, you know,
sort of overnight? Like picking these
things or, you know, like one of my I
think the other thing for you as the HR
person is like what are those things
that are the triggers that get you all
worked up? I have some big big ass
triggers and I am not afraid to walk
away from something. A big trigger for
me is extortion. So, and and this is one
that really comes up all of the time,
which is,
you know, sort of the bribery of like,
well, this person's going to quit if we
don't pay them whatever or we don't
promote them right now or what. And I I
have a very solid line on this like, and
so many leaders do not. And I am like I
like why bother with calibration if you
do those kinds of things or why bother
having a promotion process or why having
any of these things and they're like and
people will say like oh yeah yeah I
agree with that and then top salesperson
is about to walk out the door or my you
know very very entitled engineer who's
written the best code ever is about to
leave and and all of that c all of that
sort of like Yeah, I agree with you has
now just fallen to the into a puddle or
some your CEO agrees with you but then
you know everybody else on the
management team does not and you forgot
like maybe I didn't socialize that with
all of them. You can't figure those
things out, right? And you can't Yeah.
Yeah. You can't figure but I I've never
heard the the counter offer euphemism as
extortion. That's that one's new for me.
I enjoy that. I think of it as extortion
but like Yeah. What about for you,
Kelly? Like, no. Look, I I think this
is, you know, I I I said the same thing
all the time. And for the record, I
always talk to like my HR leadership
team about it. It's not just the head
of, you know, that's not just the top
job and the people role. I'm like,
listen, you you the t the tie is not
going to go to the runner here. So, you
better figure out how to unwind this and
like, you know, figure this out. I put
it more on us to do that. And I and I
say, look, it's not fair. Maybe it's not
fair, but it's the reality. Like if
nothing else, we tend to have hopefully
higher EQ, a little bit better problem
solving skills, we can see things from
all angles. This is the job to try to
figure out how to make something work or
not. So I do put it on the team and I
say, "I don't care if it's fair or not.
I'm protecting you because if the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
hits the fan, you're probably out." The
other thing is I learned this too
because you're right, Colleen. Like
interviewing usually it's like, "Hey,
let's court you. We're wooing you. We're
dating. Let me give you, you know,
you're in Vegas. Let's get a steak and
let's go to an all you can eat whatever.
It's so fun. It's so nice and you don't
talk about the hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I didn't
learn this until a little bit later.
Like I had lunch with a founder on
Friday and I was like, tell me about
your traumas. Like tell me why you would
never want to hire an HR person like or
any leader. like tell me what makes you
so mental and angry or anxious or like
what are all those things? And we never
really usually ask about that. No one
does. And anyone like I think people at
all levels should ask about that because
everyone's human. Now the other point I
had is I think that we should assume
there's going to be turbulence in a
marriage. Like you know what I mean? I
just got married two years ago. I wasn't
like this be duckies and horses forever.
No, you should assume that there's going
to be those things. Talk about it
upfront, but the maturity of the person
matters a lot because the thing I see a
lot, I don't know if you both agree, is
something happens in the marriage and
someone just wants to throw the towel
and this is terrible. We're never going
to get through this. I don't trust you
anymore. They don't work through it.
They just kind of give up because they
didn't ever expect it to happen.
And it's odder in work because you know
in a real marriage you kind of you know
whatever you try to do therapy or this
or that but in work a lot of people are
like uh I don't want to deal with that
person again or have to I don't want to
you know go go through this and you have
to and so I do think the maturity of the
leader I on either side or both matters
a lot whether you can get through this
or not. Hey everyone, we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talented signal fire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metivview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
MeteView. Head over to metav.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
I was just going to say I think that
that is a really big component to this
which is the identifying
you know when the awkwardness is
starting or where those points of
friction are beginning and catching it
early enough so that you can start to
work through it before like I think what
happens is a lot of people just sort of
like shove it away shove it away shove
it you know like you do right like you
just ignore it pretend it's not there if
I pretend it's not there or oh it's oh
we're just getting to know each other
it's not that bad and then it just start
and then it fers and it fers and it fers
and then all of a sudden it's this big
thing and I will tell you I am one of
those people and I am super direct and I
don't but with a CEO my point of view is
like I don't want to be a bother and so
like I want to take care of all of the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I'm not bothering that person
and actually for me what is helpful is
because I have done the job a few times
s I have other CEOs who can point that
behavior out to me and they have told me
that I have done I have done that to
them where
I have stored [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and I have told
myself that narrative and I have worked
it out and then I didn't give that other
person a chance to even address the
issue and then I like explode or I'm
like so irritated and then I'm like why
aren't you dealing with this and they're
like what are you talking about like I
didn't even know that that was bothering
you or like you were worked up about
that. And so I think we, you know, to
Kelly's point, like this is a little bit
of your own self, you know, sort of
regulation and having your own skills
and your own maturity on how to handle
it of the I do think that leader in you
that is the I'm not the nicest person
all the time, but the caretaker of the
like I'm not going to be a bother. I'm a
grown-up. I'm an executive. I don't you
know, the worst thing that you can do
sometime I feel like is to like have to
be a bother. I don't I'm not going to be
that person. So, but then I don't go in
and actually give that person a chance
to even work through it. And so, you
know, in my case, I know that and I then
have to say, "Hey, this I'm I'm really
struggling right now with a few things."
And most CEOs, I just usually will send
them like I'm a writer, so I will write
it and then say like, "Hey, I'm going to
write this down. You don't need to
respond to it right away. I'm just going
to need to talk about this at some point
like so we can for me at least to move
forward and I think depending on your
working style or relationship or and
like I work in a remote environment now
so it's even harder in that way like you
have to kind of you know this is where
the EQ or the job that you're in you
have to get to that point of being able
to to work through that but the
festering is is kind of the worst case
scenario before we leave this really
quickly and I'm going to just be really
open about my experience here. Like I
always say moleh hills not mountains. By
the time it's a mountain, it's it's a
whole thing. And this is why even in my
personal life, like Hillary and I will
bat the ball back and forth, but it's
usually always a molehill. It never
gets, you know, to a thing. And so here
here's what I've learned. You guys tell
me if you agree or disagree. I was just
coaching one of my, you know, first-time
head of people clients the other week
and I said, "Listen, especially
founders, it's a hard line to tow
because you can't let things go too far
and you also can't bug them too much
because they'll just get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pissed
and they'll get then why did why did I
hire you is what I think." Yeah. Why do
what do I need you for? They'll get
annoyed at you. you're like an annoying
gnat and they're like, "I'll start
cancing 101 ones." That's a sign your
one ones start dropping. They start
working around you. They start doing
stuff without you. And I'm like,
"Listen, so you got to figure out a way
to get build a relationship with this
founder where no one's, you know,
founder. I I can go to him every week
with something that might be kind of
annoying in a way that's not annoying."
And like he can hear it. And I do think
this is where the levity I think helps a
lot. Founders listen more when they
don't think it's a big deal. If you're
the HR person coming to them with like a
ton of bricks and like listen I got to
talk to you about something or even the
writing thing Colleen like if people
write me memo I'm like oh my god this is
a big deal. Like no I bring it up
informal casual. Hey take it or leave
it. This is like a level three out of a
 
It's easier to give them more feedback
that way. And that's how I work, too.
It's just something to try because if
you're too heavy and too much, it's like
a relationship. It's like, I don't want
to date you anymore. It's way too Yeah.
way too much. Yeah, that's good. It's
great advice because you're totally
right. I think there is
some sort of bias with HR leaders of
like they're they're wearing a lot of
heavy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maybe every week is what it
is and then they they come to the
founder and they're like, "Here's the
heavy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for And it's like, no, no,
actually your job is just to be a filter
and to filter it through to where it's
like, this is what's up, right? Like,
hey, we're on this. And you have to be
able to understand the temperature
control on each of these things, right?
Like what's burning and on fire versus
just like, oh, this thing's on the back
burner. It's totally fine. It's like at
a one out of 10. Yeah. Yeah. Terry's
spitting out again. Don't worry about
it. It's hard to decipher that. Going
back to the the divorce rate thing,
Colleen, I think the the marriage is the
perfect analog. And you know, I talk to
people about this all the time. We
forget this. The most important things
in life. Who you marry, where you live,
where you work. Those are the three
things. There's a couple of other things
for sure, but like that's the three
things, right? If health and all the
other things are in order. And I think
about it all the time for call it you
know senior director and above. When you
are at that level
you get married on LinkedIn everybody
sees it. Everybody everybody knows
right? All of your friends know. All
your parents know your siblings know.
Everybody knows you got all the VC
talent partners know right? Everybody
sees that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and there is this like oh
my god you know if you look in you know
four or five months in you're like this
is a nightmare. I think a lot of people
are just like let me push through. And I
think you know I saw somebody do this
recently to where they were like it just
wasn't a fit and they left after 3
months. And I actually think like I
really respect that. This is somebody
who had had like a number of like long
stints up until that point. I I am
coming to believe that true happiness
lies in being honest. And obviously
you're going to try and work things out,
right? Like that's it's like the the
foundation here. But I think misery
happens when you just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got
to be here for two to three years. Like
I got to tuck in and make this thing
happen. I a lot of people do that and
just eat and then they, you know, then
that's where the animosity comes from.
you hate the other person, you know,
your whole life becomes this just like
snowball and un and unhappy. Let me
challenge you both. This is my last
point. That all sounds wonderful and if
I'm listening to this, I'm like a
director, senior director level trying
to do my thing or whatnot.
I feel like agency and experience plays
a lot into this cuz I was not always
like this. So, let me just try to call
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a little bit and say that's
great because you can walk down the
street and say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off to anyone.
Colleen, you have so much agency. What
do I do when I'm like the first time
head of people and Nolan I I want to
make it work? Like we all know if you
have three or four stints that are like
oh didn't work out. It's kind of like uh
like what what do I do when I'm when I
don't have that agency like you do?
Well, first you have to earn the right.
Like I'm totally agreeing with you. Like
you have to earn the right. And the
thing is especially earlier in your
career. Like you do have to like earlier
in your career you have to work harder.
You have to get people coffee. You have
to eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like that's just part of
the deal. I had to do that. There's no
skipping those levels. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean I do I do think there is an
element of old lady speaking here of to
Nolan's point which I do appreciate that
he is saying these things of like there
is an element that I think there was a
wave of people for a while who were
taking these roles who were not prepared
for the role that they were stepping
into that they had not
they sort of got elevated very quickly
and it wasn't because of their age or
anything else, but they just didn't have
the reps under their belt of the pattern
matching and the experience that they
needed. And then they were getting into
these jobs and they were quote head of
people maybe at like a 20 person
company, a 30 person company and and
then things weren't working out and then
they were getting pissed off about it
not working out and then they were kind
of sitting in the seat and getting all
grumpy and some of those people I think
caused some of these founders to be all
pissed off about HR and I was like well
that's not HR. I mean you know like so I
think that there's this mix of all of
those kinds of things. I do think yes
there is a I
I have the flexibility in my career and
my life at this point and the privilege
I know that word isn't Nolan's favorite
but the privilege for many reasons that
I have earned as a kid who grew up on
food stamps and all of those things at
this point in my life to walk away from
anything. I have that now. I did not
always have that and I do that. I use
that agency at this point. I try to be
more selective though in the front end
of like where I choose to put my
LinkedIn is making a statement about the
kind of place that I want to work and
attract the people who want to come
follow me to that place. So, you know,
it's a it's a double-edged sword on
that. And I will also probably work hard
to try and make it work. But if I am not
aligned, I will likely be someone who
will opt out and just be like, "Nope,
it's not for me and I'm not going to I'm
not going to do those kinds of things."
I have that privilege. Not everybody, to
your note, Kelly, has that opportunity.
I think we see a lot of those people
now. Like I do think that's the world,
not just in this role, but in lots of
worlds where they don't have that that
sort of and that's a choice though. I
mean to me if you are staying in a job
that you don't are not aligned and if
you are in the he you know we've had
this conversation many times but like if
you are in the head of people seat and
you are out of alignment with your CEO
and you are choosing to stay in that job
while out of alignment that is a
conscious choice that you are making
about your own leadership and influence
and I would question
how long you can choose to stay in that
seat for your own mental and you know
sort of ability to function and your
happiness and then and your own value
system or for whatever reason and then
also how long your longevity really is
going to be because if you're not really
that influential and you're not that
connected my bet is that that founder is
eventually or that CEO is eventually
going to realize that there might be
somebody else out there who is going to
be in alignment with me and I might want
to make that cho that divorce is going
to happen at some point and maybe you
should be preparing for that. Like do
take some action on your side to start
preparing yourself for that which is
goes back to this post about like maybe
you should be more actionoriented about
that and not so laxidasical to allow
that to happen. So yeah and I I agree. I
think you know my my message on this is
that everyone can have this
conversation. This is not just for with
agency. And this is where it's not a
one-sizefits-all. So, I don't want
people to take this conversation, run
around being like, you're terrible. I
want a divorce and all this. It's
depends on the situation. It depends on
the person. And listen, a lot of
divorces are amicable. I had one in
 
know that there is a way to get divorced
that's also a win-win. You could leave
with half the house. You can leave with
alimony. You can leave with like it's
really important when you when you
figure out it's not the right thing to
do it the right way because again the
tide's not going to go to the runner on
that one either. I do think that is the
most important message for this whole
thing which is we we have I heard you
say this over and over and over and I
cannot emphasize it enough that this
world is so small.
How you leave this divorce is going to
matter for you. I mean it will matter.
So leaving nicely, leaving gracefully,
you know, do not leave a dumpster fire
and it will not taking the high road.
This is honestly like I I have I have
not done this well. These are my biggest
regrets in life. Like in almost all of
my relationship, I just like I I have
not done it well and I regret it so
much. like just take the high road. Even
you get emotional in the moment and it's
just you try and think of the person
five years from now looking back on the
moment is is now my new framework for it
because when you're in the moment you're
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pissed and it's just like you
have to transcend that and be the bigger
person. The VC who called me
I have known him
 
since maybe 2011. I mean, so this is
going back a long time. I've known this
guy a long time very since he was not a
VC, you know, and so the we keep saying
this over and over and if you are early
in your career, the relationships matter
who you meet. I it happens to me all the
time. someone who was a college intern
of mine in 1990 whatever is a you know
founder wherever is the you know CTO of
big companies like these relationships
that I built 30 years ago you never
would have imagined that someone is
still saying like oh you know I knew you
