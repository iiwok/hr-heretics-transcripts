human yet like technically astute CFOs
 
human yet like technically astute CFOs
I've worked with like this is someone
 
I've worked with like this is someone
that's this this Perfect Blend of like a
 
that's this this Perfect Blend of like a
human first leader that's just a WI is
 
human first leader that's just a WI is
with all the things around the business
 
with all the things around the business
and I just is that was that intentional
 
and I just is that was that intentional
how did you think about that early on
 
how did you think about that early on
how did you hone that part of it because
 
how did you hone that part of it because
I haven't worked with a lot of CFOs with
 
I haven't worked with a lot of CFOs with
that level of of humanity and their
 
that level of of humanity and their
leadership it's interesting because I
 
leadership it's interesting because I
think it comes down to just who I am as
 
think it comes down to just who I am as
a person and at the end of the day like
 
a person and at the end of the day like
I I want to treat others as I want to
 
I I want to treat others as I want to
treat myself and so like I want to be
 
treat myself and so like I want to be
treated well and I want others to have a
 
treated well and I want others to have a
human really good experience in in
 
human really good experience in in
business and as a leader I grew up with
 
business and as a leader I grew up with
just a lot of good role modeling in the
 
just a lot of good role modeling in the
family and then just went through a lot
 
family and then just went through a lot
of personal Challenge and overcame a lot
 
of personal Challenge and overcame a lot
of different things that I think make me
 
of different things that I think make me
better as a leader because I'm just I'm
 
better as a leader because I'm just I'm
more in touch with how people are
 
more in touch with how people are
feeling what they're going through and
 
feeling what they're going through and
so at the end of the day we're here to
 
so at the end of the day we're here to
drive the business we're here to make
 
drive the business we're here to make
business results and here to add
 
business results and here to add
shareholder value but we're also working
 
shareholder value but we're also working
together as people every single day and
 
together as people every single day and
we want to be treated well and at the
 
we want to be treated well and at the
end of the day to me I want to be that
 
end of the day to me I want to be that
type of leader that's going to be you
 
type of leader that's going to be you
know authentic empathetic that's going
 
know authentic empathetic that's going
to understand what where people are
 
to understand what where people are
coming from and approach the business in
 
coming from and approach the business in
that same way and so you know I think
 
that same way and so you know I think
the best thing I'd say about this is
 
the best thing I'd say about this is
that early on all of us find out what
 
that early on all of us find out what
bad is in management we've all had that
 
bad is in management we've all had that
experience where it's like I don't want
 
experience where it's like I don't want
to be that because I didn't feel good
 
to be that because I didn't feel good
sitting on the other side of that and
 
sitting on the other side of that and
that's not what I want to be and so
 
that's not what I want to be and so
sometimes you have to go through that
 
sometimes you have to go through that
pretty early in your career to realize
 
pretty early in your career to realize
what you want to take from that
 
what you want to take from that
situation what you don't want to be and
 
situation what you don't want to be and
what you want to be as a leader and so I
 
what you want to be as a leader and so I
think that that happening early in a
 
think that that happening early in a
career can be really powerful for people
 
career can be really powerful for people
and setting them on the right path
 
and setting them on the right path
that's you stole my line I always say
 
that's you stole my line I always say
you learn more from Bad managers than
 
you learn more from Bad managers than
you do from good and my my first manager
 
you do from good and my my first manager

at Google who I hope doesn't listen to

the Pod was terrible and I learned so

and we're in a really unusual time and
 
and we're in a really unusual time and
just the industries and just what's been
 
just the industries and just what's been
going on and so um you
 
going on and so um you
know even with the changes in the
 
know even with the changes in the
organization structures right and the
 
organization structures right and the
dynamic of the teams looking differently
 
dynamic of the teams looking differently

importance of oneto ones on talking to
 
importance of oneto ones on talking to
your team on interactions on development
 
your team on interactions on development
all of that now I would say the the
 
all of that now I would say the the
world has changed a little bit in terms
 
world has changed a little bit in terms
of what does development look like now
 
of what does development look like now
right for years it used to be people
 
right for years it used to be people
used to define development as I want to
 
used to define development as I want to
get promoted I want to be I want to move
 
get promoted I want to be I want to move
up into an organization and with maybe
 
up into an organization and with maybe
flatter organizations or just the
 
flatter organizations or just the
reality of the business landscape today
 
reality of the business landscape today
sometimes those the opportunities for
 
sometimes those the opportunities for
growth and learning are not necessarily
 
growth and learning are not necessarily
with getting that promotion but in
 
with getting that promotion but in
learning across the organization and
 
learning across the organization and
learning across on projects and so I
 
learning across on projects and so I
spent a lot of time trying to bring in
 
spent a lot of time trying to bring in
topics that are relevant to the team
 
topics that are relevant to the team
that might be interesting bringing in
 
that might be interesting bringing in
leaders from other functions to talk to
 
leaders from other functions to talk to
the team because at the end of the day
 
the team because at the end of the day
if you know more about the business in
 
if you know more about the business in
all functions of the business not just
 
all functions of the business not just
wearing your Finance hat your tax hat
 
wearing your Finance hat your tax hat
your accounting hat or whatever function
 
your accounting hat or whatever function
you might sit in even in the people team
 
you might sit in even in the people team
like being able to be well rounded and
 
like being able to be well rounded and
understanding all aspects of the
 
understanding all aspects of the
business makes you a better stronger
 
business makes you a better stronger
contributor to the organization even in
 
contributor to the organization even in
the company you're in today or in the
 
the company you're in today or in the
companies you're going to go to in the
 
companies you're going to go to in the
future so for me it's a lot about
 
future so for me it's a lot about
opportunities for development and growth
 
opportunities for development and growth
in different ways than maybe it was
 
in different ways than maybe it was
traditionally in the past yeah so let's
 
traditionally in the past yeah so let's
let's take a beat on that so Kelly and I
 
let's take a beat on that so Kelly and I
have talked recently about promotion
 
have talked recently about promotion
Obsession and I would say promotion
 
Obsession and I would say promotion
Obsession was like the thing from 2012
 
Obsession was like the thing from 2012
basically through 2021
 
basically through 2021
and we were in a labor constrained
 
and we were in a labor constrained
market and so employees who weren't
 
market and so employees who weren't
getting promoted were like all right
 
getting promoted were like all right
peace out I'm going to go get my
 
peace out I'm going to go get my
promotion through another job at another
 
promotion through another job at another
company now the labor market has flipped
 
company now the labor market has flipped
there's a ton of great people that are
 
there's a ton of great people that are
currently on the market and what I keep
 
currently on the market and what I keep
hearing from operators internally is
 
hearing from operators internally is
that there is more scrutiny and pressure
 
that there is more scrutiny and pressure
being applied to internal promotions are
 
being applied to internal promotions are
you guys seeing the same thing I hear it
 
you guys seeing the same thing I hear it
but I don't necessarily think that I've
 
but I don't necessarily think that I've
changed my standards or that I have had
 
changed my standards or that I have had
a different kind of a level of of kind
 
a different kind of a level of of kind
of approach to how I'm I'm handling
 
of approach to how I'm I'm handling
promotion so I would say the flat
 
promotion so I would say the flat
organizations mean less opportunity
 
organizations mean less opportunity
right because at the end of the day I
 
right because at the end of the day I
think it has to be two things you have
 
think it has to be two things you have
to be ready for the promotion and there
 
to be ready for the promotion and there
has to be an available position for that
 
has to be an available position for that
promotion and we don't want to just kind
 
promotion and we don't want to just kind
of have structures where all levels rise
 
of have structures where all levels rise
up and then you end up with just a bunch
 
up and then you end up with just a bunch
of senior Folks at the end of the day it
 
of senior Folks at the end of the day it
doesn't really work and that's not
 
doesn't really work and that's not
really a great leadership experience for
 
really a great leadership experience for
that individual so I think that while I
 
that individual so I think that while I
hear there is more scrutiny and
 
hear there is more scrutiny and
certainly there's less maybe
 
certainly there's less maybe
opportunity I don't think I've wavered
 
opportunity I don't think I've wavered
in kind of like what I would approach as
 
in kind of like what I would approach as
the standards for getting to that
 
the standards for getting to that
promotion and what that looks like and
 
promotion and what that looks like and
so I think it's personal I think it
 
so I think it's personal I think it
depends on what that Leader's approaches
 
depends on what that Leader's approaches
to the business and what that looks like
 
to the business and what that looks like
but in my situations I think we are
 
but in my situations I think we are
still leaning in on our top talent and
 
still leaning in on our top talent and
people that we think have high potential
 
people that we think have high potential
to get them to that next level we care
 
to get them to that next level we care
deeply about that is there less opportun

um over the years what I would say is
that you know one of the things that has
 
that you know one of the things that has

transactional like years ago like we
 
transactional like years ago like we
were just kind of doing these processes
 
were just kind of doing these processes
and making them happen and and doing all
 
and making them happen and and doing all
that I think what's changed over the
 
that I think what's changed over the
years is it's become more strategic
 
years is it's become more strategic
right the people role the finance role
 
right the people role the finance role
were really involved in the setting the
 
were really involved in the setting the
company Strat strategy and being more

think Kelly you do that as well like
it's just really being a part of that
 
it's just really being a part of that
and guiding it it yeah I mean it cannot
 
and guiding it it yeah I mean it cannot
be separate planets it it literally at
 
be separate planets it it literally at
Peak Performance these two functions are
 
Peak Performance these two functions are
a ven diagram and the more they overlap
 
a ven diagram and the more they overlap
the the better in that sense and we've
 
the the better in that sense and we've
talked about it before in different
 
talked about it before in different
episodes and you you hited to it as far

any stories or learnings or things that
 
any stories or learnings or things that

relationship with their
 
relationship with their
CFO one of the best ways I think that
 
CFO one of the best ways I think that
people team and the finance team work
 
people team and the finance team work
collaboratively and together is when it
 
collaboratively and together is when it
comes to aligning performance to the
 
comes to aligning performance to the
performance of the company right and so
 
performance of the company right and so
at the end of the day like we're here to
 
at the end of the day like we're here to
drive shareholder value we're here to
 
drive shareholder value we're here to
grow the business we're here to get to
 
grow the business we're here to get to
those financial results but if you as
 
those financial results but if you as
the people leader and me as the finance
 
the people leader and me as the finance
leader if we come together and we're
 
leader if we come together and we're
thinking about do we have the right
 
thinking about do we have the right
incentives in place is the structure for
 
incentives in place is the structure for
our organization working that we're
 
our organization working that we're
getting the best business results as a
 
getting the best business results as a
result of what we're doing to design the
 
result of what we're doing to design the
programs and the practices and the
 
programs and the practices and the
structure to align to that and I think
 
structure to align to that and I think
that's when it can be really magical
 
that's when it can be really magical
like Kelly you and I worked together
 
like Kelly you and I worked together
when we've had issues on maybe the way
 
when we've had issues on maybe the way
our sales and go to market strategy is
 
our sales and go to market strategy is
happening and knowing that that's
 
happening and knowing that that's
changing and going well you know what
 
changing and going well you know what
the way we've been doing the
 
the way we've been doing the
compensation before doesn't really align
 
compensation before doesn't really align
to where we're taking the company and
 
to where we're taking the company and
what worked in the past isn't always
 
what worked in the past isn't always
going to work with what's coming forward
 
going to work with what's coming forward
and so what do we need to do to
 
and so what do we need to do to
structurally change that and what do we
 
structurally change that and what do we
need to do to kind of create the right
 
need to do to kind of create the right
in incentives and create the right
 
in incentives and create the right

say that's one dimension the other
dimension which I think is so important
 
dimension which I think is so important

is that team like is this a team that
you believe in that that has proven
 
you believe in that that has proven
track record of success like when things
 
track record of success like when things

work with me not against me someone
that's going to have a foundation of
 
that's going to have a foundation of
trust and respect and someone I'm going
 
trust and respect and someone I'm going
to work with and and it's hard in an
 
to work with and and it's hard in an
interview to get at that it really is
 
interview to get at that it really is
and the reason I say that is because
 
and the reason I say that is because
it's we all know that when you get into
 
it's we all know that when you get into
the tough situations that's you know
 
the tough situations that's you know
that's how you see how people handle
 
that's how you see how people handle
adversity and you don't always know how
 
adversity and you don't always know how
they're going to act when you're going
 
they're going to act when you're going
into an interview situation on both
 
into an interview situation on both
sides right and so the only advice I the
 
sides right and so the only advice I the
couple things that advice that I I give
 
couple things that advice that I I give
to folks is that you know you can't
 
to folks is that you know you can't
fully test for the values or when what's
 
fully test for the values or when what's
going to happen when the going gets
 
going to happen when the going gets
tough but you can talk about Stories the
 
tough but you can talk about Stories the
stories you've had the stories you've
 
stories you've had the stories you've
been through and get insights in that
 
been through and get insights in that
discussion what happens when this
 
discussion what happens when this
happens or what about this situation
 
happens or what about this situation
when it didn't go right or it didn't go
 
when it didn't go right or it didn't go
well and just listen see how they
 
well and just listen see how they
respond in that moment because it gives
 
respond in that moment because it gives
you a good indication
 
you a good indication
as to what that person's going to be
 
as to what that person's going to be
like when you're in the trenches
 
like when you're in the trenches

together and so I encourage folks to use
storytelling and talk about situations
 
storytelling and talk about situations
in the interview process to give you
 
in the interview process to give you
those insights I also say do your
 
those insights I also say do your
diligence right like I've been

important to be really thinking in that
 
important to be really thinking in that
Dimension and sometimes you'll find that
 
Dimension and sometimes you'll find that
the course of a deal changes from the
 
the course of a deal changes from the
beginning to the end right you might
 
beginning to the end right you might
start the conversation thinking that it
 
start the conversation thinking that it
makes sense for the founder or the CEO

of that company to stay on you might
 
of that company to stay on you might
change that view by the end of the deal
 
change that view by the end of the deal
or vice versa and that can be very
 
or vice versa and that can be very
emotionally challenging and you have to
 
emotionally challenging and you have to
have a lot of kind of self-awareness and
 
have a lot of kind of self-awareness and
you have to have a lot of kind grounding
 
you have to have a lot of kind grounding
in those moments to be able to kind of

like look this isn't happening or this
is happening have you ever vetoed in
 
is happening have you ever vetoed in
this position in any point in a deal and
 
this position in any point in a deal and
how did you navigate that when maybe you
 
how did you navigate that when maybe you
were seeing things differently than the
 
were seeing things differently than the
CEO you know I think that what ends up
 
CEO you know I think that what ends up
happening when you're in deep into these
 
happening when you're in deep into these
types of things is you've got the CEO
 
types of things is you've got the CEO
you've got the board you've got everyone
 
you've got the board you've got everyone
kind of involved and so it becomes more
 
kind of involved and so it becomes more
of a dialogue collectively and so you
 
of a dialogue collectively and so you
one of the things I try to do is have
 
one of the things I try to do is have
like that role of influence that you
 
like that role of influence that you
know you're you're getting the
 
know you're you're getting the
information you're doing all the
 
information you're doing all the
diligence because that's really one of
 
diligence because that's really one of
the primary roles of the CFO you're you
 
the primary roles of the CFO you're you

a lot and I think it's important to um
 
a lot and I think it's important to um
call out things as you see them you know
 
call out things as you see them you know
and be bringing to the table the risks
 
and be bringing to the table the risks
or bringing to the table the concerns or
 
or bringing to the table the concerns or
whatever it might be because the last
 
whatever it might be because the last
thing you want to do is close the deal
 
thing you want to do is close the deal
and then have the chat you want to talk
 
and then have the chat you want to talk
about it before right we want to go in
 
about it before right we want to go in
Eyes Wide Open you want to have that
 
Eyes Wide Open you want to have that
conversation the hard conversations in
 
conversation the hard conversations in
advance and so I've had many situations
 
advance and so I've had many situations
where that has happened in situations
 
where that has happened in situations
the other thing I'd say that's a really
 
the other thing I'd say that's a really
important thing that I encourage
 
important thing that I encourage
Business Leaders to think about is
 
Business Leaders to think about is
bringing your people partner and your
 
bringing your people partner and your
Finance partner in early like super
 
Finance partner in early like super
early and the reason for that is because
 
early and the reason for that is because
at the end of the day we're going to
 
at the end of the day we're going to
have to live through that complexity but
 
have to live through that complexity but
we also can help you structure it better
 
we also can help you structure it better
we can think about things we can be
 
we can think about things we can be
involved in that discussion I've seen
 
involved in that discussion I've seen
things where like tax wasn't involved
 
things where like tax wasn't involved
early enough because they didn't and
 
early enough because they didn't and
bring in the finance partner and it's
 
bring in the finance partner and it's

financial diligence to make sure we're
 
financial diligence to make sure we're
uncovering we asking all those tough
 
uncovering we asking all those tough
questions we're being involved in kind
 
questions we're being involved in kind
of what that structure of the deal might
 
of what that structure of the deal might
look like all of that yeah are there any
 
look like all of that yeah are there any
skull moments for the audience maybe
 
skull moments for the audience maybe
like that one or two things you either
 
like that one or two things you either
see or hear in your position or don't
 
see or hear in your position or don't
see or hear where you're like we're out
 
see or hear where you're like we're out
this is a red flag any anything like
 
this is a red flag any anything like
that I've seen de where we got to the
 
that I've seen de where we got to the
tech and the tech wasn't necessarily
 
tech and the tech wasn't necessarily
what they thought that that they had you
 
what they thought that that they had you
know positioned it at so that can happen
 
know positioned it at so that can happen
where you just don't feel like it's
 
where you just don't feel like it's
going to be you know worth it I've seen
 
going to be you know worth it I've seen
situations where you're interested in a
 
situations where you're interested in a
company but for whatever reason they're
 
company but for whatever reason they're
not ready and they're having the
 
not ready and they're having the
conversation and they're going through
 
conversation and they're going through
it but you know that that particular
 
it but you know that that particular
founder or that leadership team isn't
 
founder or that leadership team isn't
really ready and are they shopping are
 
really ready and are they shopping are
they trying to get a sense of what that
 
they trying to get a sense of what that
looks like or are they just literally
 
looks like or are they just literally
just um you know just kind of a little
 
just um you know just kind of a little
bit like soul searching on what they
 
bit like soul searching on what they
want to do next and whether they want to
 
want to do next and whether they want to
continue to invest in the business or
 
continue to invest in the business or
whether it is time to move in a
 
whether it is time to move in a
different direction so I think that
 
different direction so I think that
there is a lot of human nature
 
there is a lot of human nature
evaluation through the process because
 
evaluation through the process because
you got to understand motivations you
 
you got to understand motivations you
got to understand interests and you got
 
got to understand interests and you got
to align all that and it all has to work
 
to align all that and it all has to work
and so you know there's situations where
 
and so you know there's situations where
they may they may say well I'm staying
 
they may they may say well I'm staying
on no matter what and there's situations
 
on no matter what and there's situations
where like actually I kind of want to
 
where like actually I kind of want to
gracefully exit and so all of those
 
gracefully exit and so all of those
things have to be considered and as a
 
things have to be considered and as a
buyer you're trying to figure out am i g
 
buyer you're trying to figure out am i g
to I want to make sure that what I take
 
to I want to make sure that what I take
on is going to be successful in the next
 
on is going to be successful in the next
you know several years and so one of the
 
you know several years and so one of the
things I think historically was kind of
 
things I think historically was kind of
popular at the time was kind of earn
 
popular at the time was kind of earn
outs like you have to earn out you know
 
outs like you have to earn out you know
a big portion of that and people have
 
a big portion of that and people have
sort of moved away a little bit from
 
sort of moved away a little bit from
that because then there's an whole
 
that because then there's an whole
argument about did you give me enough
 
argument about did you give me enough
resources to make that earn out did you
 
resources to make that earn out did you
do this to make that so like there's a
 
do this to make that so like there's a
little bit of that Dynamic and challenge
 
little bit of that Dynamic and challenge
that happens with the structure of the
 
that happens with the structure of the
deal but generally there is some level
 
deal but generally there is some level
of kind of triggers or whatever it might
 
of kind of triggers or whatever it might
be but I think that you have to you
 
be but I think that you have to you
really understand the human aspects of
 
really understand the human aspects of
it because you're getting to know
 
it because you're getting to know
whether what that individual leader
 
whether what that individual leader
wants to do in the long run whether they
 
wants to do in the long run whether they
want to stick around what they're what
 
want to stick around what they're what
they want to do and that kind of comes
 
they want to do and that kind of comes
out as part of this process yeah
 
out as part of this process yeah
sometimes changes during the process I
 
sometimes changes during the process I
think it's so important to be aware of
 
think it's so important to be aware of
that and know when it might be time to
 
that and know when it might be time to
stop or walk away because look at how
 
stop or walk away because look at how
long we've talked about this right you
 
long we've talked about this right you
could have two or three of these
 
could have two or three of these
processes going on as far as diligence
 
processes going on as far as diligence
and whatnot oh and by the way your
 
and whatnot oh and by the way your
resource strapped you're growing you're
 
resource strapped you're growing you're

running a business I mean the time it
takes out of an executive team or that
 
takes out of an executive team or that
group Michelle to do this like you could
 
group Michelle to do this like you could
do it fulltime and so I just want to be
 
do it fulltime and so I just want to be
realistic that time balance and those
 
realistic that time balance and those
trade offs are real because it sucks so
 
trade offs are real because it sucks so
much time and usually no one's in charge
 
much time and usually no one's in charge
of it in companies that were trying to
 
of it in companies that were trying to
grow when they're 3400 people so you're
 
grow when they're 3400 people so you're
you're Moonlighting yeah you're doing it
 
you're Moonlighting yeah you're doing it
on the side of your desk especially the
 
on the side of your desk especially the
smaller companies you're doing it on the
 
smaller companies you're doing it on the
side of your desk it is going to crush
 
side of your desk it is going to crush
you because it's going to take over so
 
you because it's going to take over so
much of your time and and you often hear
 
much of your time and and you often hear
people go I just want to run my business
 
people go I just want to run my business
yeah last thing on m&amp;a Michelle is how
 
yeah last thing on m&amp;a Michelle is how

do we make sure key people within the
business stay on post acquisition like
 
business stay on post acquisition like
what is the best way to structure those
 
what is the best way to structure those
sorts of deals because to your point
 
sorts of deals because to your point
there's the earnout which has some
 
there's the earnout which has some
tradeoffs but but so does like the just
 
tradeoffs but but so does like the just
the date of just like hey stay here for
 
the date of just like hey stay here for
two years because then you could just be
 
two years because then you could just be
resting in like how do you think about
 
resting in like how do you think about
that it's a tough one because you almost
 
that it's a tough one because you almost
have to go into it uh
 
have to go into it uh
recognizing how much of a transition you
 
recognizing how much of a transition you
really need and if that person doesn't
 
really need and if that person doesn't
want to stick on in the long run what's
 
want to stick on in the long run what's
important amount of time to be
 
important amount of time to be
successful so you know how much time do
 
successful so you know how much time do
we need to get full knowledge transfer
 
we need to get full knowledge transfer
or to get a successor named or to get
 
or to get a successor named or to get
whatever you need to do to structure
 
whatever you need to do to structure
that to make it make sense and so what I
 
that to make it make sense and so what I
have seen historically is you're you're
 
have seen historically is you're you're
balancing some level of a retention
 
balancing some level of a retention
structure right where you're giving
 
structure right where you're giving
someone a reason to stay that's material
 
someone a reason to stay that's material
enough that they won't they they're not
 
enough that they won't they they're not
going to go but doing it not so long
 
going to go but doing it not so long
that it is over that they've gotten to a
 
that it is over that they've gotten to a
point where they're not may maybe saving
 
point where they're not may maybe saving
contributing or adding value in that
 
contributing or adding value in that
structure so finding that balance
 
structure so finding that balance
between the two is an important one and
 
between the two is an important one and
something that I think is heavily
 
something that I think is heavily
debated in a process one last topic for
 
debated in a process one last topic for
me noan just transitioning Michelle to
 
me noan just transitioning Michelle to
