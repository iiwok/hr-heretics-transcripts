all right Michelle Weaver thank you so
much for joining us today on HR Heretics
I have known Michelle since 2016 or 2017
no I think 2016 when we first
interviewed you or started talking to
you at hired she has been a great friend
mentor and colleague ever since she is a
boss in the tech industry CFO career
starting with gap amazing brand on to EA
for about seven years and then has been
I think a four-time CFO after that at
Axiom Stitch fix back in the Heyday on
to hired where we got her and then on to
now twitch which is now a part of Amazon
so quite quite the story quite the
career and we're just so excited to talk
with you today thank you for being here
thank you for having me it's always a
pleasure Kelly and I go way back and
always had a lot of fun working together
so when this opportunity came arise I I
was jumping right at it so thank you
yeah I think I remember the first
meeting Michelle at hired Nolan I think
it was maybe eight or nine months before
you started and may was like I think we
can get her I worked with her at axom
like let me let me just talk to her she
came in I don't even think we even
talked about work we were just like we
can't work with fake people what is this
whole thing and it just took off from
there and some of the best best years
working with you had hired so yeah super
fun lots of stories oh yeah okay so I'm
gonna jump in I think you know my my
biggest first question I guess uh
Michelle is you are one of the most
human yet like technically astute CFOs
I've worked with like this is someone
that's this this Perfect Blend of like a
human first leader that's just a WI is
with all the things around the business
and I just is that was that intentional
how did you think about that early on
how did you hone that part of it because
I haven't worked with a lot of CFOs with
that level of of humanity and their
leadership it's interesting because I
think it comes down to just who I am as
a person and at the end of the day like
I I want to treat others as I want to
treat myself and so like I want to be
treated well and I want others to have a
human really good experience in in
business and as a leader I grew up with
just a lot of good role modeling in the
family and then just went through a lot
of personal Challenge and overcame a lot
of different things that I think make me
better as a leader because I'm just I'm
more in touch with how people are
feeling what they're going through and
so at the end of the day we're here to
drive the business we're here to make
business results and here to add
shareholder value but we're also working
together as people every single day and
we want to be treated well and at the
end of the day to me I want to be that
type of leader that's going to be you
know authentic empathetic that's going
to understand what where people are
coming from and approach the business in
that same way and so you know I think
the best thing I'd say about this is
that early on all of us find out what
bad is in management we've all had that
experience where it's like I don't want
to be that because I didn't feel good
sitting on the other side of that and
that's not what I want to be and so
sometimes you have to go through that
pretty early in your career to realize
what you want to take from that
situation what you don't want to be and
what you want to be as a leader and so I
think that that happening early in a
career can be really powerful for people
and setting them on the right path
that's you stole my line I always say
you learn more from Bad managers than
you do from good and my my first manager
at Google who I hope doesn't listen to
the Pod was terrible and I learned so
much about what not to do that it helps
shape what I do and how I want to manage
and how I want to be perceived by my
team speaking of let's talk about your
team a little bit how do how do you
think about building your team how do
you manage your team I think we're in an
era right now to where there's a lot of
talk around oh well we you know let's
just have flatter organizations less
hierarchy more doers less
managers you know but how do you remain
human in a time in which right now all
of the pressure is on you to be like
well just manage more people and maybe
you don't need to do one-on ones and
maybe you don't need to care about your
team's career
trajectory it's a great great question
and we're in a really unusual time and
just the industries and just what's been
going on and so um you
know even with the changes in the
organization structures right and the
dynamic of the teams looking differently
it doesn't I I do not sway away from the
importance of oneto ones on talking to
your team on interactions on development
all of that now I would say the the
world has changed a little bit in terms
of what does development look like now
right for years it used to be people
used to define development as I want to
get promoted I want to be I want to move
up into an organization and with maybe
flatter organizations or just the
reality of the business landscape today
sometimes those the opportunities for
growth and learning are not necessarily
with getting that promotion but in
learning across the organization and
learning across on projects and so I
spent a lot of time trying to bring in
topics that are relevant to the team
that might be interesting bringing in
leaders from other functions to talk to
the team because at the end of the day
if you know more about the business in
all functions of the business not just
wearing your Finance hat your tax hat
your accounting hat or whatever function
you might sit in even in the people team
like being able to be well rounded and
understanding all aspects of the
business makes you a better stronger
contributor to the organization even in
the company you're in today or in the
companies you're going to go to in the
future so for me it's a lot about
opportunities for development and growth
in different ways than maybe it was
traditionally in the past yeah so let's
let's take a beat on that so Kelly and I
have talked recently about promotion
Obsession and I would say promotion
Obsession was like the thing from 2012
basically through 2021
and we were in a labor constrained
market and so employees who weren't
getting promoted were like all right
peace out I'm going to go get my
promotion through another job at another
company now the labor market has flipped
there's a ton of great people that are
currently on the market and what I keep
hearing from operators internally is
that there is more scrutiny and pressure
being applied to internal promotions are
you guys seeing the same thing I hear it
but I don't necessarily think that I've
changed my standards or that I have had
a different kind of a level of of kind
of approach to how I'm I'm handling
promotion so I would say the flat
organizations mean less opportunity
right because at the end of the day I
think it has to be two things you have
to be ready for the promotion and there
has to be an available position for that
promotion and we don't want to just kind
of have structures where all levels rise
up and then you end up with just a bunch
of senior Folks at the end of the day it
doesn't really work and that's not
really a great leadership experience for
that individual so I think that while I
hear there is more scrutiny and
certainly there's less maybe
opportunity I don't think I've wavered
in kind of like what I would approach as
the standards for getting to that
promotion and what that looks like and
so I think it's personal I think it
depends on what that Leader's approaches
to the business and what that looks like
but in my situations I think we are
still leaning in on our top talent and
people that we think have high potential
to get them to that next level we care
deeply about that is there less opportun
for it yes hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our

heretic Cent
[Music]
you let's let's talk a little bit about
that Talent man management piece and
specifically like how you and the chief
people officer work together on that so
what does what does that look like over
the course of your career and then how
has that
evolved so the talent leader and the
finance leader are kind of lock step
right like you really are operating at
building kind of the structure the cost
structure the kind of the processes
within the company so it becomes really
really important Kelly and I were like
literally like in all day working
together in our situation when she was
CPO and I was CFO because at the end of
the day um most of the companies their
largest cost is their people cost right
and so we're spending a lot of time
understanding like comp compensation
we're hiring practices we're
understanding kind of how we performance
manage together What's the culture we're
trying to build what's the strategy of
the company what skills are we missing
in the organization what skills do we
want to develop and get all of that kind
of builds together and so
um over the years what I would say is
that you know one of the things that has
become more real to me is that early in
my career and I'm I'm G to not reveal my
age but you can check it out when you
look at my LinkedIn because I'm I've
been around it was a lot more
transactional like years ago like we
were just kind of doing these processes
and making them happen and and doing all
that I think what's changed over the
years is it's become more strategic
right the people role the finance role
were really involved in the setting the
company Strat strategy and being more
having a seat at the table to that and I
think that's something I stri for I
think Kelly you do that as well like
it's just really being a part of that
and guiding it it yeah I mean it cannot
be separate planets it it literally at
Peak Performance these two functions are
a ven diagram and the more they overlap
the the better in that sense and we've
talked about it before in different
episodes and you you hited to it as far
as Michelle understanding the whole
landscape like it's not enough anymore
to be your numbers and I'm people and we
talk when we need to it's like no like
you need to understand what's what's
going and these functions Al almost need
to be
interchangeable in a lot of ways
especially at that sea Suite table and
providing that united front that
holistic View and I'd love to talk about
like when that when that is happening
and that magic is real you can influence
the direction of the company right you
influence the CEO together your Pres
presenting things that you could not
present alone at that table and I guess
I'll ask what does that look like and
feel like when it's working at Peak like
any stories or learnings or things that
happened or did not happen because it
wasn't there in your just amazing career
first and then second any advice for
listeners on how they can build this
relationship with their
CFO one of the best ways I think that
people team and the finance team work
collaboratively and together is when it
comes to aligning performance to the
performance of the company right and so
at the end of the day like we're here to
drive shareholder value we're here to
grow the business we're here to get to
those financial results but if you as
the people leader and me as the finance
leader if we come together and we're
thinking about do we have the right
incentives in place is the structure for
our organization working that we're
getting the best business results as a
result of what we're doing to design the
programs and the practices and the
structure to align to that and I think
that's when it can be really magical
like Kelly you and I worked together
when we've had issues on maybe the way
our sales and go to market strategy is
happening and knowing that that's
changing and going well you know what
the way we've been doing the
compensation before doesn't really align
to where we're taking the company and
what worked in the past isn't always
going to work with what's coming forward
and so what do we need to do to
structurally change that and what do we
need to do to kind of create the right
in incentives and create the right
structure so that our teams are winning
we're winning we've got the right kind
of movement and momentum in the business
so you know I see a lot of companies
pivoting into do you know new business
strategies new um Ventures inside their
own business and that takes a lot of
good work on the finance and the people
side to say well how do we set that
compensation structure up for that part
of that business to be really successful
in the future and what do we need to do
to make that win yeah the other thing I
think I remember that that we did really
well together and should happen in every
company I was talking to a group
yesterday about it is you're literally
managing the shape and the flow of this
company And the tagline is workforce
planning fine but in these high growth
Venture you know startups and and the
pressure and the change if you don't
have a handle on kind of the es and
flows and how this company's expanding
Contracting who's coming in what type of
talent what level how does that connect
to the finance side the people say you
can get out of whack really quickly and
it causes Panic it puts speed bumps in
the business and it just slows things
down and so that proactive workforce
planning and how is this thing moving
what is it going to look like 12 months
from now because if it gets out of whack
we know it takes six months to fix that
yeah I I can tell you I've seen plenty
of stories where um you get ahead of
your skis and folks are not really like
managing to that head count correctly
and it's not aligned
and then all of a sudden you're in a
position of like well what are we going
to do about this right and that's not
the place you want to be like that's
just not the place lopsided it's like
that's the place the whole industry is
in right now interestingly enough like
that's kind of where we've been for the
last two years you you said something
that I I hear all the time but when I
hear it I think most people think about
it negatively you said people is the
most important expense in a
business and when I hear people talk
about it they kind of like view that
negatively because it's like oh like we
don't want to be an expense but it's
just objectively true like if you look
at the p&amp;l and you look at where spend
is going headcount is the number one
expense and the other thing I'm
realizing from this conversation is like
one of my best friends at CA was Charlie
kers who's the
CFO and you guys are Illuminating an
insight for me that a lot of the change
that I made in the first two years that
I was there was because I was actually
working with first and I was greasing
the wheels with Charlie on why I wanted
to do this why I wanted to Institute a
program how it would impact the business
and then me and Charlie would together
go to Henry who was our CEO at the time
and so I think one of the insights I'm
getting from you guys is you know Kelly
we talked a lot about Chief people
officers how they should interview CEOs
I don't think we've ever talked about
how important it is for the chief people
officer to interview the
CFO and vice versa for the CFO to be
interviewing the chief people officer
because if there is a problem with that
relationship you can't get anything
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done in the business that that
that is more detrimental to the business
than a bad or an unhealthy relationship
with the CEO if the CPO and the CFO have
a strong relationship you can still do
well in spite of a CEO usually and that
relationship is so important because
because they touch everything the CEO
kind of doesn't touch everything the CFO
and the CPO they are literally in the
bowels of the organization left and
right dayto day the things they do
impact everything the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people see
and touch and feel and everything the
top and the bottom line sees and touches
and feels and that can really screw you
up you got to build a tight relationship
there it's too critical and you got to
have trust you got to have like kind of
respect there because you're not going
to always get along like you're not
going to always have alignment but you
got to know that these are people you
can work with that when you do have
conflict or it is a challenge that you
kind of set aside your own personal
agenda and you're kind of focused in on
what's right for the business and you're
making a good call together yeah I have
a I have a question Michelle these
companies you've been a part of have
been incredible right the the brands the
pedigree the outcomes just the growth
how did you pick these companies we talk
a lot about how do you interview a
Founder CEO how do you know it's the
right thing and then second we've talked
a lot about a lot of chro don't even
know how to ask astute business metric
questions around what the right company
is to join from the health the
trajectory these number types of
questions to size up a company so two
things how do you choose the right place
from the person and what questions do
you ask to see if this is a worthwhile
company to join from a financial
perspective you know it's so interesting
because I think think of it as in like
two dimensions on the one dimension
whenever I'm choosing a company it's
about the business it's that's table
Stakes to me like do I believe in this
as a business that I think is going
somewhere that I have faith in that I
think is going to do well and I really
approach that almost like I'm an
investor like I'm going into that kind
of saying I'm an investor and I'm going
to evaluate that like as if I'm an
investor like what's the problem what's
the solution what are the key product
features what's the product fit or how
do they fit into the landscape what are
the fin Cal look like what does the
trajectory of the business look like
what are the projections you know what's
a funding situation am I going to have
to walk into a place and have to like
immediately raise cash or is it well
funded and then you know that gives you
a solid sense of the of the business
right it gives you a sense of how that
business is going to do and you really
want to approach it that way but I would
say that's one dimension the other
dimension which I think is so important
is that team like is this a team that
you believe in that that has proven
track record of success like when things
get tough is this a team that's going to
work with me not against me someone
that's going to have a foundation of
trust and respect and someone I'm going
to work with and and it's hard in an
interview to get at that it really is
and the reason I say that is because
it's we all know that when you get into
the tough situations that's you know
that's how you see how people handle
adversity and you don't always know how
they're going to act when you're going
into an interview situation on both
sides right and so the only advice I the
couple things that advice that I I give
to folks is that you know you can't
fully test for the values or when what's
going to happen when the going gets
tough but you can talk about Stories the
stories you've had the stories you've
been through and get insights in that
discussion what happens when this
happens or what about this situation
when it didn't go right or it didn't go
well and just listen see how they
respond in that moment because it gives
you a good indication
as to what that person's going to be
like when you're in the trenches
together and so I encourage folks to use
storytelling and talk about situations
in the interview process to give you
those insights I also say do your
diligence right like I've been
approached about roles where the CFO had
not lasted long well I wonder why right
and what I don't know about that is I
don't have any insights into that so
sometimes just tapping into your own
network making a few calls finding out
what's going on we all know the world's
so connected right you can quickly find
out like whether what was really going
on in that situation just to give you
that Insight because you don't want to
walk into a similar situation and have
it not work you want to be really
successful go in eyes wide open but in
the end like you know you could do your
business evaluation you can meet these
people and get to know them you got to
go with your intuition and your gut like
at the end of the day like you got to
trust yourself in making those right
calls do we always get it right no but
you got to go with that because I think
at the end of the day as Business
Leaders intuition gut judgment they all
matter so I want to talk about twitch
specifically because I think twitch is
such an interesting business to me as
like a you know quasi gamer the idea of
the business of like you know you're
recording yourself and broadcasting that
like I I am in the generation that's
beyond like why would I watch someone
else play video games when I would
rather be playing video
games that one for me I'm still trying
to wrap my head around but it's an
obvious Grand Slam business that is
killing it acquired by Amazon so when
you're going through that process in
 
and how you evaluated that
business wow okay that's the interesting
thing about this situation is that I had
roots in gaming right I came from
Electronic Arts I had a lot of history
and understanding just how big that
business could be and understanding kind
of the landscape right that landscape is
you know it's entertainment it's a huge
piece of a new found kind of area in the
space and so I immediately had a lot of
connection to that because I understood
that space and I understood what was
going on there but what is interesting
is that at the time when I was talking
to Twitch um a cultural phenomena was
happening fortnite right I mean this was
was a time in in the gaming landscape
where a lot of new Gamers were coming
into the fold right casual gamers Gamers
that had maybe not been interested in
that hardcore you know sector before
were kind of coming into it and it
became really obvious to me that coupled
with some other industry trends that
were happening at the time like you saw
people you know the classic sit in your
living room and watch entertainment
together to now let's go online and
you're in your living room and I'm in my
living room and we're going to have a
chat together and have a community
together and talk about the show that
we're watching together we don't have to
be in the pH you know the same space And
so there's this Dynamic that was
happening around Community Building
finding your people online being a part
of that as well as just the phenomena of
the space and gaming and the growth that
was happening naturally that kind of
became a good you know a perfect kind of
mix for me when I was looking at this
business opportunity and I think
that when I was a talking to to the
business I also saw so much opportunity
for us to be Innovative in how we might
monetize this space and what that might
look like over time so it was just a
really unique moment in time and I just
feel like that the entertainment
landscape is continued to change quite a
bit but you know at that time when I was
talking to them that it was definitely
this emergence of gaming new Gamers into
the space as well as just this idea
about bringing people together in a
community and that transcended really
well during covid when a lot of people
were looking to to to find people online
to find people totally it was just it
was a natural fit okay let's so let's
talk about m&amp;a and then the experience
that you've had in your career with m&amp;a
because it's happening a lot right now
as companies are getting towards the end
of their Runway they're getting into
these positions of m&amp;a feels like an
option for them so talk us through what
you've seen in m&amp;a in your career it's
an interesting and hypercharged kind of
fun activity to go through as a business
typically what I seen is businesses in
an interest of understanding whether
they want to build something or whether
they want to buy something and what that
tradeoff looks like in terms of
acceleration into their space whether
it's adding another you know kind of
complimentary business that is going to
be one plus one is three or whether it's
going to be something that kind of
compliments or is a great Synergy
opportunity whatever that might be you
look around the valley there's been some
very large Acquisitions that have been
very additive to some of the bigger
companies in the valley that have been
amazing for them and have been additive
into their term the long-term structure
of the company and a longterm
opportunity what's interesting about m&amp;a
is
that it's under a ton of scrutiny right
because there's been a lot more legal
scrutiny and just like you know
governmental scrutiny than ever before
because I think that the Tech Industries
just continued to get big and big and
that becomes a little bit more
challenging what I often tell folks like
one of the things that you see when
you're in a company and someone's young
in their career they're so excited about
this m&amp;a deal I'm I'm working on this
deal I'm so excited about it and I'm
like I always want to get people
grounded most of these deals if not the
vast majority of these deals will not
make it through right and so don't get
over
 
move on from that I've seen this a lot
and it's a hypothesis it could be right
or wrong but a lot of founder CEOs that
are younger they're very ambitious
they're energetic they almost get
wrapped up in the chase like at some
point it it doesn't even become about is
the deal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good for us or not I
just want to get it now because we're in
it and I'm just so amped up and it
becomes about closing it and getting it
even if I might not be the right thing
so I I've seen that a few times and I
just want to know if that's me or off or
well I think once you start telling
yourself a story I I think this is
Michelle it's such a great point
because if you get into an m&amp;a process
as a human you just start to imagine
yourself at that company your product
working in that company the potential
liquidity you will see from that event
and you've already like started living
in the new world and then you're like
pot committed because you're living in
the new world and when it doesn't work
it can be majorly deflating being
grounded is such great advice I just
want to highlight it because it's and
it's very hard to do because we're
humans yeah there is so much emotion
wrapped up in it because folks are
caring about I think the financial
outcome a lot and they're also caring
about their personal brand what is it
going to do for me and sometimes they
get so caught up in it Kelly to your
point that they're caring more about
what happens for themselves than they
might be for what's happening for the
business and in sitting in the CFO hat
it's my role to be that person that's
kind of doing the checks and balances
that's kind of saying does this make
sense does this look right so it's
important to be really thinking in that
Dimension and sometimes you'll find that
the course of a deal changes from the
beginning to the end right you might
start the conversation thinking that it
makes sense for the founder or the CEO
of that company to stay on you might
change that view by the end of the deal
or vice versa and that can be very
emotionally challenging and you have to
have a lot of kind of self-awareness and
you have to have a lot of kind grounding
in those moments to be able to kind of
work your way through it yeah in your in
your role right as CFO have you ever had
those moments where you know we're here
to support the CEO we're here to work
with them Etc have you ever just been
like look this isn't happening or this
is happening have you ever vetoed in
this position in any point in a deal and
how did you navigate that when maybe you
were seeing things differently than the
CEO you know I think that what ends up
happening when you're in deep into these
types of things is you've got the CEO
you've got the board you've got everyone
kind of involved and so it becomes more
of a dialogue collectively and so you
one of the things I try to do is have
like that role of influence that you
know you're you're getting the
information you're doing all the
diligence because that's really one of
the primary roles of the CFO you're you
know you're involved in the financials
and you're also looking at the diligence
of the deal in partnership with the CPO
a lot and I think it's important to um
call out things as you see them you know
and be bringing to the table the risks
or bringing to the table the concerns or
whatever it might be because the last
thing you want to do is close the deal
and then have the chat you want to talk
about it before right we want to go in
Eyes Wide Open you want to have that
conversation the hard conversations in
advance and so I've had many situations
where that has happened in situations
the other thing I'd say that's a really
important thing that I encourage
Business Leaders to think about is
bringing your people partner and your
Finance partner in early like super
early and the reason for that is because
at the end of the day we're going to
have to live through that complexity but
we also can help you structure it better
we can think about things we can be
involved in that discussion I've seen
things where like tax wasn't involved
early enough because they didn't and
bring in the finance partner and it's
like that can be very complicated and so
being involved early is another piece of
advice I think is important during mmaa
deals because uh they can be really
valuable of course your lawyer your your
Finance leader and your people leader
need to be really locked step Along with
whoever the business Advocate is than
the CEO and bringing that Trifecta
together is
important I've been on the buy side once
but it was more of like a distress sale
can you just walk us through like the
step
of like if you're on the the acquirer
side what is that what are the steps of
m&amp;a and like how does that process
work so it can be an organic one in
which you've already identified a Target
right or someone that you're interested
in or it could be that they came to you
because they are interested in getting
bought sometimes you get involved with
investors or Bankers or other people to
help you in identifying Escape place
like I'm interested in this and I need
some help I'm kind of vetting it but
once you get to a place where you know
the interesting party right the party
you're interested in it's a level of
diligence that happens that's kind of
we're getting to know each other it's
that investor pitch thing we talked
about earlier in the cycle talk to me
about your product talk to me about what
you have your team all of the dimensions
that we discussed earlier that are
really important and it's then kind of
entering in a relationship where you're
learning you're listening you're
assessing kind of validating on the back
end going okay is this something that we
want to pursue um then you kind of start
to price gauge you know what would it
take if this were to happen what does it
look like if this were to happen you
know how might we look Envision this and
these are still really early
conversations because you want to get a
sense of what that looks like then you
kind of say well I'm interested enough I
want some more diligence let's sign an
NDA let's get into that conversation so
then you're in a discussion point where
you're sharing information back and
forth you might be setting up a some
level of diligence and then at some
point you're crossing the chasm to
negotiations and to place where you have
an initial term sheet and then you're
going deep into diligence that next
stage is really deep into diligence
where you're really hoping to uncover
everything right you're getting in there
you're looking at the teams you're
understanding the financials you're
vetting the product most important you
got to vet that product because that's
ultimately you know in a lot of cases
especially it's it's software what what
you're buying and you want to understand
how important that is so there's so much
involved in kind of Crossing each of
these steps and feeling confident to
continue that process through and in my
particular role I'm helping on the
financial diligence to make sure we're
uncovering we asking all those tough
questions we're being involved in kind
of what that structure of the deal might
look like all of that yeah are there any
skull moments for the audience maybe
like that one or two things you either
see or hear in your position or don't
see or hear where you're like we're out
this is a red flag any anything like
that I've seen de where we got to the
tech and the tech wasn't necessarily
what they thought that that they had you
know positioned it at so that can happen
where you just don't feel like it's
going to be you know worth it I've seen
situations where you're interested in a
company but for whatever reason they're
not ready and they're having the
conversation and they're going through
it but you know that that particular
founder or that leadership team isn't
really ready and are they shopping are
they trying to get a sense of what that
looks like or are they just literally
just um you know just kind of a little
bit like soul searching on what they
want to do next and whether they want to
continue to invest in the business or
whether it is time to move in a
different direction so I think that
there is a lot of human nature
evaluation through the process because
you got to understand motivations you
got to understand interests and you got
to align all that and it all has to work
and so you know there's situations where
they may they may say well I'm staying
on no matter what and there's situations
where like actually I kind of want to
gracefully exit and so all of those
things have to be considered and as a
buyer you're trying to figure out am i g
to I want to make sure that what I take
on is going to be successful in the next
you know several years and so one of the
things I think historically was kind of
popular at the time was kind of earn
outs like you have to earn out you know
a big portion of that and people have
sort of moved away a little bit from
that because then there's an whole
argument about did you give me enough
resources to make that earn out did you
do this to make that so like there's a
little bit of that Dynamic and challenge
that happens with the structure of the
deal but generally there is some level
of kind of triggers or whatever it might
be but I think that you have to you
really understand the human aspects of
it because you're getting to know
whether what that individual leader
wants to do in the long run whether they
want to stick around what they're what
they want to do and that kind of comes
out as part of this process yeah
sometimes changes during the process I
think it's so important to be aware of
that and know when it might be time to
stop or walk away because look at how
long we've talked about this right you
could have two or three of these
processes going on as far as diligence
and whatnot oh and by the way your
resource strapped you're growing you're
running a business I mean the time it
takes out of an executive team or that
group Michelle to do this like you could
do it fulltime and so I just want to be
realistic that time balance and those
trade offs are real because it sucks so
much time and usually no one's in charge
of it in companies that were trying to
grow when they're 3400 people so you're
you're Moonlighting yeah you're doing it
on the side of your desk especially the
smaller companies you're doing it on the
side of your desk it is going to crush
you because it's going to take over so
much of your time and and you often hear
people go I just want to run my business
yeah last thing on m&amp;a Michelle is how
do we make sure key people within the
business stay on post acquisition like
what is the best way to structure those
sorts of deals because to your point
there's the earnout which has some
tradeoffs but but so does like the just
the date of just like hey stay here for
two years because then you could just be
resting in like how do you think about
that it's a tough one because you almost
have to go into it uh
recognizing how much of a transition you
really need and if that person doesn't
want to stick on in the long run what's
important amount of time to be
successful so you know how much time do
we need to get full knowledge transfer
or to get a successor named or to get
whatever you need to do to structure
that to make it make sense and so what I
have seen historically is you're you're
balancing some level of a retention
structure right where you're giving
someone a reason to stay that's material
enough that they won't they they're not
going to go but doing it not so long
that it is over that they've gotten to a
point where they're not may maybe saving
contributing or adding value in that
structure so finding that balance
between the two is an important one and
something that I think is heavily
debated in a process one last topic for
me noan just transitioning Michelle to
this concept of burnout right we've had
a lot going on the last few years we've
talked a lot about this with others we
have a similar type of timeline in this
industry you know know larger companies
earlier on and then the last 14 15 years
CFO CPO four times over do you think
this whole notion of I'm burned out and
I'm tired is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what do you think
about that how do you keep going there's
this phenomenon out there that
everyone's tired it's a lot and you just
seem to keep going the coals seem to be
hot so would love your reaction to that
you know I think it's just so personal
it's a question for that individual and
you got to ask yourself that often
because sometimes people need a break
you know you got to recharge the
batteries and sometimes recharging the
batteries is taking a space and a break
and taking yourself out of that vicious
cycle and getting getting some
perspective but for others you know it
you know it could be that um maybe this
the role you're in is something you're
not feeling challenged or learning and
growing in and you kind of have to ask
yourself that because when we're
learning and growing and we're feeling
feeling stretched we tend to really
enjoy it like as individuals I mean but
personally I can speak to that like if
you got something that's kind of
interesting and keeping you awake at
night that you like God this is I'm so
intellectually stimulated by this or
curious about something it it doesn't
feel like burn burnout it feels like
kind of like good good solid challenge
but often times it takes leaders to be
and I respect them when they do this to
get to a position where they're like I
think it's time for me to hand over the
Reigns that I don't you know I think
someone else could be in a better
position to to take this one forward and
you know we have to often remember
because I think this is important too
it's not always running away from
something as it is running to something
you might actually love your job and a
lot of times people do they love what
they're doing they love the gig they're
in but then someone in their Network
talks to them about something and it
Sparks that interest and it gets them so
excited that they want to do that and
they want to go pursue that and if you
are running towards something you know
it kind of re-energizes you in a way
that is you know it's hard to put words
around yeah so I think it's about making
sure you're learning and growing taking
space for yourself take a break if you
need it and being real about like
whether it's time for you to be in a
different position or in a different
place yeah I love that my my two
takeaways from that and two things that
I I kind of didn't do enough to be
honest is one giving yourself the
permission to ask yourself that often I
think we just kind of get in these modes
and then you find yourself in a spot and
then second is is realizing that it's
not that you're burned out on working
maybe it's just the stuff you were doing
and it was time for a pivot and a shift
that's awesome thank you yeah for me I
I've spent a lot of time reflecting on
this because I'm in that zone right now
in my career to where like I'm working
seven days a week not for the sake of
hustle porn because like I'm just
thoroughly enjoying what I'm doing
and it's almost like we've demonized it
in our culture like I'm not allowed to
like talk about those things online
because other people who aren't
stimulated and aren't growing in their
roles can't even wrap their heads around
what it's like to be in love with your
job and I just go back to my own
personal childhood my dad unfortunately
hated his job and all he could talk
about throughout my entire childhood was
retirement and so the story I told
myself was like I'm working to retire
and I had to rewire my brain once I
started to get really stimulated in my
role because I was like demonizing my
own self yes I think it's so common
though Nolan like if we if we family
feuded this thing and asked 100 people
like do you think positive or negative
when you hear the word job
yeah survey says I would say 80 out of
 
where we are privileged like the of us I
think are are very privileged yeah to
have had
opportunities to solve really hard
business problems that stretch us that's
stuff that we haven't seen before and
that like you know to your point
Michelle of what you said which is so
true because this happens to me all the
time I like I'll wake up in the middle
of the night with an idea and I just
like have to write that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down and
I'm like not mad at myself for having
the idea I'm like this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
awesome like I'm having a blast doing
this
and I you know my my true hope for our
audience is to to truly love what you're
doing and to have that experience
because I don't know about you Michelle
but for me it's the most addicting drug
on the planet business is the most
addicting drug on the planet and I I
like when you're in it it's super fun
and I'm assuming that's the case with
you yeah I mean at the end of the day we
spend so many of our waking hours if you
think of it at just working that you got
love what you do and you got to have fun
with it and I think that that um that's
why sometimes when I I'm looking at the
Next Generation I've got one in college
and one in high school right now and I'm
looking at them and I'm like I just want
them to find that passion that fire
whatever it is like just and it doesn't
have to be in business it could be
whatever it is I'm just I'm hopeful that
they can find something that they can
learn and grow from and it excites them
every day U because it won't feel like
work just to take a beat on that were
you passionate about Finance like were
you just like this is the because I i'
I've spent a lot of time thinking about
this but like my sister and I have this
conversation all the time and I wasn't
passionate about recruiting and people
before I got into it I became passionate
as I got into it and I'm curious what
was that experience like for you so I'll
laugh because I have always been numbers
oriented so from a very early stage like
I always had a passion for numbers and
seeing things so you know like I loved I
love to go in a room and look at a chart
and see the issue one of my favorite
stories was interviewing with a CEO and
a board member at a private small
company and I said well I'd love to see
the like the last board deck and or an
investor deck or whatever so they put it
up on a screen and we're looking there
and I'm kind of looking at the screen
and I kind of looked at it and I said
you know that that doesn't add up and
they looked at me and they go what do
you mean it doesn't add up we just show
this to our investors and I said well
can you check the last two columns there
and they looked at me and they couldn't
believe it and they were like oh my gosh
it doesn't add up and so Inc yeah so it
was one of those moments where I
probably could have gotten hired on the
spot for that job but I wasn't
interested and I you know for a hostal
reasons it didn't work out but I have a
passion for numbers I've always liked
numbers but I think what I like most
about numbers and this is what kind of
became my thing early
when I was in Middle School and into
high school is why behind it so for me
like I grew up and I'm going to date
myself but like why were we lined up to
get gas during the OPEC oil crisis like
why were there not enough Cabbage Patch
dolls and I never got one and I'm still
not happy about it I have an authentic
antique right here next to me on the
Shelf I I think I'm going to need to
borrow it for a month so I can say I had
one okay it's in the Box love it but
that's what I cared about was
understanding the why and getting behind
the why because that just to me like I
don't I W understand and that was basic
economic Concepts exactly that was
Supply demand that was understanding the
businesses that was the fact that I went
and chose the Gap because I remember
when they opened the first Gap Kids in
my mall and it was like I joined that
business it was only doing $700 million
it was a small company back then and
when I left it was like a $16 billion
company and I grew in that 10 years in
that company and I saw that whole thing
go go and so from my perspective early
on I like numbers but early on I like to
know why and I just was one of those
kids that just asked a lot of the
questions and so for whatever reason now
it did also help that like you know
probably in my stocking in eth grade was
like an HP 12C and and my family was
encouraging me to do that so I had like
a financial calculator and a grade and
you know I still do have my financial
calculator so I I Aspire for my children
to find their passion as early as you
did because I I think for most people
it's not that case it's like you know
they're kind of searching and trying to
figure it out and then you know in my
case I just got dropped into something
and I fell in love with it and so I I
Aspire for my kids to find it that early
because when you do and you go super
deep look at your career and look at
what can happen yeah yeah and I also
encourage folks folks that like I kind
of like to say like it's
not it's not a one-way door when you
make your choices in your career I
talked to my kids and they were like
well I think I'll major in this or I'll
think I'll major in that and I said
listen it doesn't matter if you go down
a path and you explore it and you can't
figure it out like it's okay pivot like
the end of the day like we all know
life's this like crazy Journey we're all
on and I've had plenty plenty of my ups
and downs on the personal front on the
professional front you just have to kind
of stay committed to yourself and
committed to kind of growth and if that
has to go a different path it's okay and
so we happen to be ones that got into
the career and stayed in it and kind of
grew and it's morphing it's all I mean
look at the the two of you have this
great new business thing you've got
going here I love it but it is not
everyone's gon to have that and I think
it's okay and it's also en encouraging
to talk to your kids and to talk to even
my teammates about that one of my best
stories was having someone on my team
helping them pivot helping them realize
that they were really good at one really
area that they should go pursue and to
this day I'm I'm so happy that they
found it because they're really really
happy in their life now and they that
change was um important and so if I
could help guide people in that
direction or if I can be a you know an
advocate for them to to encourage change
I would love to be known for that in my
career love it Michelle this was
incredible thank you so much for joining
us can't wait for this one to air HR
