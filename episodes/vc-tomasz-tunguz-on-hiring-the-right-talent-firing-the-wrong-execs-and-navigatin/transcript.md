# VC Tomasz Tunguz on Hiring the Right Talent, Firing the Wrong Execs, and Navigating M&As

## Transcript

 
there's this awesome Venture quote
startups would be easy if it weren't for
the people most challenges inside of a
company are having to deal with people
and it's just about getting the right
chemistry to work what are the things
that you see hear feel real time in
boardrooms it's an incredible time to be
a young and upand cominging leader
because the opportunities you will be
afforded may never happen again that's
such a unique lens from an investor I
found that the prevailing wisdom was
like actually you should hire somebody
who's been there and done that my
favorite question in a refence
is I'll ask about a person's strengths
and then instead of asking about
weaknesses the way I like to frame it is
what kinds of people does this person
need around them to be
[Applause]

successful hey everyone welcome back to
the HR Heretics podcast where we get
into the real talk of company
Construction these are the conversations
that happened between Founders Chief
people officers and board members behind
closed doors we're Heretics in this
industry because there's a culture of
Silence around important business topics
especially with people but on the show
we tell the truth and expect the same
from our guests today we're excited to
bring you a conversation with Tom tangus
Tom is the general partner at Theory
Ventures which he founded in 2022 before
that Tom was a well-known General
partner at Redo for 14 years where he
made investments in the likes of looker
and we're closely with our own Kelly
dragovic I am so stoked for you to hear
is Bor room perspective and an inside
look at Google's acquisition of looker
Tom is one of the smartest people in
Venture a statement that will come is no
surprise since so many of us read his
newsletter and he has a lot to say about
what the future has in store for company
structure as well as Talent last week
listeners told us that our segment about
exec terminations was really valuable so
stay tuned after Tom's interview for
another short segment where Kelly and I
dig into how we think about political
discussions at work how each of us are
navigating it and how you should think
about navigating it at your company now
onto our conversation with Tom tungus
Tom thanks so much for coming on you had
an article last year called Soft in the-
middle which I think was a little before
its time you write about spanic control
which is The Rao of managers to doers
and suggests that now might be the time
to squeeze the middle and eliminate a
lot of The Middle manager roles I've
seen Zuck talk about this recently as
meta has been removing a lot of the
middle management I'm curious is there
like a specific company that made you
have this Insight no it wasn't a company
it was I was talking to a friend of mine
who's a private Equity investor he was
talking about taking a company over and
then looking at the efficiencies of it
and he wanted to calculate this ratio of
of the entire company population how
many doers were there how many people
are actually producing work and it was
really small I think it was like 10% of
people inside of a multi thousand person
company were actually delivering work
you look at that cost structure doesn't
make any sense it can make sense so if
you're in a hypergrowth organization and
you think about like a spanic control
which is the number of employees per
manager ideally lots of Studies have
been done ideal numbers about seven but
in a hypergrowth company you can imagine
you're hiring a manager and then that
manager is hiring a team and so they
only have two or three man a control on
average is less but over time what you
really want to get to in particularly as
the company sort of stabilizes or
achieves a certain stable growth
trajectory ideally you're at that seven
where you can drive a lot of efficiency
it's so interesting that you mentioned
it because again like Zuck has been all
over this like since the beginning of
the year and as I was going through and
researching you I saw that you talked
about this last year so maybe Zuck was
uh getting into to Tom's archives I
doubt that way more important things to
do I I I don't know I because I am is
now starting to hear it from other
Founders and I think there's now a
prevailing wisdom that manager only is
not really acceptable in startups and
I'm curious as you think about company
construction and you think about the
ratio of doers to managers and like who
should be doing what like as a VC what's
your take on this and how do you
evaluate it I think this changes as a
function of the capital markets
environment in the last 10 years we had
these environments where Capital was
readily available and so if I can raise
a lot of money than what I'm going to do
as a leader of a company is I will hire
a pretty senior exec team because I have
the capital to be able to have a VP
sales and VP of marketing hire a team of
three to five people out of the gate and
uh my plan is for each of those
departments to probably double or triple
within the course of the next 12 to 18
months to my preference is since capital
is cheap I would rather hire the leader
out of right at the beginning in order
to position the company so that for a
lot of growth and efficiency is less
important now we're in an environment
where efficiency matters you look at
headcount growth plans and there's
they're much smaller than they were 24
months ago which means the productivity
per person and the efficiency per person
is the Northstar metric as opposed to
being able to grow headcount as quickly
as possible to hit a certain growth
number your respective of cost and so I
I agree with you I think a lot more
Founders are one the raising Maybe bit
less money and so may not be able to
afford that VP uh right in the beginning
and they may need to hire a Hands-On
director who's carrying a quota or is
expected to manage uh and actually do
some work in in concert with two or
three other people on the team the
growth at all costs kind of pre macro
was a was a thing right and managers and
leaders had a very long leash almost
like unlimited hire hire what you need
hire what you need and you had a lot of
these layers t- structures individuals
reporting to individuals I mean it just
got almost unruly and a part of that is
ARR per employee and how that fits in to
now looking at Topline and bottom line
together I'm curious if you push your
portfolio companies to look at AR per
employee and what that range looks like
for you because I've seen it all over
the place what should it be in the
Heyday of free money you were looking at
AR per company of like 90 to 120k it's
kind of The Benchmark and I agree with
you I think you'll see companies
particularly to be in later where 300 to
 
I was just talking about this with the
VPS I mean advances with the
llms and a lot of the automation of
customer support work or marketing work
or sales work at what point will we
start to see AI pressure that
productivity even higher to drive
efficiencies I wouldn't be surprised to
see those numbers actually increase
further I'm just really curious about
like how you advise companies on Talent
today versus how you were advising them
five or six years ago are you telling
them I mean obviously higher less I
think is everyone's gotten that message
but when you hire less like you have to
run leaner and so I'm curious if you're
seeing company's index on more senior
Talent uh what the comp is looking like
for those and how you're thinking about
advising from your seat well there are a
couple of big challenges in the space
one is The Hangover from very high
valuation so senior Executives many
senior executives are wondering which
companies to enter Because if a company
has raised a lot of money and has a
large preference stack because they've
taken a lot of investment and the post
money the valuation of the company is
very high relative to current multiples
then that can be a difficult entry point
because the economics or the financial
reward of joining that business is
challenged so for a lot of the strong
Executives who are typically going in
and out of startups that midstage is
actually a financially relatively
unattractive place to go from a current
job into a new job and so you have this
bar Belling where many of the senior
executives are either going to very
early stage companies founding their own
or they're deciding to go later within
the public companies because at least
then there's significant cash
compensation that the equity is liquid
so that's that's been a big change and
the combination of this plus the
efficiency Drive I think is leading to
that that behavior we talked about
before which is people looking for
the Step Up candidates who are player
coach I'm seeing that too it's almost
this paralysis in the the VC Community
right now on both joining and
potentially leaving a company because
the grass definitely isn't Greener at
this at this point in time what are you
seeing as far as exec search and how
long those searches are taking as a
result there's definitely a
lengthening and I think the way that
executive searches were run in the
Heyday you would hire great recruiting
firm and maybe within if you were hiring
like a VP sales you might be able to
find somebody within 60 to 90 days you
were probably paying 75th to 90th
percentile compensation and that was
driving the comp each year higher and
higher people were flexible on Equity
because equity on a relative basis was
inexpensive because the post was very
high and now those searches are they
last longer they last longer because one
candidates are more Discerning one
aspect is this financial reason people
are actually running calculations to
determine at what price do I expect to
generate what return which is I think is
fantastic because candidates should know
exactly what they're getting themselves
into they're investing their most
valuable resource which is time so
that's one Dynamic I think the other
challenge is there are questions around
what the fundraising prospects are for a
business that weren't present two or
three years ago and with the mid-stage
of the market being uneven or choppy or
I mean at the beginning of this year was
just non-functional because the bid ask
spread was so broad that raises a lot of
Doubt so what we see what I see our
Executives wanting to talk to the
existing board understanding how
committed they are to the to sustaining
the business in the case that they can't
raise what that would look like in
different scenarios you had mentioned
the executives either going really early
or going really late what needs to be
true for there to be more even
distribution I think there's two
scenarios one is is that the series A's
of 23 mature into the series B's and C's
of 24 and 25 which will just naturally
happen and the valuations will be more
in line with Market the cap tables will
be straightforward and those companies
will have attrative growth rate so that
will happen the other thing that could
happen is that some of the mid or late
stage companies correct their 4 Nas and
maybe are able to either take flat or
Dow rounds and repic the preferred in
such a way where the economics of an
executive taking on a significant Grant
makes sense again on an individual basis
I think that is much rarer it's much
less likely to happen that second one
will happen more by exception and I
think what we're really waiting for are
those A's of 23 to mature into the BS
and C's of 24 and 25 on the latter
though I'm really interested from your
seat as an investor because some of
these are actually real businesses the
ones that just raised on hype and didn't
have Revenue I think we're starting to
see a lot of those companies die but
there are that actually are just real
businesses that rais that evaluation
that they're not going to be able to
grow into and so a Down Round needs to
happen but as an investor that's got to
be tough for you how do you evaluate
that decision even though it might be
what's best for the business I think you
have to be unemotional about it if you
hold a stock in Google if you hold a
share of Google stock in or maybe
Microsoft will probably know the numbers
a bit better but like a share of
Microsoft was maybe 220 and then it went
up to 360 and then it fell to like 290
 
value of these companies is marked every
second basically every 15 seconds and
that's a function of not only what's
happening inside of the business and how
how well they're running the company but
it's also a function of what's happening
outside of the business and it's easy to
look at private companies and say they
exist within their own ecosystem and
that the pricing doesn't change
and that's been true for 12 years right
we've had an unabated bull market for 12
years now we're finally starting to come
to the realization that we have to pay
the piper for printing 30% more dollars
than I've ever existed venture
capitalist might feel the pinch with
their investors where they have to
report to their LPS that position and
investment has decreased but what I
found within the institutional LP base
is people are just very realistic like
if the public book is down 50% the
private book a collection of Investments
should also be down 50% % and if we can
all be reasonable then it then it should
work out you know there's that loss
aversion Theory where the gain of a
dollar never feels quite as good as
equivalent pain on the loss of a dollar
and which is hard to do but if you can
do it it's the better thing to do long
term hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors

piper I have another question on Talent
over the last 12 years many successful
execs have either transitioned to
advisory Consulting roles or retired
after having a lot of great outcomes in
their careers right and now we're having
to scrape new Talent polls or find new
Executives or convince those retired
ones to come back what are your thoughts
and insights on this and are there
certain roles or functions that are
experiencing the greatest shortages I
think it means it's an incredible time
to be a young and upand cominging
leader because the opportunities you
will be afforded may never happen again
so I think it's very very exciting I
agree with you I've seen it across I
mean LP base you had many cios who said
I've had an amazing run that not going
to happen again in my lifetime so I'll
retire you've had many CEOs like you
said who built effectively little funds
of great portfolio companies of their
time now there's just a lot of like
chewing Gra
where riff after riff and correction and
down rounds and but I think the people
who stick it out and grd it out they're
the ones who will build really
disciplined companies that have the
resolve in the fortitude to be able to
thrive in really tough markets and when
inevitably the market rips again which
it always does they'll be in an
unbelievable position so I think it's a
it's a really wonderful time for young
and up incoming leaders that's such a
unique lens from an investor I was a sea
level exec at 29 you don't know
everything that you're doing right
you're learning as you go along and I
found that the prevailing wisdom from
investors was like actually you should
hire somebody who's been there and done
that and so how do how do you kind of
deal with that tension for like it's the
best time we should be betting on people
versus from your seat it's actually
probably safer to go with the person who
has the experience and who's been there
and done that being the same seat as
Nolan when I was 31 so I'll double down
in that question way at you guys that's
awesome the most important thing I think
in an executive is the flexibility of
mind which means you need to take what
you've learned in the past and apply it
in the situation where it applies and
then learn what you need to learn in
order to to make sure that it works
within the existing organization
somebody who's had let's say a VP of
sales who's had three successes three
unicorns back to back to back there's a
Playbook that crystallizes in their mind
about the right way to build a company
and that Playbook may have worked very
very well in the last 10 years but but
won't work this time right and there are
many and you can find them and you but
you have to look for them they're great
Executives who will take the time to
listen to the organization understand
the nuances about a new business and
come in just in the same way where you
have young and upand cominging leaders
who have an arrogance and think they
know it all um and then you have other
upand cominging leaders who will learn
on the job as you both did very
successfully so I think it's less
about how successful somebody has been
in the past and more what is that
learning mindset in the past 10 years I
would agree with you like the default
for VCS is do hire somebody who has done
it before and that's true in hypergrowth
environment where the cost to a startup
for teaching somebody on the job could
be 10 or 15 percentage points of
ultimate market
share especially at the executive level
but now in most categories let's say AI
side for a second in most categories the
growth rates of these businesses have
come down quite a bit and the cash
balances of these businesses have also
decreased so the relative attractiveness
of actually teaching somebody on the job
has increased I want to talk about
executive terminations and specifically
like you know I think the data right now
is the average executive lasts about 18
months which when you think about it is
is crazy like you take three to six
months to hire them you take another
quarter to onboard them they're there
for nine months they're bringing people
on during that time and then you decide
to terminate them and then usually the
team then turns out and then you start
the cycle all over again I I heard you
say in a podcast that you think one out
of every four exec hirers are going to
get wrong how do you think about getting
it right and then when it when it
doesn't go right how do you think about
then making that change I think there's
two reasons why Executives don't work
out the first is they were the wrong
person for the
role and what I mean by that is they
were either like the diligence process
on that person was not effective enough
or the company didn't realize what it is
that it actually they needed within that
role and it took somebody coming in to
show them that the DNA they thought they
needed is the wrong DNA uh and so that
could be like we really wanted an
Enterprise sales leader but actually
most of our businesses in the midm
market and that transition didn't work
so they ended up hiring a VP uh
Enterprise sales team uh or the market
wasn't there the second reason I think
it doesn't work out is predominantly a
cultural fit there's certain people come
up within and I I'll keep using sales
here but within the Oracle style of
sales versus the Salesforce style of
sales versus a plte and those cultures
are very different the way that they
build teams the way that they manage
quotas you have certain leaders who
manage more through Authority and
respect and other leaders who manage
more through camaraderie and friend ship
and both of those can work but it just
has to be the right fit I think those
are probably equally common in terms of
failure modes at least what I've seen
when it's time to to part ways we we've
decided it's not the right fit talk to
me about like how a Founder communicates
with you what does it look like when it
goes well from your sides like obviously
we're we're in a tough situation but
like what what do you expect from a
Founder in communication and maybe even
the head of people to you as it relates
to Executive performance and then
departures so let's go through the whole
life cycle so typically at an executive
a CEO is leading the search and then at
the very last step I might have a
conversation with that person at the
very first board meeting let's say we're
hire VP of marketing my expectation is
the vpf marketing uh speaks and says
these are my observations on the company
this is what's going well this is not
what's going well the second board
meeting is as a result of everything
that I've learned here's my plan and so
this is like you have two quarters of
ramping up and then a year of execution
before you decide at the second board
meeting I will either look to the CEO or
the CEO likely do this proactively what
do you think about this new person how
is it going and what I'm looking for
there is a balanced scorecard but I'm
particularly paying attention to the
negatives to understand and to see
within during the next board meeting or
during subsequent interactions whether
my perception of those weaknesses are
consistent with the founders um and just
kind of watch and then we track them
over the course of a couple of different
quarters and if two or three quarters
later it's not a fit there's two
different scenarios one is the CEO just
decides uh just wasn't a fit and
communicates that after the fact or the
other is that a CEO might call me and
the other board members and say I'm
thinking about this what do you think
and the reality is by the time somebody
has gotten to the point where they're
seriously thinking about moving someone
out of the organization not a whole lot
you can do best thing to do is to move
really quickly on the tenure piece um
I'm just curious I I've heard this ton
in my my career right you hire someone
in high high growth Venture at the
executive level sea Suite
level with an 18 to 24mth run in your
head uh and then the company changes so
much it grows so fast right the world
goes by it's like a different place by
the time 18 months rolls around even if
they're doing great uh and I'm just
curious how you coach Founders and think
about elongating that tenure and how
executives stay or reup in their role
because it changes so much and if that
that has shifted over the years for you
in that seat this is true for everyone
in the organization including board
members uh so myself included but I
think the the way that I think about um
a person in a role is about slope and in
hypergrowth companies the business has
certain needs and the very best leaders
are the ones who anticipate the needs of
the business and learn those skills
before the business requires of them
inevitably we all hit a limit where
either we can learn fast enough or it
just doesn't play to our strengths and
so it makes sense for somebody else to
lead a function or replace us in a role
as hard as that may be it's probably the
right thing for both sides I think one
of the most important things is just
when somebody comes into a
startup you have to put them in a place
where ideally they're you give them sort
of an at the executive level a little
bit of an amorphous title to buy
yourself that flexibility if this person
does massively outperformed great you'll
go from head of to director or head of
to VP if not we' still love to have you
in the organization you're amazing we
will help you grow we need a
leader managing you in order to help you
grow because the CEO can't spend that
time and so I think that that's a piece
of coaching we give a lot it's possible
sometimes sometimes it's just not
possible you need to give someone a
title that's what they expect the head
of roles usually are they they elicit
either full favoritism or a polarizing
op opposite effect what about interim
roles are you a fan of interim roles
interim is sometimes necessary it's
ambiguous because are they in the seat
for three months six months yes interim
if there's a clear expectation of the
tenure of that person right so you might
you might take a CEO make them interim
CEO and you may communicate to the
company that we're running a CEO search
and the CEO was part of that process and
we expect to hire somebody within six
months I think that makes a lot of sense
but you need that Clarity on what the
tenure is because
otherwise there is a fog around whether
or not employees should build a
relationship and cement this idea that
this person will be in the role for the
long time and what does that mean for
the internal operating Cadence let's
stay on Talent like you you diligence
companies all the time I'm curious how
do you diligence people like do you
diligence executive teams and what is
your process for doing so there's this
awesome Venture quote and I don't know
who's said it but um it said uh startups
would be easy if it weren't for the
people most challenges inside of a
company are having to deal with people
and it's just about getting the right
chemistry to work one of the things that
we spend a lot of time understanding is
one the Dynamics between the founders is
really important how healthy are those
relationships how deep how long and can
they sustain the inevitable ups and
downs and disputes and confrontations
and how do they handle that that's
really important I think the other thing
that we
do are in the the references and my
favorite question in a reference is I'll
ask about a person's strengths and then
instead of asking about weaknesses or
areas of opportunity the way I like to
frame it is what kinds of people does
this person need around them to be
successful which because we all work
together in teams and great teams work
in tension where the strengths of one
balance the weaknesses of another so
we're thinking about what how does the
composition of the team what does it
need to look like in order to be
successful and at different stages
so on the head of people I'm really
curious do you spend time assessing
heads of people and from your lens as an
investor what does a great head of
people look like great question so we
are often investing at the seed and the
a so that's probably two to three years
before there's AE of people the way I
think about it is there used to be this
function that's called HR and HR was
about legal
minimization minimization of legal risk
and during the mid 2000s there was a
change to the head of people which was
that's important and what we really need
our most important or our most valuable
asset within the business is the human
capital as the people inside of the
company and so instead of just
minimizing the risk let's actually
invest and help them grow so if I think
about a a people leader a big part of it
is there's a strategic component to a
people leader is thinking about the the
people within the organization how do we
help them grow how do we segment those
people reward those people particularly
on the exponential curves how do we
build a culture where the next part of
it then is the recruitment part of the
the business which is all about how do
we get that funnel the onboarding
experience the engagement the the
surveys and then the very last part is
the really great strategic people
leaders are the ones
who take a sense of ownership around the
culture of a a place and the a lot of
the times the culture will have been set
by the early employees and the founding
team but they're the ones who to round
out the culture and make sure that it's
a part of every uh employes experience
one of the things that I learned at
Google Eric I didn't think he was as
great of a CEO as I now do um and that's
probably unfair given he was the head of
one of the largest companies ever in the
history of the world but what I realized
in retrospect was he had a way of
leading that was enabled by the people
function that allowed him to have a
voice in every conversation so every
time we were meeting as a product and
engineering team we had a question we
would think back to either the values of
the company or the principles that Eric
would dis spouse that were constantly
being disseminated through the company
and so in that way he was in every room
and I think amazing people leaders are
the ones who were able to to do that
effectively and as you're maybe in your
your later stage companies Tom in
boardrooms right what are the things
that you see hear feel real time in that
room that you know that group has the
right people leader the relationship
with the CEO is Extreme ly tight there's
this function that Google and other
companies called The Human Resources
business partner
and when a human resources business
partner ahead of people is a key
strategic Ally to the CEO you can see
there's there's an intimacy there
because the CEO is going to the head of
people and saying I have this difficult
conversation or there's this
misalignment here and they're effect
they're they're an internal consultant
about interpersonal issues and then
organizational design that's one of the
aspects I think that that's like the
gold standard if you can see that
relationship and that level of trust
almost a management coach in a sense to
the CEO and if you're a solo CEO then
maybe you want to hire this function
sooner rather than later I think the
second is a pulse on of the company
really seeing that this person
understands we went through riff last
quarter this is how people are feeling
proactive surveys understanding events
trying to really understand what's going
out inside of the business and that's
like softer and a little harder to
describe but you can see some people
leaders are a little bit more
disconnected some people leaders are
people of the people I you can kind of
call them that's another one and then
the last and this is probably a personal
preference people who are very data
oriented like you look at the recruiting
funnel you can take a look at the
recruiting funnel and determine as a
function like how many people are
recruiting out of PHD programs how many
people are recruiting out of Master's
programs what are the success rates I
think those would be the three update I
want to transition to talk a little bit
about looker you and and Kelly work
together on looker looker is a a
fantastic company with a fantastic
outcome I think what's interesting when
I look at looker and I think about
today's moment is lots of people have
been talking about more m&amp;a on the
future except like most people don't
have an insight into how m&amp;a actually
works let's just start at the highest
level of like how did that process
actually work um and and like how did we
get to like okay looker is going to be
sold to Google successful companies will
have many m&amp;a offers along the way and
or maybe not offers but indications of
interest that an acquisition could
happen and at some point what it what
happens is that the the management team
decides that for a wide variety of
different reasons at this point in time
it's prudent to consider it there's
there's also a fiduciary a legal
requirement that is if an acquir does
show significant signs of Interest the
CEO must take it to the board so there's
that Dynamic too but uh setting that
aside at some point a management team
will say it's worth
considering the further you go in an m&amp;a
process and before the term sheet the
more likely it is that the acquisition
closes so at the very beginning it's
easy to walk away because people have a
sense of Pride and the company is doing
really well the more people start to
think about how much money they'll make
or what their life will be like in terms
of the acquire the more the acquisition
process takes on a life of its own and
so that's you know I went through the
looker acquisition and the customer
acquisition and a few others and so
there's a sort of like this point of
like no return where people are
committed to the acquisition and
barring like either violent disagreement
with the board or completely
dissatisfactory terms it'll will like
happen
so one firm one acquir comes into the
conversation management team decides and
the board decides this is a good time to
explore this then you'll spin up an
auction right you'll either hire an
investment banker or you'll talk to
other people who have expressed interest
in the past and you create a data room
you bring you create a small team of
people who are in the know nearly the
smallest possible and the board and at
that point the board probably starts
meeting every week or every 10 days
where there are scheduled calls just to
get an update on what's happening in the
process and the
negotiations then you get to a point
where the term sheet is signed and the
point between when the term sheet is
signed or letter of intent is signed and
the close is an extremely weak part the
company is the most vulnerable there U
because it has committed itself and
indicated to the broader Market in the
employees that it has been sold but it
must continue to operate independently
we went through this with look you were
there for I think it was 12 months where
we had to operate in this sort of limbo
between Market thought we were acquired
but we couldn't act as if we were
Acquired and you know are we hiring
people with Google Shares are we hiring
people with looker shares how does that
all work there's just a lot of
complexity I think we called it
limboland
yeah you're expected to run your
business as you see fit but not really
it's a real challenge uh and so there's
a lot of complexity there and you you
did a job I mean cannot oh was the great
wonderful team wonderful exec team and
no one to your question just being
honest about it is half the battle right
this is hard here's what's going on
versus just silence and everyone kind of
waiting there but it was it felt like
three years I can't even imagine what it
would be like to be an employee in that
situation well the hard part with
Venture on this too and you know Tom I'm
wrong the people that go into these
companies they're not trying to hang out
all day not do stuff
like they're there to push they're there
to build they're energetic they're
competitive they're Mission oriented
they want to add value and so being in
limbo land with that type of disposition
is very difficult very difficult Kelly
how did you navigate the calms of that
so like walk us through the okay you get
looped in I'm assuming at at some point
like into this data room piece that Tom
was referring to right the the LOI gets
signed right and like walk us through
like how how did you communicate to the
company and like how did you navigate 12
months of purgatory it's the leadership
of of the group really I mean Frank was
amazing right he is as real as they come
as human as they come and just talking
through this the other interesting thing
is these these Acquisitions usually come
as disruptive to a course you're on
right we had S1 work streams kicked off
I mean we were on our way and they some
of the most successful best Acquisitions
kind of take a hard right turn so it was
it was the change around that plus that
confidentiality and for me the most
difficult part wasn't the communication
I think you know there was a lot of
apprehension because looker is so unique
and potent as a culture uh and who they
were and so that that apprehension of
going into Google was one thing how do I
navigate this new environment but for me
you know Tom was talking about these
unique aspects of the deal it was the
offers right and it was the
organizational slotting right taking
these very creative people who were so
non-h hierarchical and trying to fit
them into a
 
that's splitting hairs and really
important by the way once you're in a
structure at Google it's it's like Fort
Knox to get out of it or change it so
that was probably the most nuanced part
of the employee side was making sure
that we were setting Lookers up for
success in that new structure in ways
that they didn't even know was necessary
until a year into the company when the
perf cycle happened right and then on
top of that one of the criteria for the
deal going through Tom was that 85% or
more of Lookers had to sign that offer
letter for the deal to go through uh and
there was International complexities
there was this there was that so it was
quite the the team effort first of all
but doing the right thing for your
employees and not rushing that was nice
that was the benefit of the Purgatory we
had time to make sure that was I think
we had 100% of offers signed actually if
I recall that's insane three-dimensional
chess Tom what about when it's not
looker and it's not a multi-billion
dollar acquisition and it's more of like
a this thing isn't G to work out walk us
through how those work so my M model is
there's three kinds of Acquisitions
there are team Acquisitions there's team
technology Acquisitions and then team
technology and Revenue
and roughly like the team Acquisitions
are 0 to 50 maybe 0 to 25 today the team
in technology let's call it 25 to 150
and then the team technology and revenue
and these are just rough numbers 150
plus when it doesn't work out uh
typically what ends up happening is a
company runs up against its financials
and the board says and or the founder
decides it's time to sell the business
and they're unlike in the very large
Acquisitions you likely don't have a
banker to help you and you're looking at
a bunch of different structures you
might be looking at an aqua hire so just
buying the team and then the company and
its assets and liabilities dissolve or
they're sold to somebody else or uh the
other is you buy the team and just like
intellectual property but the
liabilities remain with the company and
then the last is you buy the whole thing
and typically those are done looker we
did a few of these very small
Acquisitions uh they're called tucking
Acquisitions mainly for people and th
those people typically get U maybe a
signing bonus bit higher of an equity
package relative to a new person coming
in I mean most of these Acquisitions are
executed by relationships when a company
is bought whether it's a big one or a
small one there is somebody inside of
the business who is basically staking
their career on this acquisition we
should buy this business for this
particular reason the very large
companies the very large Acquisitions
there are BD teams that are building
business case and a GM is signing up for
a three to a fiveyear financial plan
that correlates to Ultimate market cap
increase and revenue increases at the
really small level it's probably a CEO
of another private company who says we
really need this technology for this
particular road map and here's the cost
savings that we get by buying this team
as opposed to trying to hire a team and
build a product ourselves Tom just
shifting to to the rest of this year
going into next year where's the puck
going in VC I mean obviously like AI is
super hot it seems like seed in series a
is is still ripping although you know
maybe at lower valuations the grow
stages though is where I think a lot of
people have a lot of questions and I'm
curious to just get your general
sentiment on where Venture back tech
companies are going uh end of this year
into next year so I think this is a
question that's probably the most the
most determinant for the health of the
ecosystem one of the big questions is
what will the FED do with rates that's a
big one Diamond just said yesterday
Jamie Diamond is the CEO of JP Morgan
that he expects rates to go to 7% which
nobody was expecting currently five and
a half if that happens then I think the
growth Market continues to be
dysfunctional into next year setting
that aside let's just say rates stay
where they are at five and a half
percent or somewhere close what we're
starting to see is the bid ask spread so
what companies are asking versus what
VCS are willing to pay that's coming
closer and closer to give you a sense uh
the secondary Market spread was about
 
the buy side and the sell side was
asking for and now that's kind of close
to like 20 maybe 15% so we're starting
to see it come back it's still not there
there um but as more companies need to
raise Capital it's coming closer and
closer so current course and speed I
think you'll see the market being
functional late this year into early
next year the IPO Market the clayo IPO
in particular in the software world has
traded very nicely I think you'll see a
lot of s1's happen in the back half of
this year particularly as some of fangs
are hampered by the ftc's investigations
for antitrust and so more companies will
choose to go public than I think sell
themselves for that reason and there
seems to be a lot of Institutional
Investor demand for some of these new
IPOs so I think the more successful
those are the more vibrant the mid-stage
part of the Venture Market will be too
and and then just on AI you're a leading
voice in VC on AI what are you most
excited about I was wondering about the
relative productivity and GDP gains of
the personal computer versus Ai and all
the studies I could find suggest that AI
will have something
like at least a thousand times more
impact to productivity than the personal
computer did and even if that's that's
wrong by a factor of like 20 or
 
in productivity which is awesome um it's
really important for the us as a country
it's really important for our economy
and I think there need to be a
significant amount of like retraining
and we all have to learn how to use our
computers again in almost every White
Collar function and I'm really excited
about that like I I think it's easy to
have a very negative view of it in the
early 1900s there were four million
people washing dishes and then the home
dishwasher was made and invented and and
the U commercial dishwasher was made and
all those people were repurposed in into
other functions working at a higher
level of abstraction more interesting
work I think that's what will happen
with AI and uh I'm I'm really excited
about that I think um it'll allow us to
get a lot more leverage from these
amazing computers that we've been able
to build last question for you is if you
were an executive and you were thinking
about joining one of these AI companies
right now it's it's actually hard to
tell what's real and what's not like
we're still in the first inning how
would you evaluate that decision I think
the first thing I'd really care about
would be the strength of the team and I
think the second thing that I'd really
care about would be so it depends it
like the infrastructure in the
application layer but let's say I'm
looking to work at a software company at
the application layer I would really
want to go after a market where there
was no significant incumbent there was
no Salesforce or zendesk or if there
were they were completely Reinventing
the software and what I mean by this is
when the App Store came out the first
wave of mobile applications were little
chicklet boxes around web pages and then
for square came and that was a mobile
native app and then Uber came out that
was a mobile native app I don't think
we've really yet seen the first AI
native application where from the
architecture from infrastructure from
the product design decisions it was
built for AI right and I would be
looking for an application that looks
like that where you've never seen it
before looks completely different and if
it works like you can you can make a big
debt so Tom as we gear towards closing
any tactical advice you'd offer for
audience of either HR folks or Founders
or both as we enter this new year I
think if things continue to go as they
are the very best companies will be the
ones who whose reaction time to changing
economic conditions in the positive
sense are faster so there will be a
point in time and I can't tell you when
but there will be a point in time when
the market does return and the companies
who are much more aggressive on hiring
and building out the sales and marketing
functions particularly when they start
to see like outperformance or increas in
efficiencies the ones who are courageous
in doing that I think can capture
another 10 or 15 or 20 points of market
share and all of a sudden be worth like
 
at the companies that I work with in the
advice that I'm giving some of them
particularly the ones who are in strong
positions I'm trying to pay as close
attention possible as some of those
leading signals of the market returning
and the buyer Behavior coming back
predictability in sales Cycles sales
Cycles decreasing our performance
because if you can be aggressive there
you can really improve the value of the
company get back on the offense it's
very counterintuitive to the fear
mongering I think that's like out there
right now and quite refreshing to hear
from my standpoint so Tom I really
appreciate the time this was insanely
valuable to me and I know our listeners
are going to love it I was such a
privilege to be with you both thanks for
the
invitation there's conflict in the
Middle East Kelly and a lot of Founders
and chro are asking asking themselves
how do we talk about this situation and
so I'll give you just a little insight
into the way that we think about it at
Continuum I I don't know if this is
right but I'm just going to to tell you
what we do and I would love to get your
take on things we follow the Brian
Armstrong we don't talk about politics
at work in general we are trying to
build a business and ultimately we want
to be so successful that our employees
get wealthy from this experience and
that they can can allocate their wealth
to solve problems that we cannot solve
as a business so Kelly I'm I'm actually
curious about your take and how you guys
think about this and how you
specifically think about solving this
problem I will speak to this more
generally in my experience as a cheat
people officer and it's actually not to
not talk about things at work I tend to
take the the middle ground on a lot of
things and try and be in as inclusive as
possible but with clear boundaries if
that makes sense so for us a lot of the
the pieces around this was talk about it
with groups of people that feel
comfortable talking about it versus
companywide channels Etc that are really
there for doing business so clubs
specific Affinity groups lunchtime
meetings communities of Silence other
chat groups right we we never shut that
down we actually encourage that I do
like the boundary element though as far
as it seeping in to the day-to-day and
for me it's never never been easy right
because in our roles we might have
different viewpoints and as example I
had a situation once right I'm lgbtq I
have a wife Etc and we have an lgbtq
affinity group most do and I had someone
say look I want an affinity group for
Christian conservative values that are
yes against the LGBT you know and we had
to deal with that and it was like
hm like right that inclusivity I think
is a
very very common denominator that we
have to solve for is even if it's like
 
they have a voice but where you put that
voice and how you have that voice
interact with companywide values and
where we do business I think that's the
work so did you draw the line or did you
create a new group we did not allow for
for a again a company sponsored affinity
group cuz again I'm like damn what's
what's the backbone like how do I
simplify and that affinity group would
fly in the face of one of our biggest
values which is respect for all that
example is exactly the reason why I
don't want to talk about it at work
because creating that line is it's
arbitrary it is arbitrary and it does
take a lot of time so you're saying that
you didn't even have it anywhere yeah we
put it in our culture docs explicitly
stating we do not talk about politics at
work our take is is that many of these
topics are
controversial and just getting even into
that context and Nuance takes up a ton
of time and is a
distraction and so I I know it's not
like the warm and fuzzy culture I do
believe companies should indicate to
candidates during the inter
process how they view politics at work
and let candidates either opt in or opt
out because once somebody is there and
if then if you change policies on them
it's a little bit unfair because they
accepted a job you know with a with a
premise or a guise of how they expected
you to respond and then you move the
ball around on them and that's where I
do think coinbase did it right is they
said look we are changing our policy and
we are ALS allowing you to opt out and
we will give you Severance to opt out
and I think that's done really well and
I think a lot of companies are now
following in their footsteps I
personally think that we should allow
some of this conversation at work I
think it's going to happen anyway Nolan
whether you have your handbook or not we
talked about this in our Patty episode
like sometimes things are slippery
slopes and all of a sudden everything is
in that consideration set so I do
applaud folks like you that are like no
keep it out but I think that it's it's
going to seep in anyway I guess is my
there's not a perfect answer I think is
is the short answer here and
unfortunately Founders and cheap people
officers do have to figure out their
stance and how they navigate these
issues and so all I can recommend is to
think about it
beforehand because when you're in it
tensions rise and it's really easy uh to
get pulled along in a narrative
um or onto one side as to where you
should be and if you think about it
beforehand and how you're going to
respond to these sorts of things
hopefully it provides a little bit more
clarity when you actually are in the fog
of War like I remember when George Floyd
happened and whatnot I mean we had
leaders running around grabbing HR
leaders like toddlers on their pant leg
being like what do I do what do I do
what do I do and that wasn't that long
ago this is I think this is this is
fairly new it it absolutely Ely is I'm
not saying it should be like that well
and that's but that's kind of my point
is like there is a new expectation from
employees that a company comments every
SI for every situation that happens I
don't think that's a fair expectation I
think your stance on it is we will
comment but we will say we don't know
this is really hard and that's that's
fair I think another take that more
companies are starting to lean into is
we're just not going to comment and talk
about it it's not perfect because you
don't want to people to be robots um and
I don't expect that but I I do think now
in this new world with higher interest
rates valuations lower harder to
fundraise companies have to focus on
building real businesses I don't think
we will have a choice it's like another
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing to solve but if you solve
it when there isn't a crisis I think
it's a lot better for everybody I agree
I but like I said think it will be part
of the table Stakes like intake form of
what companies need to think about going
forward totally but let's also empathize
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is not easy like a lot of
times companies Founders even Chief
people officers avoid leaning into this
until they have to because it's scary
and there is fear of what the responses
are and what the reactions are and if I
can avoid it and not deal with any
reaction that might be less
distracting but I think we are getting
to a point now where that's going to be
more and more impossible I think it is
impossible I think we're already there
the more you try and Tuck this thing
under the rug the bigger the problem
becomes and the harder it is to solve
for me this is the future of work
conversation that is the real
conversation around the future of work

having HR Heretics is a podcast from
