what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today we
have Andy price on the show Andy you're
a VC and you're also one of the best
exec Recruiters in the world you've
worked with huge winners along the way
including snowflake confluence mu soft
and amplitude just to name a few of
those we're stoked for this conversation
welcome to the show man thank you so
much so so honored to be here thank you
all right so I'm a I'm a fanboy and I'm
really excited to get into the
nitty-gritty of executive recruiting
especially from you so I want to start
with uh some of my learnings at door Das
I worked really closely with Tony and he
always said the Michael Jordan of exec
recruiting gets it right two out of
three times why is the hit rate for
execs so low um for him it might be
two-thirds because he's one of the best
Founders in ever I think that guy is a
superstar and a great human and is
really committed to building an A+ team
and he's thoughtful very thoughtful
about hiring as you know so I would say
two-thirds in the world of Tony is one
thing the reality is like most often I
mean I had a partner with one of the
best Venture firms in history one of the
top two probably guess which one it is
say to me we get hiring right onethird
of the
time so I think that the reason for that
is very simple it's like if you look at
humans and then you look at companies
you have complex organisms right every
human is a complex collection of
molecules of strung together right and
the same thing is true of companies
although what you do is you look at
companies there are far more complex
than any individual human being so if
you thought about this as a parallel to
like genomics for example right and
you're going okay can we understand
genomics and then figure out like how to
build drugs that fit this person's
specific genic profile thereby
increasing efficacy then you say okay
that's a huge win in healthcare so by a
parallel to making hiring go to more
like three out of three as opposed to
one out of three although Tony's again
being generous at two3 you know you
really would have a tough time the
reality is is that there's so many
variables that throw off because you
could have a great candidate right and a
great company and yet those two just
don't make it because of variables you
cannot possibly see in my mind the
mitigation factors are really
understanding who you are as an
organization what you need in the
standard BS like oh this culture and
this person has to be a culture fit
usually your culture is wrong or it's
immature or it's like incomplete or it's
a collection of subcultures and it needs
to evolve here and the EXA supposed to
take you there but the resistance to
that you know impact that these people
are here to make right there there's no
exec that's hired that's not there to
improve something right or change
something so by definition everyone's
into change management without even
really even being able to articulate
that so I feel like mitigating these uh
blowups is all
about being really pragmatic as opposed
to quote unquote aspirational about
whether or not the person coming in your
company or the company you're joining if
you're the candidate you know are going
to be this perfect harmonious situation
you have to strap in for some vibrations
and wildness and chaos and ambiguity in
order to be pragmatic about okay no
there not perfect and neither are we
let's try to figure out how we mesh
together and give this person a chance
to succeed does that make sense and the
fact that the industry is so immature
still around organization development HR
processes on boarding stuff like that
those are all factors in why you have
what I call tissue rejection so I want
to know what you do to try and mitigate
that so walk us through you you close a
client now we're about to kick off a
search together what is your process to
try and mitigate that outcome yeah so
just quick detail I I run our fund I do
not even run our search firm what I do
is I help with every search that's
meaningful effective you know mostly the
ones that our fund is involved with but
you know if you're a high-profile
company and you're backed by one of our
strategic Partners I will give you more
of my time than normal yeah so so say
artisanal kicks off a search what is the
artisanal process to mitigate a bad
executive outcome good question I think
the best way to mitigate a bad out is
you actually have to Silk with a company
so when we designed our search firm it
was always with the view that if you had
more time to dedicate to an existing
company then you would actually
understand what's really going on what
happens in most exec searches founder
will get on a call because the VC said
call recruiter X Y or Z and there's some
really great ones out there the great
ones that I know that are competitors to
our search firm
artisanal have this exact same thing in
common with artisanal which is like okay
let's just let's do not just one fly by
meeting okay I need this okay great
we'll go find that person for us send us
a contract we'll go find some people for
you that's like a simplistic way of
going and it's a reckless approach the
better thing to do is go okay what are
you doing tell me everything's wrong
with you tell me all your warts all your
problems all the things that are not
working don't tell me how awesome your
company is tell me where it's going to
go wrong so more we understand that the
more a we can say okay the candidate's
smart if they're good they're smart
they're going to figure this out on
their own let's mitigate the concerns
ahead of time so we can actually close
them once they've been closed how they
are successful is they understand the
work ahead of them that means pulling
out of the company what is up with your
company what are your hopes yes and
where are your points of failure so if
you really holistically understand the
company and then you go out for the
candidate so that's the company side you
have to soak with these companies and
understand what is really going on there
and the founders have to be super
transparent and build some trust with
the recruiters and say look I'm not
perfect because any good recruiter will
be like we know there's something wrong
you're not telling us that's where the
magic is and then on the candidate side
and I'll tell you what I always tell
Founders like interviewing most often
you're likely to screw it up add the
wrong people they've got an agenda they
don't want to get to they finance person
doesn't like salespeople some issue is
going to happen inside your process
that's probably going to be
problematic process is overrated hiring
process this is the one magic thing you
have to nail every single time how do
you back channel the hell out of
somebody with people you trust in a
contextually Accurate Way meaning
don't just back Channel and talk to the
person that worked for them 85 years ago
like that maybe knew them when they were
 
you go after the people that you know
you might have some connectivity to you
get the real book on this person what is
wrong more you know about what's wrong
with people the more you'll be able to
understand what your tolerances are for
the realities of their human self right
and that's the important piece is how
safely because you can't just go back
Channel people a lot of these people are
gainfully employeed the best ones
usually are you can't just bat Channel
these people you know with without
taking some risk and it's bad form but
you have to do that work so the
referencing is where the rubber meets
the road where the client understands
okay I'm going to get some questionable
backrounds on these people are they're
character related they got fired for
cause they drink too much use drugs
whatever they do they you know are
inappropriate with people of opposite
gender whatever any of those character
things you got to walk or run away from
that person but at the end of the day if
you go okay this person doesn't
understand demand gen as deeply as they
should but they're amazing of product
marketing and general management of a
marketing function can we live with this
inadequacy of this skill Gap is an easy
one the referencing piece is the number
one factor Andy back channels was on my
list for you because we've talked about
it a few times on this show over the
past year or so and I had to hear it
from you kind of what your fundamental
beliefs and philosophies are around back
channeling the dos and don'ts how do you
engage in that process versus the
company because I've you know hired cxos
for a while now and it can be a a Nutty
Feeding Frenzy everyone's freaking
throwing snowballs and doing back
channels and all of a sudden it's a big
mess like how does that work for you
what do you what do you do around that
specifically well I mean anybody who's
experienced enough I me this is the
interesting thing it's like if you ask
me if I was not involved in recruiting I
didn't have a recruiting company I would
say objectively this there are 28- year
olds in the industry that are more
interesting and more and smarter and
harder working than anybody at my level
and all over the place all over the
industry and they should be used to hire
the kind of the upand cominging lower
risk lower visibility people but when
you go after a CA level hire for a
company that aspires to be a 10 or 20
billion dollar you know $50 billion
dollar market value public company you
are trying to drisk that asset I know
people don't go oh hirings about
drisking but that's just naive you hire
people to drisk the long-term viability
of of your asset period I'm sorry but
that's how I that's what I believe after
 
means that you need to have recruiters
that actually understand who the target
is so a lot of times the VCS or whoever
will will refer recruiters and sometimes
even we get calls we're completely
unqualified for when we go sorry guys
call this person there was a
semiconductor call the other day and it
said hey call this guy at Spencer stur
is the semic you should only use
recruiters that have native familiarity
with the candidate you're hunting me
they should be specialized they should
be go to market person or engineering
product person or finance and HR
recruiter CEO recruiter whatever they
are they should be specialist and
natively understand the people you're
chasing and then in terms of
orchestrating that back Channel this
person that is senior enough to say to
have the trusted relationship with a
person that was at Koopa or snowflake or
whoever these outsize outcomes were you
always try want to try to aim at people
that were with some meaningful company
you know you're you're you're you're
looking for operators with some serious
experience behind them you should be
able to get to hold of that person and
and this is what you do you just call
them and you say hey I'm doing this do
you have any ideas first of all see if
they offer up your candidate that's easy
and then if they don't offer up your
candidate you go hey you know I'm just
kind of curious about this person you
don't tell them I'm looking for a you
know president of a billion dollar
privately held company you don't named X
you just go hey I've just heard some
things about this person I'd love to get
your take you're very vague about why if
you have a good relationship with that
person they'll offer it up if you don't
have a good relationship with that
person you shouldn't have called them
but being sloppy with back channels or
just not doing them is is worse than
taking a little bit of a calculator risk
and just asking about the person but I
don't recommend adding the additional
context about what specific company it
is and what specific role you're just
checking to say what's your opinion of
someone does that make sense and then
from there you're digging into specific
questions but you just don't want to
reveal who the client is because you
have to assume these people are like in
a high school locker room and they can't
wait to tell somebody that they got a
call about so and so and about this
topic I mean people chatter it's really
kind of ridiculous and immature but
that's systemic in Tech wow so that's
really interesting what I'm hearing you
say is the recruiter is actually doing
the back channel are there times when
you think the CEO should be doing the
back Channel yes but tightly
orchestrated and this is the key thing I
mean very few Founders are really well
connected to the executive Network right
so like what's the likelihood that they
were a c-l person at some A+ company
it's usually like these younger people
that come out pop out of an interesting
company and they're
 
company or whatever they won't have that
connective tissue to safely back Channel
somebody who's gainfully employed so
what happens the recruiter does it first
it says listen I'm not going to tell you
what this person said I just teed it up
now we're in safe mode this
conversation's already happened hey
there might be a Founder you think
you're willing to spend some time with
this founder extremely confidentially if
that person trusts you and you trust
them clear if there's a lack of trust
I'd be careful I would just get the
candidate to app Point that's the last
thing I'll say unless you guys have more
detailed question that wait until the
person's somewhat in the tractor beam
right they're getting pulled towards the
Death Star and I can't resist the
metaphor sorry that person's in the
tractor beam you know they're committed
to the company that's when you're more
in the safe Zone you have to say to the
person Hey listen I'm G to check you out
you good with that like if people are
worried about being checked out it's a
pretty big flag the best people be call
anybody you want I'm fine I'm committed
I'm really excited about this company
you still want to have some decorum
still want to have some hygiene is what
I would call it back channeling hygiene
we're not just flying around but you
absolutely are correct to bring up the
fact that the founders should do the V
Channel they might just have to do the
same one you're doing at a certain phase
in the process in the tractor beam does
that make sense is there a magic number
Andy where you're like that is way too
freaking many stop or does it depend
people always go I gotta do 20 that's
just hyperbolic BS nobody does 20 you
don't need 20 you need really like five
to seven ones that count even three
really count I knew this person I worked
with them for years hired them several
times fired them you know there there's
some like deep familiarity you can get
deep color it's really about how much
color you get as opposed to volume of
people it's depth of conversation depth
of context as opposed to breadth of
people that number yeah I have one more
on this in doing this in my experience
as well Andy the thing that I've seen
you guys said 2/3 and one3 I usually say
it works out 50% of the time just cuz my
brain brain this works simply and and
usually the reason for it not working
out in my experience isn't the person's
technical or functional skill set or or
whatever it's the it's the personality
fit it's the vision fit it's the
Dynamics once you get in there and you
really are living with someone and you
figure out you can't live with this
person and then I've gotten right well
let's get rid of them 60 days called the
search firm they didn't do a good job
they're they're not fit like how have
you handled that because that's
something that's that's whereing gets
really messy I mean look recruiters are
the most overpaid people in the world
like there were back in the 90s it was
like mortgage brokers and recruiters
over the same and now it's like recruit
let's be honest so the reality is is
that the recruiters have to get plant
the right person and then be in constant
contact with them you should be talking
to your candidates that you hired once a
month once a quarter and you're going to
detect what's going on and the early
vibrations if you're doing the real work
actually happens after the hire I hire
is not that complicated people over
complicated all the time your real work
is making sure that organism that you
just planted in this other organism
doesn't have tissue rejection organ
rejection whatever you remember and so I
think what you have to do is detect
early issues did we over hire what's
happening here hey Canada we call our
candidates all the time say listen you
should probably we we recommend you
worry about sales Ops for example our
cro hey we're hearing a little bit of
chatter about gaps and some of the gaps
have to do with just you know data and
Analysis and coverage and the financial
side of this uh we highly recommend you
hire an Ops person imate that you have
to have trust with your with your
candidate that they don't freak out
because you got you gave them some free
advice it's really just a heads up so
you can mitigate a lot of blowout Risk
by doing that and then also just being a
person that the founder or the VCS or
both trust enough that you say look it's
the founders problem or it's a market
product you we have these early stage
companies all the time they have no
marketing no product Market fit you know
there's not a there there and so these
sales execs are flopping around trying
to find some traction some reputability
and in those early days it's such a
risky chaotic thing that you really have
to make sure that everybody's heads are
screwed on properly even before you
start a search a lot of times we look at
these searches we like you don't even
need to do a search you should
definitely not pay any money to hire
anybody yet you are too early Founders
really need to lead sales for example in
C to a should never hire VP sales before
an A and before some meaningful product
Market better attraction doesn't have be
p for sa track repeatable traction and
so people when they either overhire or
hire too early that's where we see a lot
of volatility and mitigating those
things is either not doing a search in
first place and convincing the Cent the
founder to wait until they're ready or
having sanity checks early and often
about what is appropriate at this
particular stage of a company you know
there's not a lot of Chris Deans out
there that can go from zero Revenue
making cold calls I think he made a
thousand a week or something like that
in the beginning of snowflake all the
way to3 billion doll public company
they're about
maybe five of those in history that's
not normal that's not normal hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after a word from our sponsors Real Talk
most Talent leaders haven't yet cracked
how to leverage AI for Meaningful impact
on their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting team's efficiency and quality
use metav view metav view is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conf ation like intakes interviews and
debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
candidates during calls and save time on
the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline hiring teams
can make confident informed decisions
and talent leaders can finally take
control of the interview process join
forward thinking Talent leaders at high
performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and Kora and check out
medavie head over to metav vi. a/
Heretics to talk to one of metav VI's
product experts or get started for free
you'll be UPR running an AI enabled in
minutes love the fact that the work
starts after the hire is made I can't
tell you like how many execs don't have
an onboarding plan it's just kind of
like R and you know I've always been
very close to the exec recruiter and the
hire right that that she people officer
of that company it's almost like a Triad
a trusting Triad between the exec
recruiter the CPO and the new officer on
like we are here to hug you make it
successful good bad or ugly and that
doesn't happen a lot be surprised it
doesn't happen at I I don't think I've
ever seen it and I love the I love the
idea of the exec recruiter post hire
giving a symmetry to the new hire like
hey like you need to cover this blind
spot because that's like everyone's
incentives are Al line right because if
that person turns out then you're doing
the search again they don't want to get
fired the company doesn't want it to to
 up I I love like that as a practice
and I don't think I've ever actually
seen anyone do that which brings me to
how should companies vet search firms
this is a tough one man um do you know
the candidate I'm trying to hunt period
how natively do you know this world when
you know this is why I I left my last
company it was crazy solid company it
just wasn't completely focused on
specializing and I learned from a
competitor that specializing was the
only way forward this is eight or so
years ago and I felt like if you're
going to survive and actually Thrive you
have to be deeply specialized and and so
I looked at other companies that were
really doing well and really kind of own
that so you know we will not have any
generalists in our search firm and so I
think that you know looking at a wide
sample look saying okay have they done
relevant searches in our space fairly
recently and then when the search firm
comes to the table they should be coming
in their first meeting with ideas for
the founder to consider period like I
did my homework on the thing I looked at
your website I looked at your
competitors here's my observations and
here are some ideas it might be terrible
but it's early AV testing and the
founders should be sitting there being
like does this person kind of come
prepared like that's a good sign you
know and there are people like I said
these 28 year olds that'll come there's
one guy at a competitor of ours he's a
 
amazing and really impressed me I mean I
just got to know him and I have a lot of
competitors I really deeply respect and
learn from even if they're younger and
this guy has the he has it down on uh
prepping and coming to meetings you know
ready to think about okay what could
make sense for this kind of company like
I said even if they're wrong as shows
they care about prep work they studied
your company they thought about they
didn't mail it in so people should look
out for sloppiness they should look out
for search firms that have no A+
clientele what happens is uh a lot of
times people go oh just call so and so
because you can get a search done more
cheaply there are search Firs out there
they'll give away the service and you go
okay well let's look at their clientele
it's a bunch of a f minus companies so
if you're a candidate and you're well
placed which is where all like I said
the best people are 90% currently
employed and that's the bane of the
recruiters existence you're carving
people out of situations they don't need
to take your call you got to give them a
good reason a good reason is having an
A+ clientele and really saying this is
what we stand for we don't take
companies turnaround shrinking this that
and there are a handful of recruiters
out there that figured this out a while
ago and they're snotty as hell and I
think what you need to do if you're a
quality company aspiring to hire quality
people is have a native familiar to the
animal this company needs to H whether
whatever stage whatever category it is
and then B some cache some kind of
marketing punch so the candidates look
at that and they go you know I got 10
calls this day I'm taking these two
these two firms called me and I looked
at their website I looked at their the
way they approached me this is a group
that's highly professional what happens
like I said is there's this fee um
erosion in the industry certain firms
are sold out I won't name them certain
firms are sucking wind and getting cut
in half in a year this has been a tough
economy for 90% of the industry so the
willing to take deals and then do 30 of
them at a time for under 100K per and
some of these Founders go oh yeah I can
get a search for 60k from a c minus
search firm and then a year later they
wonder why they got a C minus candidate
okay well you get what you pay for and
I'm not saying to promote artial there
is another firm that's more highly
priced than artisol that I won't name
just because I actually I don't know if
the founder who's a friend of mine would
want to be named but that's like they go
really highend and they do very small
amounts of projects and they're
extremely bespoke they have a great
clientele we really love and respect
those guys even though they're are
trials and we think that's the correct
way to do things be selective with their
clientele so a lot of the founders just
aren't equipped to ask the search firms
these questions because the VCS are kind
of like yeah yeah talk to these five
firms and the founder goes okay whoever
sends me the lowest price contract is
the service R that's a really naive way
to think about it yeah I've worked with
a lot of search firms Andy over the past
 
to like break this myth I have in my
head and I'm just going to be vulnerable
here like the name droppers I can't
handle like is that a thing because I've
never actually asked the person but I've
gotten on these calls they're like yeah
yeah I've been around I know this person
they're a friend we'll give them a call
yeah I know this person I mean it's like
the name dropper and it was just like am
I at a used car lot like what's going on
here and I've had Founders be like they
know everyone this is great I'm like no
this is not great this is weird and it
feels off and you know I you're you're
one of them and I'd love to know if
that's a thing or not or if I'm making
this up in my head because I personally
annoyed this is happening no I mean look
people should infer based on who your
clientele is that you know interesting
people and other people should do your
selling for you if have earned the right
as a recruiter to be in interesting
companies having interesting clientele
it's because you work for other
interesting clientele and the companies
did really well and your hirers did
really well now you've earned the right
to work for A+ companies if you have not
the your portfolio of clients your logo
page whatever you want to call it
tombstones it's going to be in pretty
obvious who knows who and you shouldn't
have to even tell anybody you should
spect they should be going to you going
oh my God you were with these companies
and even then the best recruiters are
usually going to say yes thank you I did
I what I believe was good work but the
founder was amazing and they're
deferring credit to their clients and
other people involved and they're not
ego- driven the best recruiters are
interested in one thing they have one
thing in their scorecard which is like
are my clients badass or not did they
make it or not and the problem in the
industry is like it's much it's way too
easy to get a bunch of transactions
totally 100K here 100K there 200k Here
 
like being a drug dealer house ex a
Conan and so you go well how do I not go
to sleep hating myself for being
overpaid I have to overd deliver the
high integrity people go okay my score
card is very simple how did my Founders
do they are my Founders when when a good
search firm takes on a company they need
to think of themselves as an extension
of that company as if they work within
those companies quote unquote walls that
company is their baby that company is
feeding their families putting food on
their table rent mortgages College to
 
your clients and people that have that
view everybody knows who they are it's
the people that care and they're
manifest that caring is manifesting how
well that their clientele due over the
years does that make sense yes thank you
thank you for validating that Andy you
had mentioned that 90% of the best
talent is currently employed um what I
continually hear right now in today's
market from Founders is oh there's so
much great talent on the market Market I
don't even need a search partner I'm
going to run this search on my own what
would you say to those people good luck
I mean we love it I mean like sometimes
I've seen go wow oh my God they got that
purse how they do that and I said okay
we did it in our Network or some Talent
partner at Andre or SEO or
whoever did an amazing job I mean you
grab somebody out of the network that
made sense yay that's what you want I
mean honestly as the I'm not really a VC
I do VC and recruiting kind of weaved in
I'm a company Builder or a helper to
founders of build companies don't really
have a title so don't think of me as
either one really yeah so a lot of
Founders right now are saying there's a
lot of great talent on the market I can
run this search on my own what would you
say to those people yay great good luck
this is how you should do it what
happens a lot of Founders get inbounds
from their VCS and go oh just call this
person go that person and the founder
thinks the VC will have vetted that
candidate when in reality they they may
or may not have maybe they came and said
look this person was the cro of my last
company they sold it for billions of
dollars it was a great company you
should 100% hire this person and if the
VC knew that person really well and was
able to give the founder you know an A+
deep reference then you can accelerate
your process avoid the headaches of a
search avoid the cost that is nirvana so
when I say that I'm not saying that as a
receipt or recruiter I'm saying that as
a helper to company Builders right to to
Founders it's like if you can avoid
doing a search you should the problem is
is a lot of these people will try I know
this one company is worth four plus
billion now on about 150 million AR
won't name the company they've been
trying to hire a cro for over a year on
their own failing miserably the person
who's in seat right now is killing it
and getting no credit it's amazing that
they've held on to the anything at all
you feel like the company might just hit
the wall any minute right after doing a
big financing and I think the real
challenge there is the Founder's
calculus was completely wrong oh I can
save time if I do it myself search this
will take three months I can do this in
one month and a year later they still
have not hired anybody that's a real
problem as you know hiring sneaks up on
you time is not your friend you have to
hire ahead of the actual need because
the people have to come in there's a
lead time they got to bring their people
with them hire them train them on board
them entertainment kind of goes all over
the place so just in the case of sales
so I always say to people try but fail
quickly if you're GNA fail having said
that no I'm not sitting there telling
Founders to in fact we helped the
founder that we're backing avoid a sales
search help them hire somebody that came
out of their netork
person was at home run GRE the company
from 1 to 15 to
 
worth you know it's a unicorn is a
really A+ Cloud company I mean it's this
guy and we're rooting for this guy all
the way so when you can avoid a search
and you get a high quality person should
abolutely do that the problem is the
founders just don't know how to score
the risk versus reward and the time
value if you get if you just fail to
actually hire that person last thing I'd
say is that what Founders don't know
they don't know what they don't know
they don't know when to do referencing
the candidate kind of wants to talk to
somebody else and be like hey this
founder kind of screwed something up I
met this person I really liked them can
I trust the founder to give them the
feedback I need a third party to broker
that feedback I me there's a lot of
things that you need from a third party
that they don't get so the founder will
be like oh I already hired somebody and
then on the one inch line the person
vaporizes and they wonder what happened
now they're starting from zero have to
go hire the search firm search from this
good is always sold out means a little
lead time to get started so you know you
can exponentially score your time Val
you in terms of lost opportunity and say
like okay for every month that I waited
I probably actually lost two or three
months yep I could not agree more with
the time thing it's like starting the
Titanic engine takes a while you know
what I mean and I I I I've always been a
fan of staying close with the search
firms that you work with you know always
have the wheels greased have lunch have
a drink have dinner understand what's
going on the market right I mean is you
don't have to that engine doesn't have
to go to a stop is what I'm saying and
that's been beneficial even when you
don't have a search exactly but like I
said there's an example I mean you know
I would love to name the company I'm
just itching to because this founder
This isra brilliant
 
are the you could probably guess who the
backers are and this guy popped tipped
in this Founders field he said what do
you think I said let me make two calls
for you made two calls they were A+ plus
back channels we said you know what we
can try for three or four months to hire
somebody that might be incrementally
better on this person or we can land
them and go for it we landed them went
for it and the
companies trounced every competitor by
Miles so that's an example of where like
okay if you can do it and you can do it
quickly and with conviction do it now
I'm going through all the companies in
my mind trying to guess it of course but
yeah I'm gonna stay on with you after I
think I know who it is okay so I want to
talk to you about up in Commerce and I I
think there's this big debate that's
gone on forever which is do we hire for
experience or do we hire for trajectory
I want to actually talk about one of
your recent LinkedIn posts that just
absolutely went off you describe a
situation where the up-and-comer gets
the opportunity to runs the show they
crush it for a few quarters but then
they miss badly and they don't know why
the CEO decides to layer the
up-and-comer in most situations the
upand comer leaves but what you're
describing in your post is a few recent
situations where the person puts their
ego aside and decides to stay for a year
or two learning from their new manager
what are these CEOs doing that are able
to keep these people around well it's
not just the CEOs are doing it it's the
person that's layering the incumbent
okay oh interesting important thing is
for the person I'll give you an example
of how it was really really well
recruted you guys know confluent when
Erica Schultz came in over Todd you know
Todd had done a great job he grew the
company from zero to 100 million that is
extremely hard as you know that's the
real work through the jungle with the
machete in Colombia kind of work like
it's brutal dangerous brutal perilous
okay hard those people are the heroes of
tech in my Minds The really early Nitty
Gritty greedy under the you know dirt
under the fingernail people but Erica
came in was like you know what just give
me a year you're GNA invest more stock
we'll figure things out it'll be a you
know they convinced those the founders
and the person who come in both go to
the existing person and say he thank you
for the amazing work as opposed to
here's where you screwed up and Todd
wasn't missing quarters per se it was
really just about how much can we build
capacity wise going forward and can we
look like a public company and do the
beat and Rays thing and the theory was
that Eric could do it in a way that the
incumbent couldn't do it and so at the
end of the day though hate to name names
but Todd was a total class out about it
stayed there made sure that his people
were cared for he was a total adult
about it and then Erica was smart
because she didn't come in saying oh I
just have to fire a bunch of people and
bring my own people in this is what the
standard operating procedure so you have
really two three players the incumbent
has to be an adult and care about the
company they just
bu two the person coming in has to be
classy humble listen treat them like a
partner three the founder has to support
this architecture and this ethos right
this approach to make sure it it lands
and you shouldn't be talking to
candidates that are going to top
somebody unless you're saying to them
how are you going to engage the existing
team because you know when you think
about engineering and sales right you
take those two functions that's usually
like 70% of an employee count you have a
few people in finance handful of people
in marketing some other things it's
usually R engineering and sales are the
big employment centers if you screw up
and and Mis orchestrate a hire in
leadership in either one of those
functions you could find yourself
getting cut in half which decreases
product velocity sales velocity all
kinds of chaos can occur so I just
believe in continuity and seamless
transitions I think those are the things
that I looked back on these companies
that made these great transitions in
snowflakes case they went through three
CEOs now they're on CEO number four
people don't realize it was sper then
muglia then slutman now Shri and so you
go okay well that's four CEOs in the
company never missed a beat datab bricks
second CEO people think Ali was the
original CEO is a second CEO pal Alta
Network through like five or six of them
these are A+ worldclass companies and so
they orchestrated these transitions
pretty well that that spoke to a pretty
strong board and a pretty strong
foundation and strong Founders but it
was about orchest ating kind of the new
person weaving in from the last person
and whether whatever function is whether
it's CEO or head of engineering or head
of sales these are high-risk situations
and people when people treat these
situations in a Cavalier way and then
they wonder why they blew up it's
because it was treated in a sloppy
Cavalier way I mean like this is not
rocket science yes the orchestration is
so important proactive thoughtful and
then the mindset and the ego which I
distilled from all those characteristics
you just said of all three of those
parties just has has everything to do
with it and everyone wins they become a
better leader long term they get
rewarded company goes better I've seen
it flame out the ego's high bad
orchestration show person leaves
because of that takes another CEO role
just to show their badass fails
miserably Flames out like it's it's bad
and so lot just has to do with just
people being try less elegant than they
need to be less thoughtful let's slow
down to go faster let's think this
through what is this organism called the
company x what is this company's
situation holistically and how can it
can it absorb the impact of a new player
and some disruption but you know trying
really hard to be thoughtful elegant and
pathetic I know these are kind of soft
words right now but like at the same
time I really believe that they matter
and studying people saying you know what
this person wasn't pect but damn it they
got us to 100 million bucks and they
slog through the trail of you know the
sewage to get here sha Shank Redemption
style I mean those people deserve a lot
of love and a lot of respect and a lot
of not empathy yeah some empathy but I
think at the end of the day some It
ultimately comes down to respect and
then they end up on a beach sandpaper in
a boat like he did at the end of
Shashank just to stick with the program
here it's so it's so well said Andy but
I I do feel like a lot of Founders get
really attached to the shiny new toy and
and they get really attached to like new
recruiting like new recruiting is
exciting it's it's fun and they forget
the people that got them there I I want
to quickly talk about this like
up-and-comer situation who gets layered
how involved should that person be in
the interview process yeah that's a good
question this is a tough one it goes
person by person Company by company some
people as you know are great performers
but they're innately insecure and so if
you tell them hey I'm going to go layer
you and you're the reasons they're even
if you're the most elegant person in the
world orchestration is Flawless but you
might still get a person who a premana
or just insecure and kind of lets their
insecurity run the thing and then they
leave it's like you can't help that in a
perfect world Founders have a lot of
trust with the person that they're
layering and say listen it's time for us
to bring in somebody quot unquote over
you but here's how I'm going to treat
you are you on board or they start
playing with the idea way before they
execute a plan test the person out feel
them out hey what what would you say
about bringing in somebody that you
might be able to learn from and then you
know a lot of times believe it or not
this the existing sales exe or existing
marketing exec whomever will be like you
know what I would love to learn from
Denise person from Snowflake about what
world class marketing looks like I'd
love to work for no one left snowflake
after the IPO no one and so why is that
because people and I ask these guys I'm
like you've already made all your money
why are you still there I mean I'm happy
they still there because it's company
I'm always going to care very deeply
about but they were like I'm learning
what world of class looks like and skill
looks like I can't learn that anywhere
else if I go do another start with
series a or series B sure I might make
more money but I'm not going to learn
what world class looks like so they
stayed for Frank so if you
organize you know the conversation early
enough and you're kind of treating it
almost like it's a theoretical situation
then you test the person person reacts
well then you go okay I've got a a clear
path to move forward but at the end of
the day you have to take care of your
business and if that means somebody is
tapping out here's one other thing I'll
say a lot of times the fix actually it's
very interesting there's another company
that's growing in a CO R is one of our
companies a venture and search firm
portfolio company and and what's
happening is the the people that are
getting layered are actually it's in
multiple situations and those
conversations are going on really early
where it's like okay we're going to take
care of you in this specific way and
this is what we're going to do and we're
going to have a long-term process and to
answer your question we are going to get
you involved in the recruiting process
you will absolutely get to meet your
boss but here's how you have to behave
you can't grill the person it's not your
role to eval Your Role is to get to know
and make sure you're comfortable with
this person but you can't sit there and
drill the person so it looks like the
fox is guarding the hand house and next
thing you know the candidate walks away
so to answer your question most
specifically you have to feel people out
see if they're going to be a team player
or not then make your plan from there
and the plan can go either confidential
search or open search and hey we're GNA
have some disruption but like I said not
thinking through these different things
and these different personalities where
people get in trouble and not setting
expectations I mean there's so many
searches where I had to jump in and like
have another pre-brief and have a chat
on the different roles of the different
interviewees and what's the and so many
people don't want to have that
conversation because it's not
comfortable that Andy you're going to
have lunch but you don't have a vote so
to speak in an elegant way but that
usually doesn't happen so they go to
lunch and they think they can veto the
thing and it just all goes to and
then you have to save it fix it rewind
and smooth it out but listen let's back
up for one second think about these
worldclass companies and what they had
in common what they had in common is
that they they had these seamless
transitions if you look at like for
example data bricks right so data bricks
brought in kofoid over gabris but gabris
is still there and it's really gabris
Go's show from a day-to-day execution
perspective and then Andy's obviously
getting the company IPO ready but that
partnership is like this right and you
know if you think about the McMahon and
Dean combination where a board member
mentoring a sales exective snowflake
these people are going into billions of
dollars of Revenue L performing didn't
need to get changed out what Founders
should do is study these successful
examples of continuity and say okay what
were these companies doing behaviorally
speaking who are the people there not
getting blown up or topped or whatever
and then what were the founders doing to
make sure that those people were
evolving appropriate along the growth
curve of the company like that's the
ultimate goal if in Nirvana you would
have no executive recruiters because you
would build a killer team early on maybe
the recruiters you got and you never
need the recruiters again through IPO
but that's that's not normal so I do
think that more studying of A+
situations where continuity was a major
theme and the early team is mostly
intact studying those situations is a is
a good place to start that is great
advice and feedback and So speaking of
like the Nirvana situation if I'm a
founder and I have a team of upand
comers what should I be doing to help
these people scale yeah you have to
bring in you have to invest in advisory
network and a solid board I mean you one
of the things that people do is like oh
let's bring this celebrity operator onto
the board celebr oper already the
person's already an existing CEO of a
public company has about one minute a
week just you know spend on this isn't
going to you know what we did with one
of our favorite investing Partners can
remain nameless we brought in one of the
best sales exacts in history guys
retired to be their operating partner
and teach them how to not screw up
hiring go to market hiring because when
you have an operator actually already
done it before they can zoom into a
situation and say you know what this
Andy price guy man he's not going to
make it he's just flaky he's not going
to do this you need to change him out or
hey this person's got there you know
what together you're the problem so you
kind of need that third party to a train
up the person B give the sanity check to
the founder that hey there are issues
that are Beyond this person's control or
we can build underneath them and let's
try that to a certain point build around
this human being so investing in your
existing EXA and knowing that they can't
do everything themselves when you hire a
VP of sales you can't expect them to do
world class as sales offs or rtion
productivity coverage comp the p&amp;l
attainment you can't expect them to do
all that and then hit a revenue uh
growth number that's always ridiculous
everybody's always got these ridiculous
expectations about 1% of them actually
hit or beat those expectations right and
so I think that the most important thing
is saying okay what do I do to equip
this person so that they can actually
shoot laser beams out of their eyes and
fly they don't just come into your
company with an s on their chest and a
red cape you've got help them right and
so I think that's what happens Founders
just go oh I expect this person to do
all these things and then they don't
invest in the team around them to
actually help them grow and they don't
they resist investing in that human so
they put more money into other things
and then they wonder why a person's
flaming out but there's always a story
that's way deeper than anybody's
advertising anytime a person's
quotequote vibrating or needing to be
replaced that story is where the rubber
meets the road getting to that story of
being like okay what really going on
here do we even really need to change
this person out at all or just truth you
know build up around them so that they
can go farther or Mentor them with an
advisory network or a board member that
is the best articulation for advisers
and coaches that I've ever heard and I I
just find that Founders think like these
people are going to come in and solve
all of their problems and it turns out
we're all people we all have strengths
we all have gaps and so ideally you're
finding advisers and coaches that can
round out the gaps and help improve
people in those areas so they can
continue to scale with the company and
augment the founders who usually are not
great at giving feedback developmental
feedback all these things they they
self-proclaim that too so well it's
because they have imposter syndrome
they're worried that if they say
something you're like hey Andy you're
not that great I'm sorry you're doing
really well here but there these issues
and the person's going to walk out the
door because insecure to know that the
person that they hired is actually an
adult probably and if you say something
in an authentic way that's data oriented
and not hyperbolic or you know overly
negative about some little tiny thing
and you're balanced about how you're
positioning the person hey these are the
things that are working these are things
that not working let's team up and
figure out how to address the things
that are not working they'll do a part
of that conversation but the holistic
conversation wasn't had so when you
diagnose bad hires and flameouts usually
it comes down to that you're absolutely
right to flag it that that if a person
was there for a year or two and then all
of a sudden they just kind of blew up it
was because a meaningful conversation
wasn't had and then upon they had to do
with let's make this person successful
take for example Schneider and Hy and
all these guys at um service now we're
talking about one of the best companies
in modern history it's what it worth 150
billion last these people built that
company from 60 million all the way
through and their prior company had
tapped out a 300 million got acquired by
MC it was a good run data domain they
were not equipped to run A1 billion do
company but slutman kept working on them
it kept working on the people Underneath
Him and they saw themselves as needing
to hire great people around them and
underneath them and service now invested
in the bench by the way they all also
just so you know a little wisdom to pass
on they were empowered to hire their own
people and build their own teams do
their own recruiting wasn't controlled
by centralized HR so they could shape
the teams in their own images in terms
of what they perceived they needed and
they turned out to be right so if you
look at Schneider and Hy and the team
that they built around them that system
that they built it endured far past them
leaving they brought the European guy
now he's the sales ex you know he's the
revenue exact so you have a lot of
continuity in another outsize absurdly
successful company had to do it
investing in the people around the key
leaders yep all right last topic I want
to hit is executive career management
and so my take is is like careers are a
game and I find that the best execs play
that game insanely well what are the
common patterns of how the best execs
manage their careers best execs are
somewhat selectively listening they're
never Outlook because why because they
chose a good company in the first place
and one the question is is that good
company starting to flame out or getting
acquired or taken private or whatever
what's their motivation for you know
moving on or they're going to say hey I
have this uh person I brought in
cultivated I'm now it's time for me to
go off and do another one because I'm
kind of bored and this is a little
programmatic for me and I want to grow
something again so when you think about
the motivations of people that's one
thing but in terms of them you know
managing their own careers the Smart
Ones watch the industry in their spare
time they they don't do it during their
work hours they're heads down operating
but then they take their spare time and
they're like hm interesting this
generative AI thing might turn into
something maybe I should watch open in
anthropic or we I should watch this
company that company or should I think
about workflow or should I think about
the tuning companies or should I think
about sras doing this
ridiculously screaming fast chip that
they buil how should I look at this
space because I think I want to
participate in it so they start studying
the category and building a little
thesis in their own minds about
companies they'd be open to and then
they hang on the right people there are
three or four go to market recruiters
that are get all the A+ late stage
things and there a bunch of them that do
the middle stage stuff bunch of them do
early stage knowing who to listen to and
build trust with it and then telling
those people don't ever call me about
companies like this I will it'll harm
our relationship they actually work with
Recruiters in a pretty bespoke way where
they say if you show me things like this
I'm more actively listening if you show
me things like that I literally don't
return your call and the smart
recruiters give them only the things
they ask for and then you have some ball
control on that person but in terms of
people managing their careers they're
always kind of looking okay spaces
should I be in this category is devops
going to be more interesting space than
generative AI is Big Data kind of
getting overwhelmed by you know AI which
is another way of thinking about Big
Data you in other words they're looking
at the categories in which they're Earth
currently operating or want to operate
and if you're at uh Verona for example
and you're doing data security posture
managing you might be like hum s and
these other guys are kind of coming up
the curve really fast and so what do I
do about that maybe is my founder on top
of this or is my CEO on top of this do
we have a game plan to save off the The
Horde or have I is this the end you know
with people at New Relic uh towards the
end were like God D dog is going to take
us you know take over the world the
Smart Ones saw that and the company
somewhat reacted they did some good
things they had a nice outcome but at
the end of the day people knew Dat Dog
was just going to win you could see it
and so I think that the smart people are
really aware of their own situation and
the
futility sometimes that of the situation
that they're in early and often and
either they do something to fix or they
okay I'm on the wrong horse and then I'm
going to move with this horse but they
have a point of view on the kinds of
things they're open to and why so I a
point of view was just in my head that's
so funny because I get questions hey
should I take these all these exec
recruiter calls I'm getting five a week
and like don't don't take a damn call
unless you have some point of view on
who you are what you're open to where
you're going why and what that looks
like because you're going to have to
answer those questions anyway and you
can spend all your time taking exec
recruiter calls my last question Andy is
about exact tenure you know back in the
day when I was young it was three to
five years it was this and then I've
heard it's all way to to one year is
acceptable and everything in between and
there's just a lot of noise out there on
tenure and whatnot I just love your
thoughts on that I I put out a LinkedIn
post I got so much hate on it one time I
was can't remember long goes my my 10
years ago might have been two months ago
about this topic I hate the one-year BS
it's like you can have one or two of
those in your career you have three or
four just it tells you everything about
somebody and then somebody was like oh
it has to do with the psycho founder
like no it does not if you are smart and
you're are judicious you know how to vet
a human being otherwise why why does
anybody give you the right to hire
anybody if you're not a judge of
character you shouldn't have the right
to be a manager or a VP or a C Level
whatever totally so you should be look
in the eyes of the founder ask them
questions test them one other thing I'll
quickly say is people don't ask each
other hard questions early on enough and
gauge how the other person can handle a
hard question that's really important
and so I think tenure has to do with
people being flaky and be like oh okay
well I'm going to go make this money
there make this money there and they're
like little squirrels running around the
forest blindly trying to grab the acorns
stuff them in the tree for the harsh
winter and they're scrambling around but
there's no game plan there right like
they're not the alpha the forest for a
reason they're lower on the food chain
so when you think about the people that
really kick ass you look at their career
trajectories they may go through four or
five major runs three four five six
years a piece 20 years too long five
years yay one year you like I said
things go crazy company can get acquired
they can run out of money there's all
this volatility in the industry 100%
give people some passes for these couple
these things here and there but if you
have a succession of onee things it's
like I don't want to see or buy have
some better judgment come back to me I
always tell people when they hit me in
LinkedIn I'm like I'm sorry but your bio
is like a dog's breakfast you've done
nothing you need to go do something with
someone else then come back to us in
three years when you've gone and killed
it somewhere and proven you can stay
somewhere and make a contribution in a
year you can barely find your way to the
office in the first year I mean come on
totally well I was expecting a strong
strong response here and I got it so
thank you we didn't even I'm serious
like the people we all aspire to and we
all earn we all admire most people I
know in the industry do admire people
with grit determination that did hard
things very well and you can only do
hard things very well over an arc of
time it's not a one year you can't do
any meaningful impact in a year I just
really believe that I don't really care
if people agree with me or not I okay
resilience is definitely coming back in
style and I think that's actually been
one of the one of the nice things from
this macro environment is like those
people that are persisting are going to
have great stories to tell just like you
absolutely people like Millennials and
these geners man people always hate on
these kids one of the things they will
say is that they really value
authenticity authenticity is like the
number one buzz word them it's getting
old for some people I'm like I'm it's
not getting old to me at all
authenticity is like if that's your core
belief that authenticity is like number
one factor then you have more you know
more real conversations with people and
you you can actually work your way
through things you're not pretending
there's no BS in sight if you have that
true north so I actually think that the
industry is been driven that way largely
by the by the obsession with
authenticity from the Millennials which
they passed down to these gen zers the
best gen Z people think about that first
and they know they have to live it too
yep Andy you're a legend thank you so
much for the time today thanks so much
