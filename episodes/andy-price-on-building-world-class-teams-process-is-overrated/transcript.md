really excited to get into the
nitty-gritty of executive recruiting
 
nitty-gritty of executive recruiting
especially from you so I want to start
 
especially from you so I want to start
with uh some of my learnings at door Das
 
with uh some of my learnings at door Das
I worked really closely with Tony and he
 
I worked really closely with Tony and he
always said the Michael Jordan of exec
 
always said the Michael Jordan of exec
recruiting gets it right two out of
 
recruiting gets it right two out of
three times why is the hit rate for
 
three times why is the hit rate for
execs so low um for him it might be
 
execs so low um for him it might be
two-thirds because he's one of the best
 
two-thirds because he's one of the best
Founders in ever I think that guy is a
 
Founders in ever I think that guy is a
superstar and a great human and is
 
superstar and a great human and is
really committed to building an A+ team
 
really committed to building an A+ team
and he's thoughtful very thoughtful
 
and he's thoughtful very thoughtful
about hiring as you know so I would say
 
about hiring as you know so I would say
two-thirds in the world of Tony is one
 
two-thirds in the world of Tony is one
thing the reality is like most often I
 
thing the reality is like most often I
mean I had a partner with one of the
 
mean I had a partner with one of the
best Venture firms in history one of the
 
best Venture firms in history one of the
top two probably guess which one it is
 
top two probably guess which one it is
say to me we get hiring right onethird
 
say to me we get hiring right onethird
of the
 
of the
time so I think that the reason for that
 
time so I think that the reason for that
is very simple it's like if you look at
 
is very simple it's like if you look at
humans and then you look at companies
 
humans and then you look at companies
you have complex organisms right every
 
you have complex organisms right every
human is a complex collection of
 
human is a complex collection of
molecules of strung together right and
 
molecules of strung together right and
the same thing is true of companies
 
the same thing is true of companies
although what you do is you look at
 
although what you do is you look at
companies there are far more complex
 
companies there are far more complex
than any individual human being so if
 
than any individual human being so if
you thought about this as a parallel to
 
you thought about this as a parallel to
like genomics for example right and
 
like genomics for example right and
you're going okay can we understand
 
you're going okay can we understand
genomics and then figure out like how to
 
genomics and then figure out like how to
build drugs that fit this person's
 
build drugs that fit this person's
specific genic profile thereby
 
specific genic profile thereby
increasing efficacy then you say okay
 
increasing efficacy then you say okay
that's a huge win in healthcare so by a
 
that's a huge win in healthcare so by a
parallel to making hiring go to more
 
parallel to making hiring go to more
like three out of three as opposed to
 
like three out of three as opposed to
one out of three although Tony's again
 
one out of three although Tony's again
being generous at two3 you know you
 
being generous at two3 you know you
really would have a tough time the
 
really would have a tough time the
reality is is that there's so many
 
reality is is that there's so many
variables that throw off because you
 
variables that throw off because you
could have a great candidate right and a
 
could have a great candidate right and a
great company and yet those two just
 
great company and yet those two just
don't make it because of variables you
 
don't make it because of variables you
cannot possibly see in my mind the
 
cannot possibly see in my mind the
mitigation factors are really
 
mitigation factors are really
understanding who you are as an
 
understanding who you are as an
organization what you need in the
 
organization what you need in the
standard BS like oh this culture and
 
standard BS like oh this culture and
this person has to be a culture fit
 
this person has to be a culture fit
usually your culture is wrong or it's
 
usually your culture is wrong or it's
immature or it's like incomplete or it's
 
immature or it's like incomplete or it's
a collection of subcultures and it needs
 
a collection of subcultures and it needs
to evolve here and the EXA supposed to
 
to evolve here and the EXA supposed to
take you there but the resistance to
 
take you there but the resistance to
that you know impact that these people
 
that you know impact that these people
are here to make right there there's no
 
are here to make right there there's no
exec that's hired that's not there to
 
exec that's hired that's not there to
improve something right or change
 
improve something right or change
something so by definition everyone's
 
something so by definition everyone's
into change management without even
 
into change management without even
really even being able to articulate
 
really even being able to articulate
that so I feel like mitigating these uh
 
that so I feel like mitigating these uh
blowups is all
 
blowups is all
about being really pragmatic as opposed
 
about being really pragmatic as opposed
to quote unquote aspirational about
 
to quote unquote aspirational about
whether or not the person coming in your
 
whether or not the person coming in your
company or the company you're joining if
 
company or the company you're joining if
you're the candidate you know are going
 
you're the candidate you know are going
to be this perfect harmonious situation
 
to be this perfect harmonious situation
you have to strap in for some vibrations
 
you have to strap in for some vibrations
and wildness and chaos and ambiguity in
 
and wildness and chaos and ambiguity in
order to be pragmatic about okay no
 
order to be pragmatic about okay no
there not perfect and neither are we
 
there not perfect and neither are we
let's try to figure out how we mesh
 
let's try to figure out how we mesh
together and give this person a chance
 
together and give this person a chance
to succeed does that make sense and the
 
to succeed does that make sense and the
fact that the industry is so immature
 
fact that the industry is so immature
still around organization development HR
 
still around organization development HR
processes on boarding stuff like that
 
processes on boarding stuff like that
those are all factors in why you have
 
those are all factors in why you have
what I call tissue rejection so I want
 
what I call tissue rejection so I want
to know what you do to try and mitigate
 
to know what you do to try and mitigate
that so walk us through you you close a
 
that so walk us through you you close a
client now we're about to kick off a
 
client now we're about to kick off a
search together what is your process to
 
search together what is your process to
try and mitigate that outcome yeah so

just quick detail I I run our fund I do
not even run our search firm what I do
 
not even run our search firm what I do
is I help with every search that's
 
is I help with every search that's
meaningful effective you know mostly the
 
meaningful effective you know mostly the

artisanal kicks off a search what is the
 
artisanal kicks off a search what is the
artisanal process to mitigate a bad
 
artisanal process to mitigate a bad
executive outcome good question I think
 
executive outcome good question I think
the best way to mitigate a bad out is
 
the best way to mitigate a bad out is
you actually have to Silk with a company
 
you actually have to Silk with a company
so when we designed our search firm it
 
so when we designed our search firm it
was always with the view that if you had
 
was always with the view that if you had
more time to dedicate to an existing
 
more time to dedicate to an existing
company then you would actually
 
company then you would actually
understand what's really going on what
 
understand what's really going on what
happens in most exec searches founder
 
happens in most exec searches founder
will get on a call because the VC said
 
will get on a call because the VC said
call recruiter X Y or Z and there's some
 
call recruiter X Y or Z and there's some
really great ones out there the great
 
really great ones out there the great
ones that I know that are competitors to
 
ones that I know that are competitors to
our search firm
 
our search firm
artisanal have this exact same thing in
 
artisanal have this exact same thing in
common with artisanal which is like okay
 
common with artisanal which is like okay
let's just let's do not just one fly by
 
let's just let's do not just one fly by
meeting okay I need this okay great
 
meeting okay I need this okay great
we'll go find that person for us send us
 
we'll go find that person for us send us
a contract we'll go find some people for
 
a contract we'll go find some people for
you that's like a simplistic way of
 
you that's like a simplistic way of
going and it's a reckless approach the
 
going and it's a reckless approach the
better thing to do is go okay what are
 
better thing to do is go okay what are
you doing tell me everything's wrong
 
you doing tell me everything's wrong
with you tell me all your warts all your
 
with you tell me all your warts all your

problems all the things that are not
working don't tell me how awesome your
 
working don't tell me how awesome your
company is tell me where it's going to
 
company is tell me where it's going to

go wrong so more we understand that the
more a we can say okay the candidate's
 
more a we can say okay the candidate's
smart if they're good they're smart
 
smart if they're good they're smart
they're going to figure this out on
 
they're going to figure this out on
their own let's mitigate the concerns
 
their own let's mitigate the concerns
ahead of time so we can actually close
 
ahead of time so we can actually close
them once they've been closed how they
 
them once they've been closed how they
are successful is they understand the
 
are successful is they understand the
work ahead of them that means pulling
 
work ahead of them that means pulling
out of the company what is up with your
 
out of the company what is up with your
company what are your hopes yes and
 
company what are your hopes yes and
where are your points of failure so if
 
where are your points of failure so if
you really holistically understand the
 
you really holistically understand the
company and then you go out for the
 
company and then you go out for the
candidate so that's the company side you
 
candidate so that's the company side you
have to soak with these companies and
 
have to soak with these companies and

and the founders have to be super
transparent and build some trust with
 
transparent and build some trust with
the recruiters and say look I'm not
