# Controversial Stance: Job Seekers Should Know About this Bias

## Transcript

 
so Nolan how did Business Insider get to
you on the open to work yeah on LinkedIn
I'm curious how that since I was
surprised to see it so interestingly
enough CNBC actually reported it first
and I have a relationship with the
reporter and so she pings me probably
like once every three months to get my
feedback on topics as it relates to
people and what's happening in the job
market but I want to take a minute to to
run through the facts of what actually
happened because I think you see what's
happen on LinkedIn and then there's this
whole like from where I stand what
actually happened so just facts I had
interview with CNBC I told the reporter
that the open to work feature on
LinkedIn is the worst feature ever
pushed to production for any social
media site I said that because I think
it hurts job Seekers and the reason why
it hurts job Seekers is because many and
I mean literally dozens of hiring
managers and Founders have told told me
that they feel like people who put that
on their LinkedIn are desperate the
reporter didn't get my quote like
exactly right so like I'm not going to
like get into that but anyways they ran
the story article goes live and many HR
pros and recruiters vly disagreed with
me and I think they had like two points
of view um one is from the recruiting
standpoint well no it's easier to find
people that are open to work if they put
the banner on there and like LinkedIn
prioritizes those people what I would
say to that is is that's objectively
true but recruiters are not decision
makers in the hiring process and so I'm
literally giving a perspective from the
hiring manager and founder seat the
second piece of feedback is I would
summarize it as Nolan is punching down
and so the feedback was like it's very
harmful that you're putting this out
there it's misogynistic it's outdated
it's super biased and my response to
that is
I want people to know what hiring
decision makers are thinking and I was
very direct with what I said but the
intent of what I said was not to be
biased it's actually to call out the
bias so people see
it and they're aware of it and now
people can make a decision and that's
what I think is actually good about what
happened so anyways Insider did pick it
up they have 11 million followers on
LinkedIn and that's when it like went
hyperv viral and I became the villain on
link in yeah um but any that's that's
the reason why I out there so people can
see it well the thing so I I started
seeing a bunch of pings and this and
that I like what is going what is he
doing what is he doing now and I I I
thought about this a lot the past few
days and talked to some folks I mean the
good news is you you had good intent
like you have good intent right you're
trying to help you're trying to call
something out that you've seen so others
can learn from it and we can kind of fix
it or they can make a decision that that
that was your intent not to punch down
and say this is what this is what
happens but this is what could happen
you should be aware of it and make a
decision I I think if the feature hurts
more than one person it's probably no
longer needed and when it first came out
like let's go back when it came out in
 
necessary like a ton of people had lost
their jobs like overnight and that
actually was expeditious for recruiters
yeah we're now years beyond that and so
how how the open to work Banner uh how a
hiring manager USS that Banner is now
different three years in the the other
thing I'll say is like on fixing bias I
was probably one of the first people at
Google to go through the um the bi the
the bias training for interviewers yep I
did this in like
 
made much progress and it's not for lack
of attempt it's because human bias is
encoded into our
DN and fixing that is going to take
decades and I am all about doing that
work there are many people that are
doing that work we should keep going but
if people are getting hurt today not
saying something is worse than knowing
it and keeping it to myself yeah look I
applaud you for saying it I think
there's a lot of folks out there on all
different parts right of this of this
side and they're bringing their own
experiences to the table when they're
reading it or agreeing or disagreeing so
I'm always G to I'm always going to like
kind of go at you with the it's not a
one-size fits all dude it it never it
never never is now I will tell you I
disagree on it's 3 years later like
being in HR and seeing Informatica just
laid off 10% their Workforce like 2 days
ago totally or whatever it was so that
is not over and the altruism and the
community like help that I've seen on
LinkedIn with everyone trying to help
each other it is still going on is is
like nothing I've ever seen like I
haven't seen that on LinkedIn in my how
long is LinkedIn but like I've been
doing this 23 years and the level of
like wildfire community help and support
for people that have been losing their
jobs especially over the last 12 18
months yeah it's very big so I think
honestly Nolan you're you're getting a
lot of blowback on that because your
comments were seen as insensitive yep to
those that got screwed over by all this
nonsense totally and the audience can
disagree with me I think if you would
have posted that three years ago or
four years ago you wouldn't have heard
anything uh you think so I I think that
people would not be as heightened to it
because the market was much different
and I I do I think well the banner only
came out during the pandemic well just I
know but I'm just saying what if it was
there 5 years ago I don't think you
would have gotten a lot of blowback
because people literally yeah are not in
the same it's the moment you're saying
it's the moment and I think the
environment has a lot to do with it and
I think and I've helped a ton of
people in LinkedIn that lost their jobs
and I think people are speaking up for
other people now I will tell you and
people might disagree with
me as an
executive I wouldn't put that on there
why
not I well so first of all I don't
really think about it right so you
mentioned this and I agree with it
networking working your networks Making
Connections talking to people cold out
bounding hiring manag I just that's what
all I would think of I probably wouldn't
even think of changing my yep I I didn't
even know the feature freaking existed
to be honest like in until recently like
so there there's that piece of it but
that being said like the industry people
are in the job function people are in
the levels of these of these roles and
like whether you're full-time or
temporary or consultant like these are
all factors that like come on we're all
reasonable this can't be a black or
white issue it depends for hiring
managers especially for early stage
startups they are biased what I am
saying is is people should be aware of
that and that there is a conversation
happening that they don't know about and
now I'm telling and look in parallel I
think there's a lot of things as a like
I got a lot of feedback on like well
Nolan you should be helping people
that's my intent you're trying and I
actually totally agree that school does
not prepare people to go find a job like
the number one question I get from
college kids is how should I get a job
how do I get my foot in the and so I
actually have t talked a lot about this
historically but I think like it's a
problem with our educational system is
we don't teach people applicable skills
that they're going to use to make a
living the other thing I just noticed
from this conversation is there is a
monoculture of thought in HR and I I
came in from a different angle on this
and I pissed that monoculture off and
that's one of the reasons why we started
this podcast is because we wanted to we
wanted to have more of a discussion and
to to illuminate that there's other
points of view to get things done and as
I told people on LinkedIn look I'm
optimizing for Speed here I could have
chosen my words better it could have
been quoted better but I'm optimizing
for Speed and letting people know and
try to help them yeah but look the the
bottom line for me is it's a data point
like your opinion on this like whether
you disagree or agree any reasonable
person would agree that shit's out there
so you should be you should be aware of
it take it or leave it but exactly that
that it it is it is real in some respect
and that that's my biggest takeaway is
it should be in in the consideration set
then um you know it's funny like you
said
recruiters see this but the higher
managers make the
decision again I could get chastised for
this but if I if I like pulled every
recruiter at pendo I bet you a lot of
them would be like I don't even really
mention that to the hiring manager like
the hiring manager's looking on LinkedIn
Kelly like every I've never had a i'
I've never in the three years this damn
features been out I've never had a hire
manager say oh the circle green like
forget it I and I've never even noticed
myself when I've been hiring people I
literally like yeah it again it's like
whether you're looking or not I want
that person because they're the best
person for this job yeah and that is
that is the way the world should work
all the time my comments were to State
the way the way the world works is not
like that all the time I'm just telling
you in my career boots on the ground
scaling these damn companies I've never
had a hiring manager say the circle's
Green Forget it okay I'm GNA introduce
you to some of the people that I know I
want I mean right The Point again I
don't care the point is not to not to
shun disagree or agree the point is to
understand everything that's out there
that's how you educate people and that's
what you're trying to do yep I I
appreciate the discussion I appreciate
you still befriending me um yeah and I
want to hear from all the audience too
like same am I full of yep and I do
appreciate everyone's discussion and
comments I appreciate you thank you
