all right everyone HR heritch special
segment we are welcoming back a
boomerang guest Janelle Lopez who was
here with us when was it Janelle early
February so about yeah over three months
ago plus or minus yeah and if you
remember Janelle came on as she was
going through her search and the
conundrum of whether she wanted to go
for a number one Chief people officer
role for the first time or take a big
number two job at a larger company
underneath a chief people officer a lot
of folks are going through this and
obviously still are and the wisdom that
you unleashed the vulnerability of what
you were kind of weighing and some of
the struggles of of that Journey was
really helpful so since then Janelle has
taken a number two rooll at
corsera and has been there for about
what three months
now just just approaching my second
month
SOB I love it I love it so tell us
because I remember you were you were
kind of hellbent on the number one role
when we talked three months ago but you
were talking to both opportunities and
you had both opportunities so tell us
what what changed how did you come to
that conclusion what was the process you
went through yeah and I think first
thanks for having back I'm excited to be
here and I think Kelly my journey to
landing at corsera was months and months
of preparation and networking as you you
know when we talked about I think in
total the last four months as part of my
search I talked to Upward of 75 people
went through six multi-round processes
and I think the roles where I had the
most traction ultimately were those that
were most connected to my network so I
know you and Nolan spend a ton of time
on the show talking about the importance
of putting yourself out there being
intentional about who you meet new
connections and I couldn't agree more
with that approach I think relationships
matter and taking the time to Foster
them is no matter where you are in your
journey whether you're looking whether
you're in your role that you're happy
with take the time to do it it's so
important and I think you know the
advice that nol in particular gave me
when we talked last is are you settling
for a number two role and don't settle
if you really really want that number
one job
and I have to be honest that was
constantly in the back of my head as I'm
looking at number two type roles leading
a business partner team in a similar
capacity that I did for so long at
Survey Monkey and if you had to ask me
now do I feel that I settled I don't do
I still feel that I'm going to find
success in a number one job at some
point absolutely and I think for me it
was less about the job title and level
but more around a few key drivers that
were most important to me and where I
landed next which is something that I
felt really connected to the mission a
place where the people function was
valued and had credibility and respect
by the executive team and the CEO again
that is so important to me because
otherwise it it's going to be an uphill
battle going in there and I think that
is something that was deeply important
to me I've seen that done really well
and I Know It enables the function to
find the most success I also was looking
for a place where my experience could be
uniquely positioned to drive the
business forward and a role that would
teach me add to my skills of people
leadership and allow me to step into the
top job more seamlessly when I'm ready
to do so so that's kind of what went
into my thought process again those key
drivers no matter what the role was
continue to be important to me in
finding my next opportunity totally and
if I have to channel Nolan he's sick
today which is why it's you and I he
would say did you settle do you feel
like you settled and what I'm hearing
you say is a lot of those criteria and
the reasons you took this job at corsera
are a lot of the same criteria for the
number one role exactly it was in a
different environment yeah and and I
could have taken a number one role that
maybe didn't fill all those things that
were really important to me and maybe I
would have felt like I was settling just
because my aspirations were to land that
type of job yeah and and tell tell tell
us how you assessed cuz you mentioned it
was the right environment the people
team was well respected you felt like
this is going to prep you for that
number one job how did you sus that out
with your new boss your Chief people
officer and the
organization yeah I think it is it was
asking some really hard questions Kelly
and not being intimidated or scared by
what I learned right because I think the
reality
is every company is going through a
period of change and transformation
right now and I think assuming that any
company is immune from that is the wrong
mindset so I went in with some really
hard-hitting questions to really
understand what am I walking into and I
think to me those types of roles is
really where I feel that my leadership
experience is most needed where I'm
going to have the most opportunities to
influence and drive change and so I
think it was more to your point making
sure that I asked the hard questions I
spent enough time with the team that I
would be in the trenches with and what
is the where is the business opportunity
as well and when where is the business
struggling and how can we Bridge people
you know initiatives leadership
relationships to help Foster and push
the business forward can you you know we
like to push on this show you got one or
two of those hard
questions um I think something along the
lines of you and Nolan talk talked about
like why shouldn't I take this role
right and I think it's being very
vulnerable in some way is you know be
really really honest with me like if you
you were to give me some honest advice
and I think it's okay to ask those hard
questions and I think it's okay you know
to push the CPO that you're interviewing
with on be very honest and real with me
because again you don't want a candidate
to walk in on day one and feel they were
misso the role and I think it's our role
when we're interviewing challenge them
and push them to give you the context
you need totally and I'm assuming like
doing that what could be you know
exhausting semi awkward work upfront
with these hard questions a lot of time
you probably felt better day one like
you were already a part of the team it
probably made your onboarding easier
yeah absolutely and I think walking in
when a company is going through
transformation and change like I feel
that I'm somewhat unfazed by it because
I felt like I really knew what I was
walking into versus being surprised
because I didn't ask the right questions
or I didn't ask the hard
questions hey everyone we'll be right

[Music]
 
you and you mentioned 75ish
conversations before you landed on your
next opportunity which sounds exhausting
and a lot and you mentioned the
networking the you said this took months
of networking what does that mean for
people that are listening what what do
you mean by networking what did you do
because I think it's such a good point
i' left drilling on yeah and when I say
 
that doesn't mean that I had 75
interviews right I think all of those
conversations led me ultimately to
Landing interviews and I think Kelly
it's a mix
of who have I worked with in the past
what is some of the people leadership
teams that I've worked with that I know
of in the network who are the VC
connections that I've been introduced to
fostering those relationships people who
have been in advisor capacity um and I
think it's a variety of not just people
leaders but Business Leaders right
former heads of Finance former Chief
Revenue officers and really you know
developing that Network asking questions
what are you seeing what are you hearing
what are the gaps and and just taking
the time to do it and I think that was
so informative even before I started
interviewing for roles because I really
just wanted to feel like I had a good
grasp on what is the market what is the
landscape what are people looking for
this at this point in time for people
stepping into those top jobs and so yes
some of it was friends peers mentors but
then I think where you have to get
really vulnerable is making
introductions to VCS to advisors to
people leaders you don't even know and I
think that is was really important to me
it was definitely not an area of comfort
I had a step outside of my comfort zone
but I think I was really pleased with
the receptiveness and willingness for
people to connect with me and I strive
to do as well because I felt it was so
valuable um for people to take 15
minutes with me it doesn't have to be a
long conversation I think I think that
is such an important point and something
that I I didn't really learn till a bit
later in my career right which is it is
not about networking with just HR people
or exec recruiters right you and I
talked I was like forget that go to the
VCS go to here right and and and to your
point how willing these people are to
connect and meet you and learn and talk
with you which you might think the
opposite definitely and another thing
that I was very intentional with is when
I finally landed at corera is circling
with a lot of people and just thanking
them for the time here's where I landed
you know and all of the them were so
gracious and said I'm so excited let's
keep in touch I'd love to continue to
hear how it's going there you know and I
think that is really important and again
I know another area we you've talked
about in the show is making sure that
you're making the connections and
fostering those relationships because it
is so important and whether you it leads
you to a new opportunity down the road
or just hey I have this problem I'd love
your perspective on it have you ever
experienced this and I think that is
again that's who I am as a person and
being able to build and maintain those
relationships but it doesn't come
without effort right you have to be
intentional about it I I just want to
take a huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] highlighter and we
didn't even plan this and you said
Circle back follow up um give back
cultivate these relationships which is
the work versus taking something and
running and and that that is probably
the biggest secret sauce as far as
networking in my opinion and Janelle and
I worked together years ago were big
fans of followup right Circle back the
follow you have to do that with
networking and give back and check in
even when you don't need anything at all
exactly so um did you learn anything
about the job market in your 75
conversations anything you'd offer the
audience or advice you got or Trends or
things you're seeing as far as what's
going on out there right now yeah I mean
not it's it's tough out there right it
was brutal and I think there's an
incredible talent pool and I touched on
this before and I think it still remains
true is approach each interview each
conversation as a learning opportunity
ask a really hard questions
practice your pitch refine your story
and I think I will be the first to say
you will be disappointed when you do not
get a role that you thought was the one
or you thought it was the perfect fit
but I guarantee when you do find the
right role you're going to look back at
all those rejections and be like this
was for this reason why I didn't get it
and it just feels right so I don't think
I learned anything new or different that
I didn't share the first time Kelly I
just think it's really again putting
yourself out there being vulnerable in
those conversations and again finding
something that works for you and not so
focused on maybe what you set out to do
but more so think about what are the key
things that are most important to you
and does that role fulfill those and is
it going to propel you to doing
something great down the road yep
getting reps is half the battle you know
y okay so last question before we wrap
up what's next um what's your map in
this role what's your path why are you
feeling right about this yeah right now
I'm really happy with where I am and I'm
excited for the work ahead at corsera I
think I haven't lost sight of wanting a
run-of-the top job and I
think that will happen when it's
supposed to if it's supposed to down the
road and I think I can continue to be
driven by new experiences building new
relationships inserting myself in a way
that allows me to get closer to another
business to understand how it works
what's working what's not and developing
a team
and I think those things are really
important to me and corera right now is
providing me these opportunities and I'm
really energized by the new opportunity
and challenge I love it I love it well I
think I speak for everyone when I say
we're all excited to follow you and
watch your career and cheer when you um
grow into that number one role and the
great work you'll do at corsera um thank
you for coming back for another round
I'm sure we'll so much for me round
three and all right thanks all have a
good day thank you
