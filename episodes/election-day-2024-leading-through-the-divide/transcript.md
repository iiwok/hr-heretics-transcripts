what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics today is
November 5th and it is election day in
the United States so Kelly I want to
take 15 20 minutes and talk about how
best we can prepare for this wild
election I I'll just actually lead off
with like something that I think is
really important that I don't think many
people are processing which is this
feels like one of those elections that
like half of the country is going to
lose and I don't think they're really
prepared for losing it really feels like
if your side loses you are going to feel
just devastated and
crushed and you know I'm just going to
say I'm going to lead this thing off
with by saying I think the number one
thing that you can prepare for yourself
for this week as we go into whoever wins
is just prepare for your side to lose
prepare for the country to continue to
move forward and just think about like
how you're going to process that and
interact with your neighbors with your
colleagues with your family because
ultimately these are elections we have
them every four years but this one feels
like a little bit different to
me it does I mean I you know wouldn't
say that
I'm extremely obsessed with politics and
whatnot for a variety of reasons but I
have been listening and following this
one more closely than others in the past
and I do feel like it seems heavier
and it doesn't you know no matter who
you want to win or whatnot like the
winner almost scares me less than how
the country moves forward exactly to
your
point because the I mean the issues are
heavy the intensity is heavy I think
the opposition right if you're on one
side of the other the almost anger and
towards the other side and I understand
why I'm not discounting that I'm just
saying it's so potent that I worry about
how we move forward so my mind is
already you know beyond the winner
because no matter if Trump or Kamala
wins we got to figure this out and this
feels extremely divided yeah totally
they're the is like so amped up there's
so much like ad homonym you know
personal
attacks um and this is on both sides
right like this is not like one side is
absolved from this like this is
happening like all over the goddamn
place now and I think the craziest part
is you know we've gone from politics
kind of being like a you know we used to
use the term presidential a lot right
and in the era of social media and in
the era of memes
it turns out like presidential doesn't
really sell anymore the stuff that sells
is the you know like taking ad homonym
attacks um really going after your
opponent in like dirty ways um because
then you can create this like you know
it's little meme that you can put on
Twitter or a Tik Tok um and then like
that gets people all riled up and
excited and you know ultimately like I
can complain about like the state of our
politics all day long and would complain
about that to you cuz I think it's
awful but this is just the world that
we're now living in and so I think the
thing people need to really think about
is how am I going to process this and
expecting the worst situation for you
personally so the thing I've been
thinking about over the course of the
last couple of months is like well if
the person who I'm voting for loses what
am I going to do and honestly I think
the thing I'm going to do is just try
and get behind our new president because
what the hell else am I going to do just
this expect things to be mad about not
getting my way uh I I just think like in
moments like this when we are so
divisive the thing that we can do is
just completely buck that Trend and just
whoever wins let's just go support that
person we're all Americans at the end of
the day and let's hope that they're
successful because that's how our
country is going to be successful and
that's what scares me that's what scares
me is
that you know what scares me know that
the damage has already been done as far
as the divisiveness yeah and I'm just
going to be honest I feel like this
election these debates these campaigns
like it doesn't matter if it when it was
Biden or or Kamala like I feel like
we've let the toothpaste out of the tube
and giving
people permission to
just be hateful and be angry and I don't
know if you want to call it like true
colors or whatnot but I just feel like
it's gotten out of hand and I feel like
this process has enabled and allowed
that and I fear that will
continue after the election's over no
matter who wins and one example that hit
me the other day you know obviously
listen to podcast kind of have to but I
was listening to a podcast and they were
saying if you look at you know Kamas
going in all these podcasts Trump's
winning all these podcasts and they're
like hanging out with their own gender
and like their own people and like K is
going on all these female podcasts and
Trump's going on all these male podcasts
and the young male voter I'm
generalizing but like more young male
voters now are getting behind Trump
because of all like we are
undoing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that like I think we
tried to be better in the past you know
X number of years that's not a good
process if you want to do it like she
should go on the male podcast he should
go on the female podcast and talk about
things that
are opposite of what they're talking
about and what we try to do on this
podcast understand the other View and
have a professional conversation
because like when I think about like if
I was going to be president I don't
think about all the people that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
support me and that are like me I think
about how I'm going to lead and support
and rally the people that don't believe
in me or like me so like you know again
this homogeneous situation we have I
just feel like
it makes me sad because I think a lot of
progress has been undone just through
this process I agree I totally agree
with you it it honestly feels like the
tents are getting smaller you know like
it used to be like we want to expand the
tent and let more people into the tent
and now it feels like you know the tents
are getting a lot smaller and they're
essentially like Polar Opposites in many
ways I would except for the rhetoric I
think the rhetoric is really bad um on
both sides it's honestly like especially
over the course of this like last week
like leading up to election day good God
the r has gotten so bad and so divisive
it's like a it's like a race to the
bottom honestly no it's embarrassing
like and I'll just go back to this isn't
about any one person this isn't about
Kamala Trump Biden but I'll go back to
that Biden Trump debate like I was
disgusted at to your point the level
which they took these conversations and
the these attacks like those of you in
the audience like we are all Business
Leaders right we are held to standards
of professionalism you work in your
organizations you it's civility it's
again just a common courtesy and respect
even for those you disagree with they're
talking about who's better at golf
they're talking about who's better
looking I heard on one freaking thing
how someone laughs is being talked about
across the country for one of our
like partic like it's just unacceptable
and I'm just telling you if we would in
there and started doing this in our
organizations we'd be
fired hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline line hiring teams can
make confident informed decisions and
talent leaders can finally take control
of the interview process join Forward
Thinking Talent leaders at high
performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and por and check out
metaview head over to metav view. a/
Heretics to talk to one of metav VI's
product experts or get started for free
you'll be uppr running an AI enabled in
minutes yeah it's yeah I mean they're
talking about a lot of things I me
they're comparing rallies to Nazi
Germany like it is so wild how bad it's
gotten and we're accept that's okay I'm
just it really boggles my mind here's
the thing I would say Kelly is like all
right so you know the majority of our
listeners um you know you you're you're
working class professionals like
typically you work in Tech um you know
typically like you're trying to get
ahead you know you want to figure out
like how to operate with other people
and so here's what I would say here's
how here's the way I'm thinking about
this for my own world which is like one
like be aware
of how social media and traditional
media is going to warp you for the next
few days like do you really want to be
spending all of your time watching CNN
is that how you want to like comprehend
what's going on here and I know it like
fires up like you know all of the
receptors in our brain is like gambling
right it's like me and you are big
gamblers Kelly like I get to at the
table like all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] day that was a
secret sorry I outed you um
but it turns out that election results
do the same thing I have done this in
past elections to where I've like
literally just been sitting and watching
CNN all day long and like and then I'm
like oh my God I'm like really unhappy
with myself so like maybe like have some
time set out to where like you're not
interacting with your phone you're just
like out in nature going for walks maybe
go interact with real humans um I think
that actually might help people a lot is
go talk to your neighborhood go talk to
your community go hang out with your
kids you know ultimately yes
presidential elections are a very very
big deal and elections have
consequences but regardless just look
out for your people look out for
yourself go look out for your colleagues
that be there for people and if you
notice people getting in these ruds it's
probably just because they're just
consuming so much media and it's just
not great for our mental health yeah I
will say though I disagree on the CNN
front like I like it like I don't I have
boundaries and I can compartmentalize
and I'll put it on mute sometimes but I
like it I think following kind of what's
going on in the different angles but I
will say like the Tik toks the this the
all the fake I mean that's a whole
different ball game I think of
distraction and chaos and insanity but I
do enjoy this CNN route I do yeah I
don't what's the guy's name John uh the
the guy with the white hair who does the
board I actually like him I like the
board thing yeah yeah and like I said I
I don't John King yeah yeah I think so
but I spend a lot of time doing all
those other things family this I
actually don't spend a lot of time like
my ear like so it's nice for me to have
it up and and look at that but like I
will tell you I've never actually I
don't have a Tik Tok account I I think
that is just yeah chaos I did have one
question for you sure because uh you
have so many strong opinions and you
know whatnot but one thing that's
confusing me in all this that I'm scared
about is like feel like every day I wake
up and there's new voting laws in this
state and Georgia and that like that
seems to be very chaotic to me and I
worry about all of that like a week
before the election all this stuff
changing and confusion just causing a
big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
show this is where I think history is
like a really
good uh barometer
for like what are we experiencing right
now and like how crazy is it now
compared to like what we've had in the
past um specifically for like what
you're talking about which is like um
lawsuits and you know things coming up
as it relates to like voting roles and
stuff like that like that's been going
on for forever um and in fact like I
think there's like a a big sound bite
right now around election integrity and
our elections have gotten so much more
secure as time has gotten on like now I
I I personally think they could be even
more secure um but like none of this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is new and every four years we act
like oh my God we're like entering this
like you know Uncharted Territory and
it's just not true like um you know the
stuff that happened you know in the the
 
like legitimate election rigging then
compared to like what we have now I just
think it's a little bit it's just a
little bit trite to say those things
especially when they lack evidence um
but the thing I want to ask you is like
so now now let's live in a world Kelly
to where like your cheap people off are
in a company you're not right now but
just say you were
hypothetically the results are
announced and half of your company is
pissed and the other half of your
company is
celebrating how do you navigate like
that next week or so as people are like
really still living it and steeped in it
yeah I mean I love I love how we talk
about nothing's really new because I
honestly wouldn't do anything different
than I did eight years ago I really
wouldn't and for me you said you asked
what do I do after the election what
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matters is now it matters what
you do I think leading up to the
election in stud expectations with the
company being clear about your stance
and the boundaries the organization
holds what you expect from from
individuals after the election no matter
if their candidate wins or not um
repeating that over and over because
they don't listen if you say forget yeah
totally I would do it literally a month
before the election and I would repeat
it like four times a week in different
forums um and obviously showing support
um presenting options for people to do
what they need to do and making sure
that leaders are accountable for you
know enabling that and supporting that
um and it's so funny like I you know I
learned a lot uh working for a company
you know headquarted North Carolina
because I grew up I've done nothing me
really the last 25 years but but Bay
Area right largely Democratic companies
and I realize like different companies
have all different mixes of people and
stances and so matter if you're
rightwing or leftwing as far as like the
majority you have to make sure that
you're inclusive and showing support and
acknowledgement for everybody um you
know and especially if you're a CPO and
you have strong
opinions and strong beliefs in one way
or another that might be opposite so
that that's the part where you have to
compartmentalize which can also be hard
totally yeah it's it's it's interesting
you mentioned the word inclusive there
and I think a lot of times like when
we're talking about uh inclusivity it's
like selective inclusivity you know the
stuff that like I want to include that I
feel like is marginalized you know and
this is this is actually I think one of
the hardest parts about being any
executive in today's world is like the
amount of diversity we have inside of
companies especially intellectual
diversity yeah is is bigger than at any
other point in time in history yeah
people believe completely different
things and so you know given that we're
we're in we're on Election Day today and
now we're going to get into results you
know God knows how like how long that
stuff is going to take all I would say
to folks is I totally agree with his
Kelly's advice is like if you've been
you know sitting expectations up until
now awesome like you're ahead of the
game keep doing it um if you haven't
then you know all I would say is is like
people are going to need a little bit of
time to process this thing um and so
giving people like the amount of space
like you know this is I I would say like
the week to where like less productivity
is generally happening but also like
leaning into work is a distraction like
work is a distraction from the wildness
going on in the world it's kind of like
the normal thing and so helping people
realize that like hey like let's just
get back to work like this is going to
help us continue to move forward I
that's typically what I do is I get back
to my routine on these things um but it
is a really weird time in our country
right now and all I can say is like I
really hope that you know you could
still love your colleagues you can love
your neighbors regardless of who they
voted for and I hope we can all get
behind this next president because we
need it we need to win and we got to get
behind the winner
regardless yeah thanks all all right
happy election day all see you HR
