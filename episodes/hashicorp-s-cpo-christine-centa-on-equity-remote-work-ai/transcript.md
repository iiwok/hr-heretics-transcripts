all right everybody welcome back to
another session of HR Heretics it's
great to have you we're so happy to be
here with Christine senta who's the
chief people officer at Hashi Corp I'm a
big fan of Hashi Corp have been for a
while can't wait to get into this prior
to Hashi Corp for the past about five
years she was at pivotal software and
Senior leadership roles and then before
that almost had a 12E stint at EMC which
got picked up by Dell is that right
Christine yeah so thank you so much for
joining us I know you're super slammed
because you and Dave are building like
crazy over at Hashi Corp before we
started recording Christine tried to
apologize to us because sometimes she
apparently swears which if you're an
avid listener you're laughing right now
because it's kind of like our second
language though I was listening and I
heard you all doing that I'm like oh
these are my peeps and then I was like
oh but what if I do it I'll go on the
podcast I was like so like my team like
my team knows and the leadership team
knows but you just added her toing her
my kids definitely know to her employee
base Kelly that like it's okay they're
just like who is this person now like
they know just let kids know their
parents swear they know and I just want
to thank you because I was considering
trying to swear less and now I'm not
going to anymore so let's get into it
Nolan where do we want to start start
I'd actually love to start with you
you're in the seat now after a career
that was almost exclusively in
compensation and I think you've been in
the seat now for about seven eight
months how's that transition been for
you yeah actually it's been relatively
natural to be honest I I was able to
start my career in a rotational program
so I did a lot of different roles within
HR and I did find my niche in comp back
in the later EMC days and truly loved
the analytical components and being able
to drive business decisions based on
data and and and I definitely like the
the compensation element of the rewards
but the the the job I had back at
pivotal software and the Hashi corp job
was definitely broader than just comp
right so over time I I really was able
to kind of build all the other
components right so it's broader into
Total Rewards it got into people
operations it got into Global Mobility
quite frankly they made me do the HR for
HR job we all love that one so I never
really got rid of the business partner
part so it was it was no okay it was a
pretty it was a pretty seamless
transition I think I think that you know
we talk about the importance of having
you know knowing your you know your the
areas that you you know right and you
can be dangerous in like the areas you
grew up with that you really know the
areas you know enough that to be
dangerous and then the elements where
you just haven't played before and I was
very lucky moving into this to see like
the areas that I hadn't really played
before just like in the recruiting Arena
like super strong team so it it really
was it was it worked it worked well for
for this particular job so very lucky
we've been talking a lot about comp on
the show and I think there's a lot going
on there's a lot of data right now from
Carta that shows that the comp has
actually like remained very flat over
the last couple of years in as relates
to a cash standpoint in equity we've
actually seen for Venture back tech
companies It Go down significantly
especially for new higher grants what
are you guys seeing in in compensation
right now and how are you guys thinking
about it given the macroeconomic
environment yeah I think that seeing
pretty pretty similar similar things I
think from a comp perspective you know
things have stayed pretty relatively
flat I mean granted we were still kind
of in our you know in our growth phase
for for a while so you're always kind of
trying to play catchup in that in that
element so we we were able to
continue to bump Folks up and not have
to do anything like where nothing you
know flat or no no increases or anything
like that so that was good you know dip
in kind of what the equity offerings
were were going to be and it was
interesting because we were coming out
of that that period where and I have
done a lot of equity modeling over the
years in a variety of different jobs and
I'm like I'm not trusting that data I
think there's a lag Market data lag
because it was it was rough it was rough
for a lot of companies with their Equity
burn really rough for a coule years I I
lived it as well Christine I mean I
think you know those of us who are in
the series series e may be going to go
public in the next year 18 months it was
just a really tough time to get caught
in you know what I call no man's land
when you're surfing like you got to go
out or all the way in you can't and
that's that's a tough place to get
caught you brought up a a good point
around around the equity and and the the
lag that that's the point that you
brought up that that so many of us have
lived because we live and die by market
data and comp data and this how how have
you done that have you been like a loud
voice like we're not going to do the lag
we're going to balance this is what I'm
hearing and seeing on the street how
have you influenced that given I know a
lot of companies want to go bu the book
when it comes to Market data yeah I
think that I've been a part of I think I
think a lot of us are you know
successful in the roles that we are when
we try to build that you know Network in
the role that we're in right so you try
to like tap your you know you tap your
your colleagues at other companies and
I've been really lucky to kind of get
involved in my comp consortiums and like
a bunch of other folks that I really
trust out in the industry and you know
staying close to cogs other other areas
so we have these conversations all the
time just like you know we're having
these convers I love like this forums
this is the stuff that we we need to be
doing as HR professionals talking about
this stuff all the time I love this
podcast so we uh we were doing a couple
things when I was tapping other other
companies kind of like what are you
seeing I was definitely talking to like
our our comp consultants for sure like
what what are you seeing as you're
trying to hire people you can get a lot
of really great information from your
recruiters I mean I know a lot of times
they're always I know a lot of times
they are saying you know we need more we
need more we need more we need more
that's always the answer but ultimately
like if you poke at it and you're kind
of like you know are you sure the other
thing that we did which I thought was
was was good was you know we had our we
had our ranges and then we started to do
it almost like in a a trial function I
was like you know what here's our range
but you can't go over midpoint
anymore let's spend the next two months
midpoint midpoint and Below tell me how
it goes I love it experimenting testing
yeah we tested it so we tested it for a
couple months mid midpoint to low we
were we were fine and so I kind of laid
out this process so that we could test
it for a period um and we were and we
were fine now granted we were growing we
had a great story um and you know folks
were coming here for the excitement and
the work that they were going to get to
do in the culture so I didn't I did have
that added element that obviously helped
from a value perspective but yeah I mean
I just we just tested it and see how it
went and it worked the recruiters are
such an important point one of my
companies I mean noan your have opin me
on this like I I I I was like I want
everyone to record every so not name no
name you can redact that but I want
every candidate we talk to what's the
street value what are they making Etc
and the the start differences between
those ranges some of them were very wide
those
gaps yeah it's recruiting tends to have
a really good pulse on what's going on
in the market but Christine to your
point we also tend to just be like well
like you know we can just solve all the
problems with comps so just like
increase comp and then these problems go
away and then you have all these issues
with internal equity and so it doesn't
actually really solve any problems it
just solves the getting in the door
problem I think it's you you mentioned a
really good point though that at Hashi
you guys had been growing super fast so
I'm assuming what you told the team was
look there's an upside story here that
needs to be pitched a little bit better
but really pitching the growth of the
equity and how we are essentially an
outlier compared to other companies in
this market is that like a fair
characterization of how you guys thought
about it yeah I mean we we definitely
thought about it in that way but I also
think just from a negotiation
perspective you know for your recruiters
I mean they will leverage like any they
will leverage what they have so if you
tell them you if you you you can close
this candidate faster if you just stay
at midpoint stay at midpoint go ahead go
if you have to go above it make a
compelling case and tell me why so it
also made it hard I just made it a
little harder just made it a little bit
harder yeah a little extra red tape
changes everything yeah yeah that was it
just made it a little bit harder well
it's just a constraint right like yeah
you know you had you had a couple of
constraints and then all of a sudden
it's like oh we can actually like do
these things and then we also discovered
areas where it was like okay this
particular country or this particular
job you know you got to see patterns too
which also which also informed us of
like areas we needed to adjust yeah I
want to get your take on some of these
these new grants that we're seeing so I
I think I know coinbase is doing this
coinbase lift um I think door Dash is
now doing it they're doing one-year
grants for new hires um and then they're
doing annual
refreshes uh a couple of other companies
like Amazon is doing like the backloaded
grant what is your take on you know how
how companies are are now moving away
from the standard fouryear vest 25% Veet
vest every year yeah I think like a lot
of the HR practices or policies you know
we're really starting to get to that
phase where and I've heard you all say
this like a bunch of time like it's not
not just the best P practice and we just
apply it to wherever we go it's really
trying to figure out what is going to
work given the current state phase that
your company is in mature it is how big
it is how many countries public private
I mean it's just there's so many
different factors right it could be a
short-term fix it may not be something
you want to do forever and and then you
then you also kind of Burden yourself
with that okay now we got to we up it
the same amount for all those people
again next year whereas you're if you're
doing the bigger amounts for a longer
period of time right then you can also
get at it where I'm not giving it to
everybody that allowing year I'm only
giving it to half of our population
because a bunch of them already had so
you it has to be a really purposeful
long-term decision play to make sure you
really are thinking through what does
this mean for me next year and not just
solving for for today and and if and if
it's something you can solve for in the
long term or you're prepared for that
fine but if you haven't thought about it
it's just going to create another issue
for you the following year I'd love both
your your thoughts on this and because I
I've been I've been thinking about this
a lot and and in my experience equity
and Equity plans and Etc is something
that's extremely hard to change within a
company you know comp committees and
bore I mean it's very sensitive yet I
feel like it's something that should
change more often and I've thought about
the one-year grants and I really really
like it and I couldn't think about any
other reason why we wouldn't do that
besides what I think you were saying
Christine is the administrative burden
of having to reup and look at it every
year and at something to be on top of am
I missing something like why AR AR we
just doing this it's it's not
necessarily the administrative burden
it's the if you do a one-year Grant
right and then year over year you do
that consistently it just means that
you're on the hook right for more
retention perspective to reup them that
following year right and also if you
have someone and and also there's like a
performance element to it in my mind too
so this year this top top talent top
performer whatever we're going to give
them a really huge Grant it's going to
be for this one-year cycle
okay something happens in their life who
knows maybe they're not quite as maybe
something happens and they're not quite
as performing as well the following year
but now that entire Grant is gone so now
it's a do I give them the same do I give
them a little there's no tail right
there's no that you've lost the so a lot
of times what we what you look at right
is this person compared to their
unvested value and how long is that
unvested value going to last and now you
don't have a tale and we missed the
compounding approach right that
compounded I mean yes that's right you
don't have it two years might be an
interesting solution to that but yeah
the four just seems or three I mean just
even if it's just again a stepped
approach I mean so but going from four
to all of a sudden one and then having
that be your Forever that seems you know
drastic unless it's a one time it's
really interesting because you know the
so I think an isolation one and two
sounds interesting but when you're
competing against companies that are
offering for your grants and the
employee has the opportunity to lock
that Grant in and then see upside with
the company for me you know I actually
think it's like really challenging for
these companies to compete right now
because like hey like you know
valuations are kind of depressed most
companies have taken the medicine if I'm
an employee I'm like Now's the Time like
now's the time for me to like go lock in
and when you have a one-year Grant I'm
not locking in I'm just like riding with
you every year and I'm getting Mark to
Market every year you know which is you
know how many people made their money as
part of this last runup the other thing
I'll mention is that at Carta when I
first joined we had fiveyear
grants and the what I learned about that
Christine you you made a an off-handed
comment about being you know your board
being frustrated or you know just having
to negotiate with them on getting
increases to your pool and with the
five-year Grant the issue that we had
was that the pool size was a lot bigger
every year just because it was over a
five-year period And so all of this
stuff is about Trad us but Christine I
did want to ask you about the um I think
a lot of people don't really talk about
how cumbersome it is to go to your board
and to get an increase to the pool it
sounds like you've experienced that a
little bit so what what is that like for
you and how do you interact with the
board as it relates to equity
compensation yeah so again you know
super obviously super data driven you
know a lot of lot of research goes into
it and just a lot of proactive analysis
and just keep staying on top of it too
so for me like we're we're reporting out
on this all the time like every time I
meet with them like I'm showing
information about where we're trending
where we're going where all the
assumptions that we're building into
where the ranges come from why we're
Market you know what I mean so like when
I first joined right even though I
wasn't in the CPO seat I was you know
leading UP Rewards so i' I've been with
this committee and board for for a while
so it really was in the early onset you
know just building up the credibility
around like why we're building it the
way we're building it and and making
sure it's kind of within that you know
that that that market range that they're
comfortable with so a lot of it I think
we were able to and I remember like some
of the shifts that I made were you know
taking things down so that made it
that's an easier of support to get right
I think though where you get the
challenge is the confirmation
year-over-year when you're going in and
saying hey here's the pool I need for
this year here's where this is going to
here's here's where I'm going to make
adjustments to make sure we can stay
within that window of appropriate burn
and then also remember it to liken it to
again phase what phase are you in and
reminding them to like you know what I
mean because everyone comes at it from
whatever experience that they've had so
it's really important to make sure
you've got all your ducks in a row
related to what is within the realm of
ability to explain it to investors
related to where we are as a company and

accomplish hey everyone we'll be right

medavie head over to metav view. a/
Heretics to talk to one of metav VI's
product experts or get started for free
you'll be UPR running an AI enabled in
minutes I agree with all that my my two
cents on that is for sure the the
biggest thing is often and the more data
and more frequent check-ins transparency
building that trust you know sometimes
folks don't talk about this they don't
even see these people once a year and
it's like an enema you know and so
bringing them in as a part of that
journey and I don't know about you but
the thing that I've got tripped up on a
lot is underestimating the pool needed
for hiring that always seemed to go over
and it's like do you know what I mean I
don't know you know and we got lucky
because we made it up for in you know
attrition and shares going back in Kudos
again to the four-year Grant but that
hiring number you know seemed to always
kind of be over budget yeah I think that
you know you want to be so it's it's
interest that that's interesting because
I I feel like that's in one area that
the the modeling component I always
spent so much time on it for that exact
reason because I always wanted to come
in under whatever I gave them whatever
it was so from like an assumption
perspective it was really this
combination of kind of what are you
assuming for attrition what are you
assuming for hiring right because you've
got your recruiting team making certain
assumptions right which is usually more
hires than you're going to do then
you've got your Finance team making
certain assumptions which is usually
less so I always just tried to come up
what are you doing what do you think and
and to try to come up with the the
balance basically in the middle yeah the
market plays a big Ro I mean this again
it was like four and a half years ago
when everyone was so different today
yeah yeah yeah and we and we also like
have a pretty we had for a while like a
pretty consistent attrition like it was
pretty easy to kind of yeah so there
there was some it was pretty predictable
predictable yeah yeah yeah you guys went
public in 2021 and you had joined I
think in 2020 what has been like the
biggest change between the private
version of Hashi and the public version
of Hashi great question I think it's
like any you know any company that's
kind of scaling and such I mean we were
still relatively small right when we
were when we went public so it was you
know just post going public and we
really were just still hiring it just
like an amazing clip and so when we're
we were thinking about that when when
you what so having gone through the IPO
process before it at pital software like
really laying in a lot of that
scalability like groundwork right like
your compliance and your reporting
getting all the right systems in place
and like doing all that Quant prep and
Equity prep right there was a lot of
things that you know I kind of came in
and like started to like Bank through
like pretty quickly but there was still
a lot more to do like I didn't feel like
I was quite as prepared this time as I
was the last time so there was I I think
the biggest shift was post that period
was really getting the operational rigor
in place related to a lot of processes
we were still kind of going through that
post posto public and it's because we
had grown at such a scale and we were
still we were still growing right it was
just get them in the door get them in
the door get them in the door and now
it's a matter of like okay are we
ramping everybody appropriately does
everyone know what we're doing are all
the managers enabled and you know have
we gotten them the right things to sign
you know that that kind of stuff so I
think we were there was more of a
catch-up mode from like a process
perspective and that was probably the
the biggest difference I saw but I think
though that you know I think some some
would say that you know that that
transition you kind of start to see a
shift almost in culture at at that point
in stage when when people go post public
when they go public but I don't think I
feel like we did a really good job like
trying to stay as close to our
principles and culture as as as we could
and I think that's kind of why we
managed through a lot of the the things
that were kind of going on in the
industry at the time right covid was Co
was hitting right soon as we went public
I think it was like a few you we were we
were there like we were we were we were
we were we were in the midst of of of of
Co so I it was kind of one of those
where we were navigating that time that
the great resonation was happening again
luckily we were in super successful mode
so we didn't really have a lot of folks
exiting but we we were able able to
really maintain a lot of the elements of
our of our principles and culture at
that time with the remote work etc yeah
were you able to maintain the the shape
of your talent and the right talent
because sometimes even if it that those
principles stay and whatnot right just
the stamp of being public in people's
minds so I'm not it's time for me to go
I need to go and that you know we we
absolutely saw that we absolutely saw
that post post going public you
definitely have that contingent that's
like nope I'm the startup team you know
that kind of stuff and absolutely yes we
we absolutely so so Dave likes to talk
about it as as our CEO he talks about it
in Phase shifts right so so that
definitely was a shift related
to where we were and the growth that we
were doing right and you can definitely
see the difference in like whether
that's your sales team or whatever and
kind of that that level of what you want
to do from a company phase perspective
so we did see a shift for sure yeah you
had mentioned you had mentioned being
fully remote we're we're talking today
it's uh September 26th and just last
week Amazon announced that they're going
fully back to the office how do how do
you guys think about this remote versus
in office debate that we're unbelievably
having again yeah it's we have a very
unique history on this so we're dealing
with some different types of challenges
all related to this but it it's a
different we're starting from a
different point right so initially the
company was built as a remote remote
based right a remote based you did have
GNA folks like in an office one office
so it was very much built in a culture
of it was okay to work from home and
people were remote and so very writing
based culture very slack happy culture
very Zoom happy culture like all all
those things so very you know dedicated
moments in time that you met with people
and and worked on stuff very
collaborative Google doc Focus you know
all that kind of stuff so you know
for us when covid hit right
and companies were trying to figure out
how do we go remote like what do we do
we were all kind of like well just do
this like this is not hard this isn't
hard this is how we do it this works
then when you start to hit that critical
mass right and you're in you know 20
countries around the world and all this
kind of stuff like it
becomes more you really have to be super
deliberate and intentional to maintain a
remote work environment so I think what
all these other companies are are
grappling with is they were in office
and so and then they had to go remote
and people you know loved the different
components of what that meant for their
lifestyle and now it's reverting back to
okay we need to make sure we're
productive we need to make sure we're
building relationships and having
community and be a being collaborative
and so bringing people back and then
people having that jarring feet where
we're at the similar phase where we're
thinking through we need collaboration
we need to build community we need to
make sure there are intentional
connection points for people and there
is only so much you can do that you have
to do there's a bunch of stuff online
that we can do and we're working through
those things and we have a bunch of
strategies there but there is an element
of that human interaction where you do
get those that those real insights that
you you truly need to have as a as a
leader as a team leader manager so for
us we're going at it in a couple
different ways so because we don't have
offices to tell everybody so we don't we
can't do that not one physical space
Christine we we have a couple yeah we
have a couple so we have we have one in
San Francisco we have uh one in Austin
we have one in in Indiana and then we
have one in M we have some some places
that we we've built over the years for
very specific intentional teams and
reasons but for the most most you know
it's it's remote and even the folks who
are you know part of those locations
like they're they're home sometimes too
like for me I'm I'm totally in this
office a couple times a week but I work
from home a couple times a week too so
there really is that that hybrid
component so for us it's really building
those online tools and and intentional
connection points and then also enabling
people to do offs sites get in person
time and then also doing some we were
doing a global Meetup global Meetup days
for all of our our where we have
critical mass in a bunch of different
cities where we don't have offices and
folks will purposely all come in on
those particular days like one is one is
actually today so we bunch of people in
the San Francisco office today awesome
so just to shift gears a little bit your
background is incredible Dave mcjannet
is an amazing leader CEO worked with him
at GitHub you have a growing amazing
product and organization great culture I
want to get into like what's not been
great
like what's been what's been hard if not
for you maybe for for you and Dave
together for the like where where do you
struggle Christine how do you deal with
that like let's let's unpack the you
know the not the not so duckies and
hores part of this amazing journey
you've been on yeah to be honest part of
that the last topic we were going on
related to you know how we're figuring
out how to continue to be remote I mean
that definitely has not been easy in any
way shape or form it was kind of a
discovery I think over the last few
years as we've grown it's like people
really love it it's part of our culture
it's so innate here and it's it's so
important to who we are and why people
work here but we're you know but there's
a struggle there is clearly a gap in how
folks are feeling connected and and you
know other companies as I said are
dealing with it in other ways but for us
like we we have to crack this like folks
need to feel engaged they need and they
need to feel like a sense of belonging
and connected so that has been a bit of
a a stark realization and definitely
differing opin just like out in the
industry there's so many differing
opinions here no we got to keep it we
got to maintain it maybe we have to go
to a hub strategy at some point do we
have to do it do we not do it how when
do we do it where do we go like so those
conversations have been real how is that
showing up like how is the the lack of
connectedness showing up I think
sometimes it's come up in a a variety of
ways where you might not
see you'll see a a decision point you
know that's made that's brought to the
executive team or whatever and we're
like okay like that's the decision we
make a decision okay off we go and then
you discover like a really critical team
that's part of implementing that and
making that happen like there's a a
misalignment in kind of some of those
decisions being made right and and it's
just because there hasn't been that
opportunity to talk about it or
collabor and whether that can be solved
with build you know simply solved by
just building relationships you know and
so it's like if there was better cross
functional collaboration across some
teams those things would have come up
and so it's a matter of how do you get
those cross functional relationships
built again if you're you know really
truly remote how do you you have to
force that you have to be really
intentional like oh I joined the company
this is my job I'm VP of whatever to be
successful in my job I need to know who
these people are and I've got to go out
and find them I got to find them online
I got to find them in workday I got to
type them in I got to find them on slack
make sure that I meet them because I'm
not going to see them at a meeting or a
leap I'm not going to right you have to
like really be super intentional and
those and that's definitely something
that's been that's been a struggle which
is why we're leaning in so heavily on it
now let's see what else so other things
that haven't been Rosy any sticking
points between you and Dave anything
that's
particularly spicy as far as philosophy
or approach
or yeah I think so Dave is um so so much
respect for him learned so so much from
this man he is kind of known internally
here is like a combination of like the
professor and an accountant so it's like
you were so it's just that sounds right
so it's just like so he thinks a lot in
you know Frameworks and systems and
results and inputs and outputs and that
kind of thing so I think just sometimes
it's that you know and as we're you know
we're we're talking about you know
building community and connection and
relationship and you know what you know
wanting to you know come up costes like
relatable and personable like that kind
of stuff so I think that's probably been
some of the stuff where he and I have
been like I'm like you know something is
simple as X would go a long way you know
I know you don't want to consider
another holiday but this one we really
need to add like I get it you want
people executing and working but I
promise adding this holiday is not g to
make it difference in your productivity
numbers so I think it's been kind of
some of that stuff I love that I mean so
I I talk I coach a lot of folks and I'm
always like listen be a little selfish
like you got to be a little you know you
got to win hearts and minds of the
company Etc but if you're doing
something really well like blow it out
and talk about it and get some credit
for it right I don't think that we do
that enough because we that's just not
natural for us to think like that
initially but we did an episode I don't
know months ago and on how to kind of
make sure you're showcasing and talking
about things and and holding up on a
pedestal of things that you're kicking
ass at particularly if it's the stuff
that people are poking holes in like I
don't feel like like I don't feel like
I'm paid fairly it's like all right well
let me talk to you about how we do this
here and what like I you know and and
and how we're because the assumption is
if you're not talking about the fact of
how you do stuff they're assuming you're
either don't know what you're doing
you're making it up I mean who knows
what they're assuming right
so I just feel like there's so such a
good way to talk about some of this
stuff that we think has been taboo for
for so long and it's just like this just
tell them you're doing it right tell
them and if you're doing it wrong I've
gone up and said listen people we
haven't figured this out we're kind of
we're kind of falling over here like
hold my hand like just trust like we
will update you every two weeks and that
stops the narratives too it does we
started our when I started here we did I
I pushed for like you know what I'm
doing a wage Gap study and when I get
the results I'm telling people and I was
like we're going to do what and so and
it wasn't it was not perfect it was not
and we talked about it and I said it's
not perfect and so and we just released
our our last one and we're we're we're
there we're so close so great so we
talked about it but that was definitely
one of those like what are we gonna do
yeah it's always amazed me how how
empathetic employees can actually be
towards us if you communicate I think
that's like what both of you are getting
at which is and Christine you had said
it before which is when you don't
communicate people fill in gaps with the
worst version of the story that's right
it's a common human trait and at scale
inside of a company I've experienced it
in it's so painful when it happens
because like the The Narrative and the
sound bite gets so far down the tracks
you you can't like put the horse back in
the barn like once it's gone it's like
so gone and trying to get people to like
understand what's actually going on if
you've lost control of the narrative I
think is actually like one of the
hardest parts about the job that nobody
talks about that's right and there's
been times where it's like we don't know
the answer right and so or there's no
new update on something they're they're
waiting
for I'm still telling them that like I'm
still getting out in front and saying I
know this is a Hot Topic I don't know
and I still don't know you know I think
that's and so we're we we've been doing
a lot better at that over the last year
or two like we have to just tell them
you don't know lean into it you got yeah
you got to lean into it what you just
described there we have a term for it
current we call it the no update update
yeah that's right it's just like even
when you don't have an update you need
to update people about that because
otherwise they're going to wonder and
when they wonder they fill in those gaps
with bad versions of the story they
assume you do know and you're just not
telling them yeah that's so true yes %
so true all right I want let's talk
about AI so AI is like coming you know
it seems like every single day now I'm
seeing new tools and I'm hearing about
new tools and so how are you guys
thinking about the AI strategy for the
people team yes so I'm this is kind of
one of those areas where I've been
thinking about it and talking about it
for a few years and we're I feel like
we're just so behind where I would want
to be to be you know fully transparent
cuz I'm super excited about this and we
just have been doing so much catchup for
other operational things that we just
haven't been able to lean in on it as
some of the other other big companies
have but I think I don't know if you're
as behind as you think Christine I was
maybe not at a conference this week and
there was session on AI and everyone's
kind of looking at each other like I
think everyone thinks everyone else is
doing all these things so I just wanted
to throw that up yeah so we we we put
stuff in place like we've thought
through things like so for example exle
it would be great if we could get to a
point where we could leverage AI for
employee inquiries like oh my gosh we
should be able to do that how great is
that then you start to like peel back
the onion and you're like okay so in
order to do that in order for that to
even make sense that means all of our
information for what employees common
questions are need to be really easily
searchable in one way in one form in one
thing so that means we're going to have
to put it all on this particular website
but we all have to put it in this format
so it's easily found to know you can't
just link out to something because then
if we're trying to search for it it
can't link out to that it's got to be
linked out to and then it became this
like oh my gosh the amount of work to
prepare for the AI was just exorbitant
and then that became you know really
difficult for like the day the
day-to-day but I do think like that is a
huge area where that would would be
exciting if you if you actually have the
time that from the ground up to really
think about here's all my people team
content how do I put it in a way that I
really could leverage a tool system I
think that where we have started to
scratch the surface is definitely on the
recruiting front which I think is a lot
is like kind of the the Gateway I think
for a lot of the a lot of uh HR teams
and related to you know how do you work
through identifying you know candidates
and and finding the right skill set
please say more I'm I'm actually like
really interested in this because I
agree with you I'm seeing it a lot in
recruiting recruiting feels like the the
frontier for most people teams but how
are you guys deploying it and what are
the problems you're solving yeah we
haven't we're still early early onset
just coming just coming but it really is
a matter of like how do you Source
through how you Source through
candidates right how do you Source
through and do you know top level
searches for onliners or skills and such
and then how do you assess like certain
elements of how folks code how do you
assess like certain elements of that as
part of the initial front but it's super
early and it's it's really in kind of
research mode you know kind of like how
we're trying to deploy it yeah I'm
curious I've been talking other leaders
about this and one of the the things
that's been coming up in the last like
 
recruiting is the the top of the funnel
and for companies around your stage what
I'm starting to hear is like we think
that this is the future is this
basically like the essentially replacing
the recruiter screen with some version
of AI is that do you think like you're
like yes like I want that or how like
are you thinking like uh like we can
deploy it in more subtle ways I think
that regarding AI whatever winds up
happening it has to we have one of my
favorite principles is beauty works
better one of our nine principles too
many but anyway and it's this concept of
like you want to obviously come up with
the solve you want to find the best
solution but you really can't do it too
quickly you really have to figure out
the best way to apply so I think there
could be a
future and it's likely where we're going
to be honest where that can there might
be that initial phase of funnel that
might be purely AI based right but it
can't be a you know and I think that
that would work but you can't you can't
set it and forget it right it has to be
like a methodology of what are you doing
and how are you sourcing and making sure
that there's an audit capability to make
sure that I feel like you would have to
in some sort I just wouldn't want to set
it and just say good to go there'd be so
many things that could go wrong with
that right you really have to to test it
like would you do it and then have a
sample of a certain amount of you know a
person I want you to go through the ones
that were rejected go through 50 make
sure there wasn't any that we went
through that was clearly something that
you would have considered based on the
story that's in the resume and not the
words we missed you know what I mean
like I feel like there could be a way
that you could do it but I I I do fear
there are pieces that you could Miss
particularly if you just let it go on
its own I do think though that there
might be a future where it works when
candidates are at that point where they
know that's exactly how it's going to
read and they've all adapted their
resume to the way it would need to go
you know what I mean so I feel like what
an interesting take totally I mean
they're going to do it too they're
already using it to create their resume
so why What's the diff you know what's
important to this company let me look up
their principles let me look up their
strategy let me look up the stuff that
that's important AI please create a
resume that has these words yeah you're
you're totally right though about the
candid like that I had not thought about
it that way but you're 100% spot on that
we're not far off from candidates
expecting it to be part of the
experience especially at the top of the
funnel because that's like the most
reasonable place to deploy it just to to
um make you feel potentially a little
bit better about the stuff that you can
miss with AI you know we're having this
discussion right now with autonomous
vehicles and already we know autonomous
vehicles are safer than humans but like
if an autonomous vehicle kills a human
everyone's going to be like it's one
person too many but we deal with like
 
crazy how high deaths are with and so
it's kind of similar because like if we
all are intellectually honest about the
top of the funnel when you get a resume
today for 99.8% of ATS it just goes in
chronological order we don't look at all
of them the buckets absolute disaster
and so like any sort of improvement here
is going to actually be better than most
experiences yeah yeah I agree I agree
that's super interesting and and I think
for me just my my big my one of my big
takeaways Christine you said is that I
don't think a lot of teams have crossed
this bridge yet because we're all
talking about wouldn't it be great if
and when we can do this and this with AI
the work to get
there that's a whole another [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ball game I think that was the
first first F bomb any of us had said by
the way on this episode but yeah Kelly
Kelly kep it's but it you know it's it
is one of those situations though to
where like I I think right now Christine
you're in the same situation as everyone
else which is like nobody's really
deployed it in a meaningful way but we
we are now starting to like tangibly
feel and believe in like the next
Frontier of it and this is like a
perfect example I think the knowledge
base is like another one of those
perfect examples like we can all see and
feel that your your PO on the knowledge
base was interesting though because I I
think you know we get caught up in like
oh my God what is the end State and how
are people going to use this when we
forget about like how much work is it
going to take to deploy this thing and
is that is that cost benefit worth it
and I think right now you're you're
actually figuring out exactly what my
friends are figuring out just like H
we'll just kind of wait until this next
version of it gets better and it's
easier for to deploy and I don't think
that a lot of folks are aware of the
work to to make this perfect Utopia like
easy it's it's a whole so I find it
interesting too like when I'm talking to
some of like folks on my team or like
we're having like career conversations
of what I want to do next whatever and
like for particularly folks like in the
people operations Arena like what do you
want to do I'm like you know what I
don't I want to make sure you're not
afraid of this lean in learn it's coming
and I think this is going to be like a
huge Niche for people from a skills
perspective on how do you leverage Ai
and leverage it well and like there's so
many like I mean like this is I think
this could be a really cool yeah some
companies are already anointing roles or
Andor people to focus on figuring this
out which makes total sense it does
absolutely absolutely Christine this has
been a blast we're so grateful for you
taking the time you guys are absolutely
killing it right now at Hashi and we
wish you nothing but success moving in
the future thank you so much this was
super fun and just an honor to be able
