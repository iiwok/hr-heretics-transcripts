like you know we can just solve all the
problems with comps so just like
 
problems with comps so just like

equity and how we are essentially an
 
equity and how we are essentially an
outlier compared to other companies in
 
outlier compared to other companies in

this like a bunch of time like it's not
not just the best P practice and we just
 
not just the best P practice and we just
apply it to wherever we go it's really
 
apply it to wherever we go it's really
trying to figure out what is going to
 
trying to figure out what is going to
work given the current state phase that
 
work given the current state phase that
your company is in mature it is how big
 
your company is in mature it is how big
it is how many countries public private
 
it is how many countries public private
I mean it's just there's so many
 
I mean it's just there's so many
different factors right it could be a
 
different factors right it could be a
short-term fix it may not be something
 
short-term fix it may not be something
you want to do forever and and then you
 
you want to do forever and and then you
then you also kind of Burden yourself
 
then you also kind of Burden yourself
with that okay now we got to we up it
 
with that okay now we got to we up it
the same amount for all those people
 
the same amount for all those people
again next year whereas you're if you're
 
again next year whereas you're if you're
doing the bigger amounts for a longer
 
doing the bigger amounts for a longer
period of time right then you can also
 
period of time right then you can also
get at it where I'm not giving it to
 
get at it where I'm not giving it to
everybody that allowing year I'm only
 
everybody that allowing year I'm only
giving it to half of our population
 
giving it to half of our population
because a bunch of them already had so
 
because a bunch of them already had so
you it has to be a really purposeful
 
you it has to be a really purposeful
long-term decision play to make sure you
 
long-term decision play to make sure you
really are thinking through what does
 
really are thinking through what does
this mean for me next year and not just
 
this mean for me next year and not just
solving for for today and and if and if
 
solving for for today and and if and if
it's something you can solve for in the
 
it's something you can solve for in the
long term or you're prepared for that
 
long term or you're prepared for that
fine but if you haven't thought about it
 
fine but if you haven't thought about it
it's just going to create another issue
 
it's just going to create another issue
for you the following year I'd love both
 
for you the following year I'd love both
your your thoughts on this and because I
 
your your thoughts on this and because I
I've been I've been thinking about this
 
I've been I've been thinking about this
a lot and and in my experience equity
 
a lot and and in my experience equity
and Equity plans and Etc is something
 
and Equity plans and Etc is something
that's extremely hard to change within a
 
that's extremely hard to change within a
company you know comp committees and
 
company you know comp committees and
bore I mean it's very sensitive yet I
 
bore I mean it's very sensitive yet I
feel like it's something that should
 
feel like it's something that should
change more often and I've thought about
 
change more often and I've thought about
the one-year grants and I really really
 
the one-year grants and I really really
like it and I couldn't think about any
 
like it and I couldn't think about any
other reason why we wouldn't do that
 
other reason why we wouldn't do that
besides what I think you were saying
 
besides what I think you were saying
Christine is the administrative burden
 
Christine is the administrative burden
of having to reup and look at it every
 
of having to reup and look at it every
year and at something to be on top of am
 
year and at something to be on top of am
I missing something like why AR AR we
 
I missing something like why AR AR we
just doing this it's it's not
 
just doing this it's it's not
necessarily the administrative burden
 
necessarily the administrative burden
it's the if you do a one-year Grant
 
it's the if you do a one-year Grant
right and then year over year you do
 
right and then year over year you do
that consistently it just means that
 
that consistently it just means that
you're on the hook right for more
 
you're on the hook right for more
retention perspective to reup them that
 
retention perspective to reup them that
following year right and also if you
 
following year right and also if you
have someone and and also there's like a
 
have someone and and also there's like a
performance element to it in my mind too
 
performance element to it in my mind too
so this year this top top talent top
 
so this year this top top talent top
performer whatever we're going to give
 
performer whatever we're going to give
them a really huge Grant it's going to
 
them a really huge Grant it's going to
be for this one-year cycle
 
be for this one-year cycle
okay something happens in their life who
 
okay something happens in their life who
knows maybe they're not quite as maybe
 
knows maybe they're not quite as maybe
something happens and they're not quite
 
something happens and they're not quite
as performing as well the following year
 
as performing as well the following year
but now that entire Grant is gone so now
 
but now that entire Grant is gone so now
it's a do I give them the same do I give
 
it's a do I give them the same do I give
them a little there's no tail right
 
them a little there's no tail right
there's no that you've lost the so a lot
 
there's no that you've lost the so a lot
of times what we what you look at right
 
of times what we what you look at right
is this person compared to their
 
is this person compared to their
unvested value and how long is that
 
unvested value and how long is that
unvested value going to last and now you
 
unvested value going to last and now you
don't have a tale and we missed the
 
don't have a tale and we missed the
compounding approach right that
 
compounding approach right that
compounded I mean yes that's right you
 
compounded I mean yes that's right you
don't have it two years might be an
 
don't have it two years might be an
interesting solution to that but yeah
 
interesting solution to that but yeah
the four just seems or three I mean just
 
the four just seems or three I mean just
even if it's just again a stepped
 
even if it's just again a stepped
approach I mean so but going from four
 
approach I mean so but going from four
to all of a sudden one and then having
 
to all of a sudden one and then having
that be your Forever that seems you know
 
that be your Forever that seems you know
drastic unless it's a one time it's
 
drastic unless it's a one time it's
really interesting because you know the

offering for your grants and the
 
offering for your grants and the
employee has the opportunity to lock
 
employee has the opportunity to lock
that Grant in and then see upside with
 
that Grant in and then see upside with
the company for me you know I actually
 
the company for me you know I actually
think it's like really challenging for
 
think it's like really challenging for
these companies to compete right now
 
these companies to compete right now
because like hey like you know
 
because like hey like you know
valuations are kind of depressed most

companies have taken the medicine if I'm
 
companies have taken the medicine if I'm
an employee I'm like Now's the Time like
 
an employee I'm like Now's the Time like
now's the time for me to like go lock in
 
now's the time for me to like go lock in

five-year Grant the issue that we had
was that the pool size was a lot bigger
 
was that the pool size was a lot bigger
every year just because it was over a
 
every year just because it was over a
five-year period And so all of this

kind of scaling and such I mean we were
still relatively small right when we

think we were there was more of a
catch-up mode from like a process
 
catch-up mode from like a process
perspective and that was probably the
 
perspective and that was probably the
the biggest difference I saw but I think
 
the biggest difference I saw but I think
though that you know I think some some
 
though that you know I think some some
would say that you know that that
 
would say that you know that that
transition you kind of start to see a
 
transition you kind of start to see a
shift almost in culture at at that point
 
shift almost in culture at at that point
in stage when when people go post public
 
in stage when when people go post public
when they go public but I don't think I
 
when they go public but I don't think I

trying to stay as close to our
 
trying to stay as close to our
principles and culture as as as we could
 
principles and culture as as as we could

hores part of this amazing journey
 
hores part of this amazing journey
you've been on yeah to be honest part of
 
you've been on yeah to be honest part of
that the last topic we were going on
 
that the last topic we were going on
related to you know how we're figuring
 
related to you know how we're figuring
out how to continue to be remote I mean
 
out how to continue to be remote I mean
that definitely has not been easy in any
 
that definitely has not been easy in any
way shape or form it was kind of a
 
way shape or form it was kind of a
discovery I think over the last few
 
discovery I think over the last few
years as we've grown it's like people
 
years as we've grown it's like people
really love it it's part of our culture
 
really love it it's part of our culture
it's so innate here and it's it's so
 
it's so innate here and it's it's so
important to who we are and why people
 
important to who we are and why people
work here but we're you know but there's
 
work here but we're you know but there's
a struggle there is clearly a gap in how
 
a struggle there is clearly a gap in how
folks are feeling connected and and you
 
folks are feeling connected and and you
know other companies as I said are
 
know other companies as I said are
dealing with it in other ways but for us
 
dealing with it in other ways but for us
like we we have to crack this like folks
 
like we we have to crack this like folks
need to feel engaged they need and they
 
need to feel engaged they need and they
need to feel like a sense of belonging
 
need to feel like a sense of belonging
and connected so that has been a bit of
 
and connected so that has been a bit of
a a stark realization and definitely
 
a a stark realization and definitely
differing opin just like out in the
 
differing opin just like out in the
industry there's so many differing
 
industry there's so many differing
opinions here no we got to keep it we
 
opinions here no we got to keep it we
got to maintain it maybe we have to go
 
got to maintain it maybe we have to go
to a hub strategy at some point do we
 
to a hub strategy at some point do we
have to do it do we not do it how when
 
have to do it do we not do it how when
do we do it where do we go like so those
 
do we do it where do we go like so those
conversations have been real how is that
 
conversations have been real how is that
showing up like how is the the lack of
 
showing up like how is the the lack of
connectedness showing up I think
 
connectedness showing up I think
sometimes it's come up in a a variety of
 
sometimes it's come up in a a variety of
ways where you might not
 
ways where you might not
see you'll see a a decision point you
 
see you'll see a a decision point you
know that's made that's brought to the
 
know that's made that's brought to the
executive team or whatever and we're
 
executive team or whatever and we're
like okay like that's the decision we
 
like okay like that's the decision we
make a decision okay off we go and then
 
make a decision okay off we go and then
you discover like a really critical team
 
you discover like a really critical team
that's part of implementing that and
 
that's part of implementing that and
making that happen like there's a a
 
making that happen like there's a a
misalignment in kind of some of those
 
misalignment in kind of some of those
decisions being made right and and it's
 
decisions being made right and and it's
just because there hasn't been that
 
just because there hasn't been that
opportunity to talk about it or
 
opportunity to talk about it or
collabor and whether that can be solved
 
collabor and whether that can be solved
with build you know simply solved by
 
with build you know simply solved by
just building relationships you know and
 
just building relationships you know and
so it's like if there was better cross
 
so it's like if there was better cross
functional collaboration across some
 
functional collaboration across some
teams those things would have come up
 
teams those things would have come up
and so it's a matter of how do you get
 
and so it's a matter of how do you get
those cross functional relationships
 
those cross functional relationships
built again if you're you know really
 
built again if you're you know really
truly remote how do you you have to
 
truly remote how do you you have to
force that you have to be really
 
force that you have to be really
intentional like oh I joined the company
 
intentional like oh I joined the company
this is my job I'm VP of whatever to be
 
this is my job I'm VP of whatever to be
successful in my job I need to know who
 
successful in my job I need to know who
these people are and I've got to go out
 
these people are and I've got to go out
and find them I got to find them online
 
and find them I got to find them online
I got to find them in workday I got to
 
I got to find them in workday I got to
type them in I got to find them on slack
 
type them in I got to find them on slack
make sure that I meet them because I'm
 
make sure that I meet them because I'm
not going to see them at a meeting or a
 
not going to see them at a meeting or a
leap I'm not going to right you have to
 
leap I'm not going to right you have to
like really be super intentional and
 
like really be super intentional and
those and that's definitely something
 
those and that's definitely something
that's been that's been a struggle which
 
that's been that's been a struggle which
is why we're leaning in so heavily on it
 
is why we're leaning in so heavily on it
now let's see what else so other things
 
now let's see what else so other things

you know Frameworks and systems and
 
you know Frameworks and systems and
results and inputs and outputs and that

company Etc but if you're doing
something really well like blow it out
 
something really well like blow it out
and talk about it and get some credit
 
and talk about it and get some credit
for it right I don't think that we do
 
for it right I don't think that we do
that enough because we that's just not
 
that enough because we that's just not
natural for us to think like that
 
natural for us to think like that
initially but we did an episode I don't
 
initially but we did an episode I don't
know months ago and on how to kind of
 
know months ago and on how to kind of
make sure you're showcasing and talking
 
make sure you're showcasing and talking
about things and and holding up on a
 
about things and and holding up on a
pedestal of things that you're kicking
 
pedestal of things that you're kicking
ass at particularly if it's the stuff
 
ass at particularly if it's the stuff
that people are poking holes in like I
 
that people are poking holes in like I
don't feel like like I don't feel like
 
don't feel like like I don't feel like
I'm paid fairly it's like all right well
 
I'm paid fairly it's like all right well
let me talk to you about how we do this
 
let me talk to you about how we do this
here and what like I you know and and
 
here and what like I you know and and
and how we're because the assumption is
 
and how we're because the assumption is
if you're not talking about the fact of
 
if you're not talking about the fact of
how you do stuff they're assuming you're
 
how you do stuff they're assuming you're
either don't know what you're doing
 
either don't know what you're doing
you're making it up I mean who knows
 
you're making it up I mean who knows
what they're assuming right
 
what they're assuming right
so I just feel like there's so such a
 
so I just feel like there's so such a
good way to talk about some of this
 
good way to talk about some of this
stuff that we think has been taboo for
 
stuff that we think has been taboo for
for so long and it's just like this just
 
for so long and it's just like this just
tell them you're doing it right tell
 
tell them you're doing it right tell
them and if you're doing it wrong I've
 
them and if you're doing it wrong I've
gone up and said listen people we
 
gone up and said listen people we
haven't figured this out we're kind of
 
haven't figured this out we're kind of
we're kind of falling over here like
 
we're kind of falling over here like
hold my hand like just trust like we
 
hold my hand like just trust like we
will update you every two weeks and that
 
will update you every two weeks and that
stops the narratives too it does we
 
stops the narratives too it does we
started our when I started here we did I
 
started our when I started here we did I
I pushed for like you know what I'm
 
I pushed for like you know what I'm
doing a wage Gap study and when I get
 
doing a wage Gap study and when I get
the results I'm telling people and I was
 
the results I'm telling people and I was
like we're going to do what and so and
 
like we're going to do what and so and
it wasn't it was not perfect it was not
 
it wasn't it was not perfect it was not
and we talked about it and I said it's
 
and we talked about it and I said it's
not perfect and so and we just released
 
not perfect and so and we just released
our our last one and we're we're we're
 
our our last one and we're we're we're
there we're so close so great so we
 
there we're so close so great so we
talked about it but that was definitely
 
talked about it but that was definitely
one of those like what are we gonna do
 
one of those like what are we gonna do
yeah it's always amazed me how how
 
yeah it's always amazed me how how
empathetic employees can actually be
 
empathetic employees can actually be
towards us if you communicate I think
 
towards us if you communicate I think
that's like what both of you are getting
 
that's like what both of you are getting
at which is and Christine you had said
 
at which is and Christine you had said
it before which is when you don't
 
it before which is when you don't
communicate people fill in gaps with the
 
communicate people fill in gaps with the
worst version of the story that's right
 
worst version of the story that's right
it's a common human trait and at scale
 
it's a common human trait and at scale
inside of a company I've experienced it
 
inside of a company I've experienced it
in it's so painful when it happens
 
in it's so painful when it happens
because like the The Narrative and the
 
because like the The Narrative and the
sound bite gets so far down the tracks
 
sound bite gets so far down the tracks
you you can't like put the horse back in
 
you you can't like put the horse back in
the barn like once it's gone it's like
 
the barn like once it's gone it's like
so gone and trying to get people to like
 
so gone and trying to get people to like
understand what's actually going on if
 
understand what's actually going on if
you've lost control of the narrative I
 
you've lost control of the narrative I
think is actually like one of the
 
think is actually like one of the
hardest parts about the job that nobody
 
hardest parts about the job that nobody
talks about that's right and there's
 
talks about that's right and there's
been times where it's like we don't know
 
been times where it's like we don't know
the answer right and so or there's no
 
the answer right and so or there's no
new update on something they're they're
 
new update on something they're they're
waiting
 
waiting
for I'm still telling them that like I'm
 
for I'm still telling them that like I'm
still getting out in front and saying I
 
still getting out in front and saying I
know this is a Hot Topic I don't know
 
know this is a Hot Topic I don't know
and I still don't know you know I think
 
and I still don't know you know I think
that's and so we're we we've been doing
 
that's and so we're we we've been doing
a lot better at that over the last year
 
a lot better at that over the last year
or two like we have to just tell them
 
or two like we have to just tell them
you don't know lean into it you got yeah
 
you don't know lean into it you got yeah
you got to lean into it what you just
 
you got to lean into it what you just
described there we have a term for it
 
described there we have a term for it
current we call it the no update update
 
current we call it the no update update
yeah that's right it's just like even
 
yeah that's right it's just like even
when you don't have an update you need
 
when you don't have an update you need
to update people about that because
 
to update people about that because
otherwise they're going to wonder and
 
otherwise they're going to wonder and
when they wonder they fill in those gaps
 
when they wonder they fill in those gaps
with bad versions of the story they
 
with bad versions of the story they
assume you do know and you're just not
 
assume you do know and you're just not
telling them yeah that's so true yes %
 
telling them yeah that's so true yes %
so true all right I want let's talk
 
so true all right I want let's talk
about AI so AI is like coming you know
 
about AI so AI is like coming you know
it seems like every single day now I'm
 
it seems like every single day now I'm
seeing new tools and I'm hearing about
 
seeing new tools and I'm hearing about
new tools and so how are you guys
 
new tools and so how are you guys
thinking about the AI strategy for the
 
thinking about the AI strategy for the
people team yes so I'm this is kind of
 
people team yes so I'm this is kind of
one of those areas where I've been
 
one of those areas where I've been
thinking about it and talking about it
 
thinking about it and talking about it
for a few years and we're I feel like
 
for a few years and we're I feel like
we're just so behind where I would want
 
we're just so behind where I would want
to be to be you know fully transparent
 
to be to be you know fully transparent
cuz I'm super excited about this and we
 
cuz I'm super excited about this and we
just have been doing so much catchup for
 
just have been doing so much catchup for
other operational things that we just
 
other operational things that we just
haven't been able to lean in on it as
 
haven't been able to lean in on it as
some of the other other big companies
 
some of the other other big companies
have but I think I don't know if you're
 
have but I think I don't know if you're
as behind as you think Christine I was
 
as behind as you think Christine I was
maybe not at a conference this week and
 
maybe not at a conference this week and
there was session on AI and everyone's
 
there was session on AI and everyone's
kind of looking at each other like I
 
kind of looking at each other like I
think everyone thinks everyone else is
 
think everyone thinks everyone else is
doing all these things so I just wanted
 
doing all these things so I just wanted
to throw that up yeah so we we we put
 
to throw that up yeah so we we we put
stuff in place like we've thought
 
stuff in place like we've thought
through things like so for example exle
 
through things like so for example exle
it would be great if we could get to a
 
it would be great if we could get to a
point where we could leverage AI for
 
point where we could leverage AI for
employee inquiries like oh my gosh we
 
employee inquiries like oh my gosh we
should be able to do that how great is
 
should be able to do that how great is
that then you start to like peel back
 
that then you start to like peel back
the onion and you're like okay so in
 
the onion and you're like okay so in
order to do that in order for that to
 
order to do that in order for that to
even make sense that means all of our
 
even make sense that means all of our
information for what employees common
 
information for what employees common
questions are need to be really easily
 
questions are need to be really easily
searchable in one way in one form in one
 
searchable in one way in one form in one
thing so that means we're going to have
 
thing so that means we're going to have
to put it all on this particular website
 
to put it all on this particular website
but we all have to put it in this format
 
but we all have to put it in this format
so it's easily found to know you can't
 
so it's easily found to know you can't
just link out to something because then
 
just link out to something because then
if we're trying to search for it it
 
if we're trying to search for it it
can't link out to that it's got to be
 
can't link out to that it's got to be
linked out to and then it became this
 
linked out to and then it became this
like oh my gosh the amount of work to
 
like oh my gosh the amount of work to
prepare for the AI was just exorbitant
 
prepare for the AI was just exorbitant
and then that became you know really
 
and then that became you know really
difficult for like the day the
 
difficult for like the day the
day-to-day but I do think like that is a
 
day-to-day but I do think like that is a
huge area where that would would be
 
huge area where that would would be
exciting if you if you actually have the
 
exciting if you if you actually have the
time that from the ground up to really
 
time that from the ground up to really
think about here's all my people team
 
think about here's all my people team
content how do I put it in a way that I
 
content how do I put it in a way that I
really could leverage a tool system I
 
really could leverage a tool system I
think that where we have started to
 
think that where we have started to
scratch the surface is definitely on the
 
scratch the surface is definitely on the
recruiting front which I think is a lot
 
recruiting front which I think is a lot
is like kind of the the Gateway I think
 
is like kind of the the Gateway I think
for a lot of the a lot of uh HR teams
 
for a lot of the a lot of uh HR teams
and related to you know how do you work
 
and related to you know how do you work
through identifying you know candidates
 
through identifying you know candidates
and and finding the right skill set
 
and and finding the right skill set
please say more I'm I'm actually like
 
please say more I'm I'm actually like
really interested in this because I
 
really interested in this because I
agree with you I'm seeing it a lot in
 
agree with you I'm seeing it a lot in
recruiting recruiting feels like the the
 
recruiting recruiting feels like the the
frontier for most people teams but how
 
frontier for most people teams but how
are you guys deploying it and what are
 
are you guys deploying it and what are
the problems you're solving yeah we
 
the problems you're solving yeah we
haven't we're still early early onset
 
haven't we're still early early onset
just coming just coming but it really is
 
just coming just coming but it really is
a matter of like how do you Source
 
a matter of like how do you Source
through how you Source through
 
through how you Source through
candidates right how do you Source
 
candidates right how do you Source
through and do you know top level
 
through and do you know top level
searches for onliners or skills and such
 
searches for onliners or skills and such
and then how do you assess like certain
 
and then how do you assess like certain
elements of how folks code how do you
 
elements of how folks code how do you
assess like certain elements of that as
 
assess like certain elements of that as
part of the initial front but it's super
 
part of the initial front but it's super
early and it's it's really in kind of
 
early and it's it's really in kind of
research mode you know kind of like how
 
research mode you know kind of like how
we're trying to deploy it yeah I'm
 
we're trying to deploy it yeah I'm
curious I've been talking other leaders
 
curious I've been talking other leaders
about this and one of the the things
 
about this and one of the the things
that's been coming up in the last like
 
that's been coming up in the last like
 
recruiting is the the top of the funnel
 
recruiting is the the top of the funnel
and for companies around your stage what
 
and for companies around your stage what
I'm starting to hear is like we think
 
I'm starting to hear is like we think
that this is the future is this
 
that this is the future is this
basically like the essentially replacing
 
basically like the essentially replacing
the recruiter screen with some version
 
the recruiter screen with some version
of AI is that do you think like you're
 
of AI is that do you think like you're
like yes like I want that or how like
 
like yes like I want that or how like
are you thinking like uh like we can
 
are you thinking like uh like we can
deploy it in more subtle ways I think
 
deploy it in more subtle ways I think
that regarding AI whatever winds up
 
that regarding AI whatever winds up
happening it has to we have one of my
 
happening it has to we have one of my
favorite principles is beauty works
 
favorite principles is beauty works
better one of our nine principles too
 
better one of our nine principles too
many but anyway and it's this concept of
 
many but anyway and it's this concept of
like you want to obviously come up with
 
like you want to obviously come up with
the solve you want to find the best
 
the solve you want to find the best
solution but you really can't do it too
 
solution but you really can't do it too
quickly you really have to figure out
 
quickly you really have to figure out
the best way to apply so I think there
 
the best way to apply so I think there
could be a
 
could be a
future and it's likely where we're going
 
future and it's likely where we're going
to be honest where that can there might
 
to be honest where that can there might
be that initial phase of funnel that
 
be that initial phase of funnel that
might be purely AI based right but it
 
might be purely AI based right but it
can't be a you know and I think that
 
can't be a you know and I think that
that would work but you can't you can't
 
that would work but you can't you can't
set it and forget it right it has to be
 
set it and forget it right it has to be
like a methodology of what are you doing
 
like a methodology of what are you doing
and how are you sourcing and making sure
 
and how are you sourcing and making sure
that there's an audit capability to make
 
that there's an audit capability to make
sure that I feel like you would have to
 
sure that I feel like you would have to
in some sort I just wouldn't want to set
 
in some sort I just wouldn't want to set
it and just say good to go there'd be so
 
it and just say good to go there'd be so
many things that could go wrong with
