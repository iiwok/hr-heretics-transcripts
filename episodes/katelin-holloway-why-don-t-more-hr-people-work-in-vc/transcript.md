# Katelin Holloway: Why Don’t More HR People Work in VC?

## Transcript

 
that is how we're going to get more
checkbooks not not back room gigs for
people who have deep deep HR experience
this is how we're going to get the
checkbook in those hands and that is my
goal I really desperately think that our
world would be a better place if we had
more people who
had depth of care and operational
excellence and experience in building
organizations who have had successful
business outcomes in our industry I
really desperately think that this is
what's needed and we're starting to see
it happen and it makes me so
 
[Applause]

happy hey everybody welcome back to the
HR Heretics podcast where we get into
the real talk of company construction
these are the conversations that
happened between Founders Chief people
officers and board members behind closed
doors we're heretic in this industry
because there's a culture of Silence
around important business topics
especially with people but on the show
we tell the truth and expect the same
from our guests today our episode is
with Caitlyn Holloway Caitlyn is a
partner at 776 the VC firm she and
Alexis Ohanian run together Caitlyn was
the former VP of people at Reddit and
worked at clout and Pixar before that
she's also known to many HR Pros because
she's the host of a podcast called All
Hands from Lattis which is awesome yeah
kin's episode is awesome um candidly I'm
an Alexis Ohanian Fanboy for those of
you who don't know he's also married to
Serena Williams uh who's like the goat I
loved hearing about Caitlyn's
relationship with Alexis and how that's
fostered and changed over the last nine
years yeah this was a good one Caitlyn's
also the goat in my opinion her passion
Nolan around Venture and chief people
officers and HR leaders roles being more
prominent inventure
was phenomenal we haven't gone deep on
that on the show and she had again
incredible passion around it shared how
investing is basically parallel to
recruiting those processes and and her
kind of tips and tricks around Equity
advising for those of you who are
interested and kind of fast agreements
and how to do that and what that looks
like yeah Kaitlin's take on Talent
partners and that she believes more HR
professionals should actually have
access to the checkbook versus forced
into the back office to help with
recruiting I thought was a really
interesting lens I also loved her takes
on you know doing something hard builds
bonds faster as it relates to Human
Relationships like she's so spot on
about that and then also how she thinks
about leaving companies and leaving
companies when you're happy versus sad
or frustrated yeah behind the Venture
piece and the investing piece that was
probably my favorite part of this this
episode is is around leaving companies
which we've all done i' I've had that
fork many times in my career and how to
think about it it's such a great
framework and so I think our audience is
absolutely going to love this episode
but before we jump into the interview
with Caitlyn we just want to take a
quick moment to shout out an awesome
resource for people operators it's HR
brew and it probably doesn't need any
introduction but it's a free weekday
newsletter that's highly curated
covering the most critical industry
College yes it has been indispensable
for me for a while now coming into my
inbox they do a great job Nolan which
just really quick concise like sound
bites of HR news that you can kind of
consume under 5 10 minutes versus we
know sometimes the Rat Hole of LinkedIn
and you're there for an hour so the
newsletters they link to resources
strategy guides you know debates that
you and I love to have on the bleeding
edge like recruiting retention hybrid
work comp h R Tech it's pretty
invaluable I agree I think it's actually
a no-brainer
 
check out the link in our profile please
go subscribe to them in addition to what
we're doing here awesome now let's get
into it here's our conversation with
Caitlyn everybody Caitlin thanks so much
for joining us on the show thank you so
much for having me I'm thrilled to be
here so I I want to just start quickly
with your background you're currently a
partner at 77
you were also the head of people at
Reddit from like 70 to more than 700 and
then you were also at clout way back in
the day which actually was like one of
the hottest companies and employee
number 21 at clout how did you initially
get into people in HR H that is a good
question yeah I've done a lot in my
career I've been I've been around a
minute um and and I'm I'm settling into
that fact that that's a good thing um
because I I feel like my entire career
I've always felt um like something was
new or that I was the the the newest kid
in the party and had a lot to learn and
I'm I'm recently settling into the fact
it's like oh yeah no I've I've got a
significant amount of experience under
my belt um that I can draw on right and
so from um so yeah how did I get into HR
um was totally an accident um I a lot of
the best folks in in our industry are
people who I think will say HR found me
um you know on my own podcast all hands
with Lattis I get every time I ask that
question um even just in the warm-up it
it's almost always HR found me um and I
think the part of that is because the
world of HR prior to what 15 years ago
was so Antiquated and it was so not a
destination career it was not sexy it
was not uh compelling to want people to
go into it necessarily and there there
are special Souls who looked at that and
said yes that's for me and bless them um
but I I think that most people found it
on accident because it was they were
naturally drawn to or they were in an
organization where people were coming to
them people were confiding in them and
so it really was a community role an
internal Community role and and the
people who be who eventually transferred
into the industry myself included were
the ones who said gosh I think that
there is a pattern here I think that
there's a trend here or there is a there
is a process here that is missing that I
can I can see and I can see clear as day
and then you go and you find the
internal resources to build and then the
next thing you know you wake up in a
boardroom meeting and you're like oh I'm
the HR person how did that happen um and
that's what happened to me uh so prior
to getting into the world of tech and
the world of HR I was um at Pixar
Animation Studios where I never held an
HR position um but what I like to say is
I was a client and a very happy client
of uh the HR and people function at
Pixar and I really credit that team with
teaching me so much about what great HR
looks like because prior to that
experience I worked in a number of
different Industries uh with a lot of
different types of cultures and I was
not necessarily a happy customer so
seeing it done really right and really
well um was was fascinating to me and so
when I eventually left the studio and I
did move into Tech it was it was an
opportunity to take all of the
incredible things that I learned there
as a customer to say gosh I love the way
they built out their Learning and
Development system again this is before
Learning and Development was something
that was in you know that we were
talking about in other types of
organizations but Pixar was so well
suited to be a Pioneer in many of these
spaces because they were such a creative
industry and they really a big part of
their their culture and their value set
was building outside of the system right
and so I was able to say you know
looking at the Pixar University model
for example they didn't call it Learning
and Development it was the Pixar
University and it's funny because it's
called pu and so you'd be like Oh I'm
going to my pu class and the beauty of
that program was they allowed anybody in
the studio regardless of your role your
title your tenure your salary anything
could attend any Course and there were
things you know ranging from learning
Photoshop you know Photoshop 101 to fly
fishing they they saw that you could
develop a deep relationships and move
the business forward and unpack and and
discover creative ideas that could then
be put into the film or put into a part
of the process from all different parts
of the organization and so for me that
was not we need to have a Learning and
Development uh system it was how do we
live the value great ideas come from
anywhere and so I was like oh that's one
example of like you are doing this so
right and I benefited from that from a
growth and development standpoint I
learned so much then I was able to
create internal opportunities for myself
to try things and do things and build
relationships with people that I
otherwise would have never had that
opportunity and so when I left and I
went into the world of tech I was like
oh I'm going to pack up my little
backpack with some of those great things
that I experienced that little Pixar
fairy dust and I can apply them to Young
budding growing organizations that are
just in that nent you know earliest
stages and then grow it and so my my
goal was never to go into HR my goal was
to say oh that was such an awesome lived
experience I want other people to
experience and I Don't Care What My
Title is and then so I had the same
experience where one day I woke up you
know three months into my gig at clout
and I I'd made up some title like Direct
of Creative Solutions but I basically
was the only non-engineer non-product
person I was doing EA work I was doing
office management work I was doing
Finance HR I was doing all of the things
that no one else had had was able to
pick up in the organization at that
particular moment and and I was like oh
my goodness it's HR and then I was able
to then articulate because I had a great
relationship and partner with the
founder and CEO Joe Fernandez to and he
gave me the space to say if you don't
want to be traditional HR what does this
look like and so he gave me the the you
know the the blue sky space to really
create the job that I felt was missing
while still you know maintaining and
managing the important parts of
compliance tea Crossing eye dotting
making sure people were serviced
appropriately but not necessarily having
that be the core part of my role Kaylin
do you think that like same right when
we were starting out you know and I'm
old too now but no one explicitly chose
it no one said I want that um do you
think that's changed absolutely yes and
I am so glad that it has I am so glad
that that finally the work that is done
uh by this function is being valued it
is being recognized and not just um
financially right the the the the
compensation now is it matches the
importance um and it's but it's also
being seen in the boardroom the addition
of of the the person leading this
function is now in most boardrooms in at
least in tech and and you know early
stage companies and now later stage
companies we're seeing in the public
sector now as well um but but also the
joy right sharing the joy of this work
and someone saying like gosh I was
naturally kind of doing this maybe I was
an office manager and this this work
kind of started coming to me and I I
finally feel like I have purpose and
value and so yes I think it's changed I
think it's awesome yeah I agree I I was
one of those who actually chose it if
you can believe it but it was kind of by
luck it was like 1998 and one of my
professors in college was like what do
you want to do I'm like I don't know I
like business but not enough to like
take a county and I like people but I
don't want to like talk to people on
couches all day what and they said have
you heard of industrial organizational
psych and I was like you're going to

working with Alexis aanan now for I
think about nine years um Alexis is a
legend in Silicon Valley um he's also
married to Serena which makes him a
legend kind of now globally um how did
you meet Alexis and how is that
relationship evolved over time yeah um
you're right Alexa this is our third
Rodeo now together um so how I met him
was he uh he hired me at Reddit um so
during the big turnaround um I think
that we first met in
 
it was through a fantastic recruiter who
uh you know classic I wasn't looking for
a job blah blah blah and and had you
know the strategy of the recruiter I
thought was fantastic she kept telling
me every time we met because I was
actually hiring which is the only reason
I was talking with her and um and she
would you know pick my brain I I have
this interesting company I'm having
trouble finding the best candidate it's
so unique and then she would present me
with a challenge the company was having
and so in my next weekly sync with her I
she knew I was stewing on it think about
but she wouldn't tell me the name of the
company and so i' come back thinking
about the challenges this organization
was facing i' be like have they thought
about this have you have you have you
introduced someone with this profile
blah blah blah and then soon enough I
was already in love she knew I was
invested and so put came to sh she
actually did not tell me the name of the
company until I was in in Uber getting
out on site that's because that's how
bad of a brand the the company was at
that particular moment wow yeah they had
had three CEOs in less than a year they
were in the news for all the wrong
reasons um and they were this was the
beginning of the turnaround and um and
so I was one of the first executive
hires that was made by that that team um
including Alexis to to say hey something
that we want to do different in this
chapter and something we know that's
deeply important is is finally put a
focus on people and so I was one of the
first um executive hirers to come in for
that turnaround period um I think I
technically started in 2016 beginning
but I I've been talking with them for
several several months um so I I feel
like I've known Alexis for longer than I
have um because of that process and then
you know we were in the trenches
together that turnaround was was um a
phenomenal uh experience for me both
professionally um uh deep deep learnings
um and and then also building my network
and my relationships and I think that
when you are doing something very hard I
think that most of us have had this
experience when you are truly doing
something that is very very very hard um
it builds a deeper Bond faster and so
having been in the trenches with alexas
having you know we we our employees when
I started refused to wear the company
merch on the Street they wouldn't wear
the swag uh because they were they would
get bullied or picked on or they were
embarrassed to work at that that company
at that time and so to see the
transition and and that's you know
that's such a small indicator of of the
health of an organization but but the
amount of change that we were able to
create together as that that newly
formed leadership team um was one of the
best rides of my career uh it was
absolutely fantastic and so because of
that we became very close and eventually
Alexis left the company again to go back
to initialized Capital which was the
Venture Capital firm he had started um
you know even prior he had been a
partner at YC uh because he was in the
first graduating class there with the
rest of those interesting Silicon Valley
kind of gang uh that have all you know
carve their own names into our our
textbooks of that chapter um and so
anyway we we had stayed in touch and
because we had worked so closely
together and he he was aware of my work
my my service level my quality and uh
the things that i' done just by by
witnessing it um I became the phona
friend uh over at initialize so I began
advising for portfolio companies over
there um and I found that work to be
absolutely uh joyful because I was you
know very very deep at Reddit working
very very um hard and closely with the
teams um across the the the entire
company um after the company had been
stabilized which you know collectively
we were able to do fairly quickly all
things considered and so I was I was now
going very deep with the work and so
bringing on operators and bringing on
different people to service different
parts of the people and culture function
within the organization um and so it was
frankly really lovely for me to have
that that change in Pace where yeah I'll
take a 30- minute call or or grab a
quick coffee with a Founder who was you
know coming coming to Alexis's door as
their investing partner saying hey I
have to fire someone I've never done
that before he's like oh you got to talk
to Caitlyn or o we just got a new round
of funding and we have to build our
sales organization I don't know how to
structure it oh you got to talk to
Caitlyn to like oh I got to break up
with my co-founder I don't know how to
do that and Alexis was like talk to
Caitlyn and so that was how I I began to
get introduced to like institutional
investing um was simply by having this
uh wonderful you know change of pace in
my day and I wasn't doing a lot of it it
was it was just enough to keep me you
know like oh that's cool so I can
empathize yeah just enough to keep the
lights going and and you want to take
the calls so that's great but kayin your
your acceleration Adventure has been
just so freaking fun to watch and I know
you have such a strong point of view and
are making a lot of noise in a great way
about more of you more of us more of
people leaders into Venture and I'd love
to talk about it I'm so glad that you
were bringing this up because this is
Absolut absolutely one of my biggest
points of passion right now um I I feel
so lucky to have entered the the
workforce within the people and culture
sphere when I did it was it was such an
incredible moment and period and time of
change and I I talk about it as you know
dragging HR out of the back room into
the boardroom chapter of our industry um
and to come in that as someone who
wasn't you know quote unquote
classically trained I didn't you know
get my my masters and um well what was
it Kelly organiz industrial
organization exactly but it's awesome
because the the community that existed
that predated you know HR 2.0 was so
open and willing and saying yes yes yes
let's link arms um and so there was no
US versus them when when this moment of
change this this this need for you know
the change Catalyst that had to occur to
to make that happen not just for our
industry for the sake of our own career
development but really for the sake of
business business outcomes right and and
so beating my fists on the table around
business outcomes where this is not nice
to have this is not soft fluffy let's
make the HR folk feel seen this was
about how do we augment business
outcomes and so what occurred to me you
know after I feel like we've had this
this major Revolution I again I'm bad
with dates and time but I would say this
this probably the shift really started
to happen about 15 years ago but but
where we are now is is now it is just
common place which is exactly where you
want to get that that the voice of human
resources or people in culture is heard
and reverberates throughout the
organization and that that is inclusive
of the boardroom it is inclusive of the
executive room and so feeling like we
had won I was getting to the end of my
my tenure at Reddit knowing that you
know there there was a potential exit on
the horizon and having worked at a
public company having worked at a
private company that then went public I
know that that's my jam um and there are
people better suited to lead that that
part of the organization than me I knew
that I I was needing to make a
transition and I was looking down the
the path I was I was staring at the fork
in the road and I thought okay I can go
and run a Playbook that I know and love
and work that I'm deeply and desperately
passionate about again um finding
another Reddit was going to be hard for
me I had such deep love and connection
and care for that that group um and for
what we had built and so you know there
was there's always the fear of of
leaving something that is wonderful um
but I will tell you this in my career
I've always left my companies when I
have been the most happy uh not when
I've been the most sad or frustrated and
that has developed into incredible
opportunity for me and there's you know
there there's always some Miss and some
some amount of regret but that's no
that's not true there's no regret there
is Miss I I miss and I yearn for certain
times in certain chapters but the best
part about leaving a company is you
still got to take the best parts with
you which are the people and the
relationships right and so I say that to
say if you are thinking about it or you
were concerned go if it's in your heart
go it's so funny I I agree like when I
whenever I've left it's usually usually
been on that and it it creates a
different Dynamic it's almost like
you're still there right like that that
work continues those relationships
continue those people from a company 10
years ago called me last week to help
them with something I mean it's it's
that that's a very great way of thinking
about it and so it's not really by it's
see you later and let me just keep
compounding these great experiences with
the next ones versus kind of sitting
there till The Bitter End I mean
Seinfeld went out in a high I still
watch it totally that's a great analogy
that's a great analogy because it's it's
so easy to get stuck in the Trap of
maybe this thing has evolved or changed
for me and it's not serving me anymore
but I love so much about this part that
I that I'll hang on and and so I think
it's a about there there are two things
for me that have helped those
transitions be successful one is trying
to do my best to be self-aware about my
needs and and where where my needs are
being met and so in the example of you
know I was I was starting to advise for
initialized Capital and I found myself
drifting more towards thinking about
those companies and those relationships
I was like that's a sign so when it
became more than just a oh this is a
lovely distraction for you know a half
hour a week to I really want to go
deeper with that person or I I I want to
take two or three calls this week so
that was an indicator for me that
something was shifting in myself um and
then the other part was really being
able to have a great dialogue with your
leader right your with the person that
that you are working and serving within
that that organization and to be able to
have those conversations say like I'm
having these thoughts and feelings or
you know I know that I'm not best suited
to take us through IPO I like I I can
get us to this point very effectively
but like I want to be really honest for
again business out comes I want the best
person leading this um and so those are
two things that have helped me identify
like when to to LEAP from the top of the
roller coaster as opposed to fall off at
the bottom I can go and I can go
in-house and run this again and do the
work that I love and I may find a hitter
I might not who knows um and I'm willing
to roll that dice if that's the work
that I think that I'm supposed to do now
or I can really lean into this work that
I've been doing with initialized which
it had become very clear to me that all
of the critical skill sets needed for
early stage investing after the check is
written they are people skills they are
the skill sets that I've been building
for 10 years at that point to say you
know whether it is finding that that
deal right so that's that's a function
of recruiting it's you you must have a
healthy built relationship and network
within an area that you are passionate
about and so for me it was HR technology
so I had started Angel Investing along
the way which is something worth calling
out I was both advising for initialized
also nurturing my own personal portfolio
because I was deeply passionate about
the tools and Technology needed for for
me and our industry so that I could
spend my time doing the work that I
loved most which was the creative
strategic empathetic work and so I
needed technology to enable that so that
we could scale um and so I I was like
Wow after you write the check though so
after you identify that founder or that
company that you say this is this is it
again the parallel between recruiting
and that is the same it is the same
skill set the same mental even the same
spreadsheets for me it's the work that I
knew and so maybe I I do it differently
but that's your deal flow right so you
have your funnel so just like a
candidate funnel you're bringing people
on top you're keeping relationships
alive who's moving where you understand
the ecosystem and then you were you were
whittling it down to who is exactly the
best person for this job the difference
is is it was not who's going to be my
next head of sales it was is this person
the right person to lead this
organization in a CEO role right so same
same in terms of skill set and then
after the check is written which a lot
of people arue myself included
um that first chapter of company
building preed seed stage it's that zero
to
one almost all of those challenges are
going to be people challenges not all
you have to find product Market there
are so many components to to that stage
of business building but so much of that
is building early teams uh functional
dynamics of those teams compensation so
how do I fairly compensate how do I
build my cap table with those early
employees around Equity how do I deal
with remote and distributed work so oh
my gosh I found a great person but
they're based in such and such and I'm
here all of these things are the work
that we are already doing we're just
doing it inside of one organization and
so it occurred to me as I was advising
for a number of these companies and as I
was developing my own portfolio I was
like why don't more HR people uh work in
Venture and so then I went down a rabbit
hole of investigating who are the people
who have these backgrounds where are
they sitting within the functional
organization within venture capital I
started to educate myself on the
industry the areas of opacity which by
the way there are many uh and that is by
Design I have learned as I've gotten
deeper into this field um but what I
what I discovered
was the people who had the same skill
sets as me were sitting in the back room
they are sitting in the back room and
they are given the title of either HR so
internal HR so they are leading HR for a
venture capital firm or they are called
Talent partner and the work that that
Talent partner is given is almost
exclusively recruiting so a glorified
executive recruiter and I say that not
because I want to speak ill of anyone
with the um Talent partner title but to
actually speak very positively of them
and say they're capable of doing so much
more and having such a bigger impact
again on the business outcomes so it is
a venture capitalist job a a firm's role
that the reason they exist is to create
outsized returns how do you create
outsized returns in early stage
investing you're making let's say you
put 10 bets on the table nine of those
 
next stb so how do you increase that
number from one to two to maybe three
and then how do you help then those
companies who graduate grow and continue
to take on um you know additional growth
in terms of um business
success how we can do that is through
the people's skill set so giving them
the tools so oftentimes early stage
companies the founder is not going to
come with a deep deep people uh
management background right they're
coming because they're good at being
Builders whether that's product
engineering whatever the case may be
maybe they're a Visionary with a great
idea that came from the world of sales
or marketing that exists too but they
typically are not having that depth of
operational expertise around building
companies from the ground up HR folk we
are we can do that and so I was like
wait why are these folks being relegated
to the back room so similar to from
moving from film into Tech saying why is
a CH sitting in the back room I'm asking
the same question again again and and
what I've discovered is is that there's
not a good reason it's because there was
an archetype built by an industry around
a very particular type of of background
which happens to be finance and and
maybe you're an ex entrepreneur uh but
you know when you look at even
applications at Venture Capital
firms oftentimes there will be a drop
down that says what school did you go to
and it will say Stanford MIT uh
Harvard Wharton whatever the the five
are this is how bad the game I
am and then that's it and I'm like
that's it yo that's how you're there's
not there's not other well I think what
they would say I think what I think what
they would say Caitlyn is that there's
um the skill of company picking takes
time to learn and Company picking is a
lot different than company operating and
Company picking is a lot of uh pattern
matching it's a lot of understanding how
history has worked especially history
and recent Tech and so I'd say that's
one skill set that I that I have
personally heard the other one is the
the mark andreon quote which I'll
butcher but it's something along the
lines of like most adventure is negative
selection and the positive selection
adventure of the companies you really
want to take your money they have to
pick you and so this is where like you
know there's always this flight to
Quality and and you guys are a part of
this it's 776 for sure but it's always
like the seoa and the Andre these 7 s6s
of the world that are thought of as
these tier ones to where good Founders
actually come to you and want you to
write the check and so that's where I I
I'm actually curious to get your take on
this is how does an HR person crack in
when that is what they're competing
against I and before that a point no and
I like to spar a little bit you know if
you haven't realized but the picking a
lot of these and cait I love your
thoughts on this is is picking the
founder right I've heard Oodles of times
and I agree with it you're not investing
in usually the thing or the widget
you're investing in that human you're
investing in that founder which now
we're back to recruiting and exactly
what you talked about Caitlyn so I'd
love you to weave that in too but I I do
believe that I I believe that
wholeheartedly and I and I I think that
I want to make it clear I think that
this is a yes and this is a you know we
just need more perspective at the table
and different skill sets at the table so
this is not again this is I my intention
is not to poo poo on anyone there is a
reason that the indre and seoa um have
landed their place as tier ones um and
there's also a reason they are growing
the teams now in this new chapter as we
are I think that we are about to we are
at the precipice we are sitting on this
edge of of shift and change it is a
platform shift it is a seminal moment in
technology and and the broader ecosystem
the broader economy the the global
economy right in this moment in time so
so we're talking it's January 2024 we
are at the beginning of 2024 and the
reality is is you know we have an
incredible technology shift happening um
the the advancement and accessibility of
AI is going to have a huge impact on how
we work where our money goes how it
develops and this is not a debate on is
AI taking our jobs I promise um but that
that is a huge platform shift we are at
a seminal moment with that alone but now
you add to that we also have the
complexity of what's going on here
domestically in America it's it's an
election year there are so many things
and if we look back at last year and the
amount of you know Black Swan events
that even just came out of nothingness
and nowhere seemingly um that changed
and impacted the way we do business is
changing us and so Venture Capital has
been undisrupted despite them investing
in disruptive companies for you know the
last several
decades is no longer working and and so
Nolan I love that you bring it up
because what we are seeing in the more
traditional Venture Capital firms is
they are growing the part of their
internal business that actually leans
more on support than selection and so
the support teams and you know depending
on on what flavor and variety of of firm
you're going to look at and dissect is
oftentimes the platform team they call
it platform where they are bringing in
you know tools and and support you know
from operational um different
operational parts of the business so
they they have robust advisor programs
they had very robust you know
entrepreneur and residence programs
things where people actually say I I
know this and i' I've built this myself
and so I can give you real actionable
support I have big beef to pick with how
those are currently structured and I
don't actually think that they will
translate well into this new chapter but
I do think that the reason one of the
reasons that that we stand out in a in a
crowded Market to say please take our
money um is because we have built our
reputation um around being product and
people first and because we are we have
built ourselves out of that traditional
box of you must have gone to Sanford and
studied X Y and Z and have a deep you
know Finance background our team just
looks different when you look at our
profiles and you look at how we've
designed our our not only our team but
our processes and so you know one thing
that we built is is called our growth
and caregiving program where we actually
are carving out dollars for every
investment we make into a pre-seed and
Seed Stage Company to actually support
the human and Kelly to your point the
human who is building this because
Founders are you know they are strapped
for cash especially right now in this
market everything is about reducing your
burn rate and so the last thing they're
going to invest in is heaven forbid
mental health heaven forbid you know
taking that date night and having a
babysitter um you know all of these
things that make us different is is I
think the new model and I'm I'm I don't
say that to to toot my own horn or to
Pat ourselves on the back too
aggressively what you are seeing are
more and more firms Shifting the way
they work and more firms emerging who
are doing things differently and because
of that that is how we're going to get
more checkbooks not not back room gigs
for people who have deep deep HR
experience this is how we're going to
get the the checkbook in those hands and
that is my goal I really desperately
think that our world would be a better
place if we had more people who
had depth of care and operational
excellence and experience in building
organizations who have had successful
business outcomes in our industry I
really desperately think that this is
what's needed and we're starting to see
it happen and it makes me so
happy yeah I I mean you're one Jessica
Neil at tcv is another one that
immediately comes to mind I was sitting
next to her at dinner a few weeks ago
and talking to her about her experience
and she has checkbook power as well um I
want to to to quickly go back to what
you had mentioned about the current
operating model and you having a gripe
with the the current operating model
because I I do as well um right now I
think a lot of the tier ones have a very
large staff of Specialists all the way
from HR recruiting sales marketing
engineering product design and the list
goes on and some of these staffs are
massive but disruption and Venture is
actually happening I think a lot faster
than people realize Founders who are at
the grow stage right now are telling me
like nobody's writing grow stage checks
anymore uh there's only a handful of
companies that are really like series B
and Beyond like getting these things
done and I I find that that stage is
really where the disruption is happening
and there's going to be a forced change
onto these VC firms specifically with
how they're doing their operating model
what's your take and why do you have a
gripe with the way things are currently
run we do not have have enough time for
me to get on this note box but I I will
try to summarize it uh by by saying I
one I think that there is a ton of
untapped talent that already exists in
these folks but they are siloed um so I
can I can I literally and I won't name
them uh there
are several people I know who either
have you know a platform title a talent
partner title title an operating partner
title whatever they're calling it that
have so much more capacity and ability
to help support companies but they are
siloed so sometimes and oftentimes um
you have one partner leading a deal they
are the only one that has the
relationship with that portfolio company
and so depending on what their
background is they are able to service
and support in one small part of the
whole and so when they are like oh
you're asking me for something that's
outside of my area of expertise or
something that I feel like I have real
experience that I can support you with
I'm going to go to the back room I'm
going to knock on the door of the
platform team or the operating partner
team or the adviser team we the Scout
program team and I'm going to say hey
can anyone help so and so with such and
such and then you pass the Baton that
person says sure I'll hop on a call they
got on a call and guess what they have
zero context context is everything so
just again this is HR work this is this
is the real this is employee relations
this is where you are being the manager
of this relationship and to tag someone
in and bail out the other side is not
helpful for anyone it's a waste of
everyone's time I have yet to see one
that is collaborative and this is
something that that I I do think I'm
starting to see a shift in that I
believe that Alexis was really a Pioneer
on which was um building our own
operating system and so we are a remote
and distributed team and he built us a
software called cerebro and through
cerebro it does so many things and I
won't get on that tangent either right
now but for this use case one beautiful
thing that cbro brings our firm is full
transparency so we believe in full
transparency on all things including how
we support our portfolio companies and
so every partner at the firm every
individual at the firm we have 11 folks
today every single person anytime they
have a touch point with a Founder it
goes into cerebro and it reads actually
like Reddit so you're you can read a
timeline on a company's history based on
every single touch point and so maybe
Chris on my team had a workshop with one
of my Founders uh where you know they
they pinged them and you know he also
has an HR background so I'm I'm living
what I say um I really think there's a
huge spot for this so maybe Chris is
running a workshop on on compensation
and design around you know Fair pay
Equity with one of my Founders in that
conversation he might pick up a little
nugget on like there seems to be a
little Discord between those co-founders
and so he's putting this in his note
because he's recognizing something he's
flag it but that's not the purpose of
his conversation he's there to talk
about compensation now me as the partner
I see this context and I can write and
say Chris get in there there is Discord
I would love to get your take on it um
or maybe it's a past fancy and I read it
the next day cuz we're async and I get
in there and I'm like oh I didn't know
there was Discord I need to get in there
having transparency and UNS siloing
relationships is critical so that's one
shift that I think we're going to see
software enables that but just generally
context um is helpful and then the
second part is there is a power Dynamic
to the way these relationships are set
up the partner has the power right so
that everyone wants to inventure
everyone's climbing the ladder to get to
I'm an investor I have a checkbook I
have checkw writing autonomy and
Authority therefore I am win and I am
the best that is wrong that is wrong no
one human uh should not not I have to be
very careful with my words here I do not
believe that that is an effective way to
to operate to achieve outsized returns
and so we at our firm we do almost
everything collaboratively so we take
our pitches all together we support coll
collaboratively by doing it that way we
are able to not just better support our
Founders and Nolan to your point we're
entering a chapter where we're going to
see a mass extinction of early stage
companies because those checks are not
on the other side right now and that
sounds very doom and gloomy but I think
that this is It's a but it's a call to
action to the venture capitalist to step
in and actually do their part actually
show up as the partner you promised and
keep the analogy going I mean one
checkbook one decision maker it's the
same thing as giving a hiring manager
full autonomy to like it's the same
freaking thing you know just to keep it
going exactly yes I guess Caitlyn
question for you I'm just thinking of
the audience here and what I'd want to
know right you're you're a master at all
of this your journey to get here has
been long like it could be daunting for
those on the call like ooh I still what
what are what are one to two things that
folks in the operating seat maybe
they're in the operating seat for a
period of months or years before they
think about this what should they be
doing now to like have the confidence
and the ability to to be that Army you
speak of and and and like replicate you
right because there should be hundreds
of us at some point what can they do now
to get to get these skills best question
ever I love this because I actually have
an
answer um and this wasn't scripted no
not at all I I than you swear um because
I actually don't know that I've shared
this anywhere awesome and I've thought a
lot about it because to your point like
this is what I want this is what I
believe our world needs right now this
not just our industry but like I
genuinely believe that that we will have
better products in the market if we have
more variety of people in making that
investment selection and then supporting
those Founders on their journey I
genuinely believe like I don't know I'm
not going to say venture capital is
caring cancer then some cases yes if you
were doing bio but like but what I'm
trying to say is like I I genuinely
think that this is how we can push
things forward from our seat in the
house my biggest piece of advice would
be building your relationship with
Founders and I say that and it sounds
opposite than like build relationship
with investors or build relationships
with Venture Capital firms it's actually
build your relationship and build your
reputation with Founders so there is
this unspoken like NPS score between
Founders that say that person was
helpful that person was not and there is
a meme amongst Venture capitalists
around asking the empty ass excuse me
empty question of excuse my we swear
here Kaitlyn so okay I I listened to the
show but I didn't want to be the one to
break it just no no we swear here no ear
muffs needed just let her rip thank you
thank you there is nothing more
frustrating than than a VC showing up
saying uh how can I be helpful and then
literally ghosting and that is what
occurs nine times out of 10 and so uh
the the answer or the solution here is
how can you be helpful so if all these
people who do have the check writing
Authority the power the control in
making these investment decisions if
they are only now good for a check and
that's a bold statement but if that is
your only purpose and that is your only
value ad these Founders are going other
places to find the help and support they
need and so what I discovered early in
my advising days and my Angel Investing
days was that I was the only person in
their orbit and on their cap table and I
can talk about how you get on cap tables
without money because I also think
that's that's a barrier that want to
remove for people because often times
that venture has very intentionally put
money as a blocker uh for to get people
into the industry and so I have tools
and techniques on how to do it but there
there there is a very clear path if you
have this skill set you are Auto Value
ad to any founder and so by by looking
into your own network and your
relationships that you have around
people who are out there actually doing
the hard work of building a company by
being a source of value for them
genuinely and truly I guarantee you you
will be be the only one in their orbit
let's start with in their orbit not just
on their cap table and maybe not yet but
you will be the one that they come to
time and time again and when when
someone asks them dear so and so who has
been the most helpful is they is they
are ringing the bell on IPO day or they
just have have sold their company for a
few billion dollars think back to that
first chapter who was the most helpful
person if it is your name because you
coached them through how to break up
with their co-founder or you help bring
on their new coo who changed the name of
the game at a milestone
moment that is your reputation and that
is your
investor that is absolutely your
investor reputation and brand and so
start with the founders they talk they
talk a lot it is a tree system through
the roots that is quiet that we don't
see and we don't hear but if you can do
that eventually your name will start
coming up in in boardrooms it will
eventually start coming up as they talk
to their investing Partners they're like
you promised me things and you have
given me zil Point this person over
here actually helped me when I needed it
and then they now the inv is going to
say who is that person why and so that
honestly was how I broke in was by
simply building my name and my
reputation amongst the best Founders in
the world yep I love it I know no one
has a followup yeah let me build off
that really fast because like as a
Founder I can hyperv validate what you
just said I think the best advice I get
is when it is uh coming from somebody
who has deep experience in the thing
that I need advice on and then the
second best advice I get is I don't know
but I know someone that does and I can
put you in contact with them and I find
that the worst advice I get is when
someone is trying to give me advice on a
topic that they actually don't know
about and instead of saying I don't know
like let me connect you to the right
person and that is actually even more
helpful uh when I get it from like hey I
don't know this answer because then I
trust you more cuz if you're willing to
tell me that you don't know something
but you know someone that does and
you're willing to make that connection
for me that is how you be helpful to a
Founder on and and specifically on the
cap table and I want to just quickly and
you know plus one on you for the um
dollars have been a barrier to entry um
nowadays with the angelist ruv you can
invest in companies for as cheaply as
like a th000 bucks and I always tell
other Founders to do the r UV and to get
as many high quality people as you can
on the cap table because it is the
highest amount of value per dollar
because honestly like those are the
people who you can pick up and basically
use as your own personal expert Network
to go solve problems as the company
scales so I'm I I think you just
completely nailed it right there Kaitlin
and again it's similar advice that I've
heard that I give I'm sure you all have
and what successful people officers
operators are they can work with
Founders and most importantly Founders
want to work with them right that brand
follows you and the The Venture is
you're literally working with maybe 40
Founders now not one or four I feel like
the Venture World Caitlyn I you agree or
disagree it's good news for me like you
know the last 15 years you mentioned
plus or minus the people role has gotten
very popular very needed much more
respect um a table Stakes business
operator equal peer role I feel like the
vent I feel like the Venture world is
kind of just starting that same path
meaning we're kind of fighting right now
uh Talent partner
recruiting I've gotten you know a couple
calls from VC's and it's probably some
sometime in my future but th those those
random ones that pop out well we get it
I feel like 15 years from now I hope
every VC has one of us to do that not
just the recruiting side so I'd like to
simplify things in my brain but I feel
like that journey is the same one that
we went through with freaking companies
respecting people officers it's just
inventure exactly it it is coming and I
can feel it I feel the last few years I
think Co really started to shift that
investor founder relationship and
therefore is challenging the current
system um and and how things have been
done historically and I I want to I want
to quickly go back to give one tactical
piece of advice for people going back to
that money component of how do I become
even an investor and build my my own
book um I I actually became an
accidental investor I didn't know that I
was actually building an angel portfolio
because the the first five years of
doing so I wasn't spending a dime I was
an adviser I was advising I was getting
because friends would be building things
not even my direct friends but Nolan to
your point I was being introduced by
someone who was being introduced by
someone who was saying hey I think that
she might have a connection for you she
might be able to help you and so in
doing that I got really lucky by meeting
Founders who were very generous to say
wow every time we get a coffee I leave
feeling inspired and I feel like I have
great tactical things I can go employ
today and I would like to give you
equity and in the beginning I was like
whatever fine sure and it was like you
know 5,000 shares a thousand shares like
like like you know little Rinky Dink
things and it was like sure fine and
then all of a sudden I started to see
those build and I started to see some
liquidity and this is coming from a poor
kid who grew up with with not very much
and suddenly I was going wait I put zero
dollars in and I just got a check for
$10,000 uh for free and when I'm looking
at it I can go on my calendar and say
wow I in total I had three hours worth
of meetings with that person that's a
good use of my time and so right and and
not all of them are gonna hit I'm not
promising that but I'm saying if you can
build those relationships and then and
then be in a position to where a Founder
is actually offering you money and what
I've learned also now that I'm on the
the other side is a lot of venture
Partners actually discourage Founders
from giving Equity to advisers so I
found because often times their friends
from their their college days or
experience be like oh he was my frat
brother and then they aren't actually
providing value and then they're asking
for equity and there's this whole scheme
that's going on that I'm not interested
in however if you know that you have a
good relationship with a founder or
working within a a company that is not
yours and you are spending your time and
your energy with them there is something
and I learned this from uh Jack Alman
who is the former CEO of Lis the founder
of ltis um he was one of the first
Founders to to gift me Equity just
simply for showing up and and answering
his calls whether it was for building
the product or helping him internally um
and I will forever be grateful to him
for that but there is something called a
fast agreement so we've all heard of a
safe agreement you know it's the fast YC
way to do it there is an advisor
agreement that that is equally as as
like it's already been pressure tested
it's used a bazillion times and
so0 and you can have an agreement with a
Founder it's they can go and run it with
their lawyers they'll get the green
check instantly to say I would like to
invite you onto my cap table and so now
you you don't have to deal with a single
penny out again if you would like to I
agree no there's there are so many
awesome ways now to have much smaller
dollar amounts in to to build your
portfolio but you can also do it with
existing relationships and so that is
the the Tactical advice I will leave the
audience but the biggest thing is
delivering Value First you you have to
deliver value first though yes yes you
cannot
yes 100% and people get this people get
this
wrong all the time like this is like the
number one thing I see wrong with people
who like want to advise is they show up
being like well how much you going to
give me and it's like no that is not the
way that this relationship works it is
you give a ton of free value and then
the founder says I would like to invite
you as an adviser on my cap table that's
the only way that this thing works and
that's where Founders I've seen get
rubbed the wrong way is they get
introduced to a quote unquote expert and
the expert shows up being like well you
know I'm 500 bucks an hour or I only you
know work for uh a quarter of a bip and
every time the founder is like no thanks
I'll just pass um versus is the people
who have these long lists of Investments
and advisor ships they almost never ask
because they deliver so much value it
becomes almost impossible for the
founder to pick up the phone and not
feel terrible that they aren't
compensating them in such a way exactly
and that's why I say your existing
relationships like where so if you have
a Founder say like I would love to but I
don't know how or my VC you know my my
my partner my primary investor won't let
me I'm so that's so I'm glad to
clarified I would never ever totally and
correct me if I'm wrong Nolan I mean you
have to enjoy it you have to literally
be genuine about wanting to freaking
help I mean I think I talked to at least
two to three founder CEOs a month just
like for free like I I love it you know
hey they have a question they're
interested they're hiring ahead of
people you make connections you give
back those relationships continue I mean
some of those have gone on to be Equity
based advisers other haven't it's it's
fine cuz it all works out and Founders
can tell right I mean I we all get as
humans you can tell whether you're there
for a certain agenda or you're kind of
half in for for a dollar versus this is
what I love doing I love building
relationships I want to help you and
that genuinely leads out so that's
always take the calls it it never hurts
you know and and and give give back
totally one of the most um reputable and
well-known advisers that I know actually
won't even take equity until she spent
four to six hours with the founder
because she's like I actually want to
assess that this works for me too and
that I want to work with you and so even
though it's it's counterintuitive to
give away your time for free it's best
for everybody involved exactly but and
it's never for free there's always a
benefit yeah there there's always an
intrinsic or a like there there's always
a benefit to that it's even better said
yep okay Caitlyn uh we'd love to hear
any like top of your head potent burning
experiences events things in your past
that have helped you tremendously as far
as learnings good bad or ugly that
helped you get where you are oh there
are so many of those there there's one
story this one comes up for me so often
just as like a such a pivotal moment for
me um Ed KML president of of Pixar um at
the time when I had worked there uh when
I when I very first started uh he and I
had a conversation around my career and
my development because I started at
Pixar as an executive assistant and that
was a deviation from what I had done
previously and it was not necessarily
what I wanted to do going forward
although I love that work you know it
was a h it was a total hallway
conversation and he said to me Caitlyn
it takes us five years here to make a
film if you still don't know what you
want to do when you grow up after five
years come and let me know because I
will have failed you um and I quit on
almost exactly my 5-year anniversary and
it was not because Ed had failed me it
was because he had given me so much that
organization had given me so much and I
wanted to take that and and build on it
in a new chapter of my career in a new
in a new industry and so that was a
really pivotal moment um and I think
that that set the groundwork for me for
the conversation that we had earlier
around knowing when to leap and so I
left that company when I was the
happiest but because Ed had given me a a
he time boxed it for me on
accident um and so I was very cognizant
and so as I took on different roles
within the organization I I worked in so
many different parts of the studio that
when I got to the end I was like do I
know what I want to do when I grow up
and the answer was no but it wasn't
because I was unhappy it was because I
was developing and I was growing and I
wanted to go do that elsewhere and so I
think that he really set me up for that
um being just aware and being able to
time box things for myself to make sure
that I was listening to uh my needs as
and you know as a someone growing a
career and not knowing what I wanted to
do and I say to this day I still don't
know what I want to do I love what I'm
doing and I don't know what I want to do
when I grow up um and I think that's a
beautiful place to be um so that's the
one that comes top of Mind love it thank
you yeah and I um I feel the exact same
way like everyone says like oh it seems
like you have it figured out and I'm
like I have nothing figured out and it
turns out like the smartest people when
you talk to them they're all like yeah
I'm just on this crazy Journey that's
called life and I just follow where the
the path takes me perhaps that's the
right answer Kaylin on that note um
thank you so much for joining us we've
had an absolute blast learning from you
and our audience is going to love the
show thank you for the time ditto thank
you so much Kaitlin oh I'm so grateful
for being invited on like I said I'm a
big fan of the show um and a big fan of
the audience so I it is my pleasure to
join you thank you so much for having me
