world of HR prior to what 15 years ago
 
world of HR prior to what 15 years ago
was so Antiquated and it was so not a
 
was so Antiquated and it was so not a
destination career it was not sexy it

go into it necessarily and there there
are special Souls who looked at that and
 
are special Souls who looked at that and
said yes that's for me and bless them um
 
said yes that's for me and bless them um

on accident because it was they were
 
on accident because it was they were
naturally drawn to or they were in an
 
naturally drawn to or they were in an
organization where people were coming to
 
organization where people were coming to
them people were confiding in them and
 
them people were confiding in them and
so it really was a community role an
 
so it really was a community role an
internal Community role and and the
 
internal Community role and and the
people who be who eventually transferred
 
people who be who eventually transferred
into the industry myself included were
 
into the industry myself included were
the ones who said gosh I think that
 
the ones who said gosh I think that
there is a pattern here I think that
 
there is a pattern here I think that
there's a trend here or there is a there
 
there's a trend here or there is a there
is a process here that is missing that I
 
is a process here that is missing that I
can I can see and I can see clear as day
 
can I can see and I can see clear as day
and then you go and you find the
 
and then you go and you find the
internal resources to build and then the
 
internal resources to build and then the
next thing you know you wake up in a
 
next thing you know you wake up in a
boardroom meeting and you're like oh I'm
 
boardroom meeting and you're like oh I'm
the HR person how did that happen um and
 
the HR person how did that happen um and
that's what happened to me uh so prior
 
that's what happened to me uh so prior
to getting into the world of tech and
 
to getting into the world of tech and
the world of HR I was um at Pixar
 
the world of HR I was um at Pixar
Animation Studios where I never held an
 
Animation Studios where I never held an
HR position um but what I like to say is
 
HR position um but what I like to say is
I was a client and a very happy client
 
I was a client and a very happy client
of uh the HR and people function at
 
of uh the HR and people function at
Pixar and I really credit that team with
 
Pixar and I really credit that team with
teaching me so much about what great HR
 
teaching me so much about what great HR
looks like because prior to that
 
looks like because prior to that
experience I worked in a number of
 
experience I worked in a number of
different Industries uh with a lot of
 
different Industries uh with a lot of
different types of cultures and I was
 
different types of cultures and I was
not necessarily a happy customer so
 
not necessarily a happy customer so
seeing it done really right and really
 
seeing it done really right and really
well um was was fascinating to me and so
 
well um was was fascinating to me and so
when I eventually left the studio and I
 
when I eventually left the studio and I
did move into Tech it was it was an
 
did move into Tech it was it was an
opportunity to take all of the
 
opportunity to take all of the
incredible things that I learned there
 
incredible things that I learned there
as a customer to say gosh I love the way
 
as a customer to say gosh I love the way
they built out their Learning and
 
they built out their Learning and
Development system again this is before
 
Development system again this is before
Learning and Development was something
 
Learning and Development was something
that was in you know that we were
 
that was in you know that we were
talking about in other types of
 
talking about in other types of
organizations but Pixar was so well
 
organizations but Pixar was so well
suited to be a Pioneer in many of these
 
suited to be a Pioneer in many of these
spaces because they were such a creative
 
spaces because they were such a creative
industry and they really a big part of
 
industry and they really a big part of
their their culture and their value set
 
their their culture and their value set
was building outside of the system right
 
was building outside of the system right
and so I was able to say you know
 
and so I was able to say you know
looking at the Pixar University model
 
looking at the Pixar University model
for example they didn't call it Learning
 
for example they didn't call it Learning
and Development it was the Pixar
 
and Development it was the Pixar
University and it's funny because it's
 
University and it's funny because it's
called pu and so you'd be like Oh I'm
 
called pu and so you'd be like Oh I'm
going to my pu class and the beauty of
 
going to my pu class and the beauty of
that program was they allowed anybody in
 
that program was they allowed anybody in
the studio regardless of your role your
 
the studio regardless of your role your
title your tenure your salary anything
 
title your tenure your salary anything
could attend any Course and there were

develop a deep relationships and move
the business forward and unpack and and
 
the business forward and unpack and and
discover creative ideas that could then
 
discover creative ideas that could then
be put into the film or put into a part
 
be put into the film or put into a part
of the process from all different parts
 
of the process from all different parts
of the organization and so for me that
 
of the organization and so for me that
was not we need to have a Learning and
 
was not we need to have a Learning and
Development uh system it was how do we
 
Development uh system it was how do we
live the value great ideas come from
 
live the value great ideas come from
anywhere and so I was like oh that's one
 
anywhere and so I was like oh that's one
example of like you are doing this so
 
example of like you are doing this so
right and I benefited from that from a
 
right and I benefited from that from a
growth and development standpoint I
 
growth and development standpoint I
learned so much then I was able to
 
learned so much then I was able to
create internal opportunities for myself
 
create internal opportunities for myself
to try things and do things and build
 
to try things and do things and build
relationships with people that I
 
relationships with people that I
otherwise would have never had that
 
otherwise would have never had that

for me and it's not serving me anymore
 
for me and it's not serving me anymore
but I love so much about this part that
 
but I love so much about this part that
I that I'll hang on and and so I think
 
I that I'll hang on and and so I think
it's a about there there are two things
 
it's a about there there are two things
for me that have helped those
 
for me that have helped those
transitions be successful one is trying
 
transitions be successful one is trying
to do my best to be self-aware about my
 
to do my best to be self-aware about my
needs and and where where my needs are
 
needs and and where where my needs are
being met and so in the example of you
 
being met and so in the example of you
know I was I was starting to advise for
 
know I was I was starting to advise for
initialized Capital and I found myself
 
initialized Capital and I found myself
drifting more towards thinking about
 
drifting more towards thinking about
those companies and those relationships
 
those companies and those relationships
I was like that's a sign so when it
 
I was like that's a sign so when it
became more than just a oh this is a
 
became more than just a oh this is a
lovely distraction for you know a half
 
lovely distraction for you know a half
hour a week to I really want to go
 
hour a week to I really want to go
deeper with that person or I I I want to
 
deeper with that person or I I I want to
take two or three calls this week so
 
take two or three calls this week so
that was an indicator for me that
 
that was an indicator for me that
something was shifting in myself um and
 
something was shifting in myself um and
then the other part was really being
 
then the other part was really being
able to have a great dialogue with your
 
able to have a great dialogue with your
leader right your with the person that
 
leader right your with the person that
that you are working and serving within

again business out comes I want the best
 
again business out comes I want the best
person leading this um and so those are
 
person leading this um and so those are
two things that have helped me identify
 
two things that have helped me identify
like when to to LEAP from the top of the

roller coaster as opposed to fall off at
 
roller coaster as opposed to fall off at
the bottom I can go and I can go
