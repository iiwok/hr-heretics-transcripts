what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today we
are back for part two with head of all
things data Peter Walker from CA welcome
back my friend great to be back guys
love a repeat invitation means something
must have gone well the first time yes
good to see see you all right so we're
going to get into Venture back to
everything today and I want to first
talk about hiring the market still seems
brutal what are you seeing in the card
of data yeah I mean I wish I had a
different adjective to put on it than
brutal but I think you probably nailed
it unfortunately you know we're looking
at number of new hires you know month
over month on CA so give you some
context in January of 2022 the
Collective carda companies so that's
 
single month in January 2022 this past
January 2024 they hired
 
think it's starting to pick up a little
bit post the summer although we don't
have great data to prove that yet but
basically what that means is the you
know we all we read all the headlines
about layoffs and departures and things
effectively like net head count on the
platform is flat since the start of 2023
which is a very very different place
than we were in in 20 and 2021 obviously
but also very different from 2017 2018
 
growth in net headcount so Founders are
just scrutinizing every single hire very
closely yep our teams actually running
leaner like that's been the the thing I
keep hearing from board members and and
Founders which is just like we are
operating as lean as we possibly can is
that just a sound bite or do you have
data that shows that it's actually
reality I have data but I also have a
question about our own data which I
can't really answer which is so to take
your the first part answer from us is
yes take a series a company the a series
a company that raised their series a in
 
full-time Equity holding employees in
the first half of 2024
series a companies were about 16
employees so from 20 to 16 not it's a
pretty solid drop when you consider the
percentage change there and I think it's
actually going to continue to get a
little bit smaller what I don't know is
are they supplementing that headcount
with fractional Consulting offshoring
non-equity holding employees things that
I can't see in our data my instinct is
that they are to some degree but I would
expect that most of the time they're not
they're not really bullshitting you like
they are running leaner than they used
to yep what about level of role so Kelly
and I have a hypothesis that companies
are are like trimming the fat from this
col like senior manager to senior
director level like these people who
were only managing people before and now
like companies given that they are
running leaner the expectation is is you
have to be able to operate at 70,000 ft
and in the dirt so are you seeing
anything in the data that's saying like
that's the the section of the
organization that's being cut I mean yes
and no look the the most likely people
to be laid off in any layoff according
to our data are the newest people so
regardless of level new is the biggest
criteria is the highest correlated
criteria than um than level although I
will say there obviously sub
distinctions you know if you're a VP
that were just hired you're still more
likely to stay on than if you're an inry
folk that was just hired beyond that I
think that there there certainly has
been a bit of a hollowing out we see it
more on the hiring side so if you look
at of those hires that are still
happening the whatever 30,000 or so in
January something like if those hires
from had been hired in 2020 you'd expect
probably about 50% of them to be ic's
another 40% of them to be managers and
then the last 10% to be you know execs
in recent years that's more tilted more
heavily towards ic's and early managers
and less heavily towards call IT
director and above so is that part of
the company being hollowed
out I think to some degree yes and
certainly when we talk to folks there is
this renewed emphasis on you there's no
like we're not hiring you so that you
can set a strategy and hire a bunch more
people and and not actually contribute
day to-day to the work um especially at
series a series B places I don't think
it's been like hugely dramatic I think
every layoff is different but in
aggregate I do think that's a reasonable
take yeah on the tenure correlation
Peter it's interesting maybe I'm I'm
bringing out my HR semantics here but
you mentioned early on early 10e people
is the biggest criteria and in my years
of doing a ton of riffs not a ton but a
lot of riffs we've never once to look at
tenure as a a key decision criteria of
whether to keepy
or cut someone is did you mean criteria
in that way or is it just happened to
see that's the correlation your data is
early tenure you know I don't know
whether or not I mean I'll take your
word for it that HR folks are not
looking at tenure as a you know input to
the layoff calculations or the Riff
calculations I just know that the you
know empirically if you look at the data
for instance on 10e across startup
companies about something like half of
all startup employees will depart within
three years of joining so and in the
recent years those joiners have been
much more likely to have left and most
of that is through layoffs so the the is
it are they actively like using that as
the input criteria probably not but I
don't know I mean you would you would be
better than me in tell like what are the
input criteria that's often used is it
you're trying to get to a specific Cash
number number maybe I'm not exactly sure
how it works interesting yeah okay I I
maybe some HR folks use it as a criteria
I I never have but I just there's a term
for it there's a term for it's called
last in first out and I think part of
the reason why Kelly that we see it is
because we have more data on employees
with tenure so when we're doing a layoff
right we weren't expecting to do it when
we hired these people we hired these
people now they're in the building and
we're looking at who do we have more
confidence in with the team moving
forward and I think that's that's where
that term comes from it also it it's
advice I'm familiar with it I just
wanted to clarify what Peter was talking
about when he said criteria but and I
was talking to a company this morning
Peter about fractional Etc and they were
supplementing half their team with with
contractors Etc
so that's good and my question for you
is that would be really cool to see
across the port you know your your
companies do you all have plans to to
tackle that at some point or is it just
well if if those employees are being
granted Equity then we could but my
instinct is that there's a lot of
non-equity agreements that are happening
that we just don't see so card is a
fantastic resource for this sort of
hiring layouts but we are almost always
tracking employees that have some sort
of equity ownership so if you don't have
Equity ownership it's kind of tough for
us to see where you fit and that's but I
I kind of I'm not surprised that you
heard that like that's kind of what I'd
been assuming was happening there's
there's the other side of the story
which is both true and also way
overplayed of people like we've
automated entire apartments with with AI
like who needs customer success anymore
all that kind of stuff I think that's
mostly for now now will that
will that same will I have that same
opinion in a year and a half or two
years when people have really been able
to automate functions a little bit more
cleanly maybe not but I think that most
of it is a reaction to the fundraising
Market as opposed to some like long-term
strategy visava I yep I want to go back
to the the last in first out point one I
I get a lot of friends right now who are
unhappy with their roles with their jobs
with their managers something like and
and they'll always come to me and ask
for me ADV advice and one of the things
I tell them is be careful about the
devil that you don't know especially in
today's market because of the and that's
really interesting data now that I can
point them to because it's it's a
dangerous time like if you do have job
security I'm somebody who's like always
I'm I'm very risk tolerant I'm trying to
take more risk in my life now seems like
a scary time to do that given that there
is so much turmoil in the Venture
markets and so I I want to like actually
transition into that and to talk about
the fund performance data that you guys
have recently put out Nolan actually
before we jump there the point you just
made is reflected in our data around
voluntary versus involuntary departures
which is the nice way of saying did you
leave by choice or did you get laid off
the people who are leaving Choice it's
higher than the people that are getting
laid off thankfully now but it's not
that much higher the gap between those
two types of people is actually much
smaller than it was in say 2019 in 2019
it was like three people left for every
one that got fired now it's more like
not 50/50 but closer and it's I think
some of that is exactly what you're
saying people who are dissatisfied with
their current gigs are looking over the
market and saying I'm I just don't want
to risk it right now for an uncertain
job that may I may end up being on The
Chopping Buck for faster than I expect
yep they somebody just coined this term
the big stay right we had the great
resignation and now it's and now it's
the big
stay hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
Real Talk most Talent leaders haven't
yet cracked how to leverage AI for
Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a time
saer because perfect notes means perfect
data for every candidate in every
pipeline hiring teams can make confident
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
quora and check out medavie head over to
metav view. a/ Heretics to talk to one
of metav VI's product experts or get
started for free you'll be uppr running
an AI enabled in
minutes I I I do want to talk about this
fun performance thing because it it ties
into what we're talking about here so
one of the things I think people don't
understand about the Venture ecosystem
is that it's driven by investor returns
such that if an invest an invest if
investors don't make money they won't
invest further and the ecosystem will
suffer so what are you guys seeing right
now in terms of fund performance yeah so
I think it's actually sometimes useful
for employees at startups to take a step
back and think about the big picture
like this right I am part of an
ecosystem that ecosystem has many
different nodes and players in it one of
those nodes one of the most important
ones is Venture capitalists themselves
where are they
investing right now we did a big report
on 1,00 Venture funds that use Carta as
their fund admin I think it's the
biggest such data set for emerging
managers anywhere in the world so those
are managers that are running funds call
it less than100 million which are
disproportionately likely as you can
imagine to invest into companies that
are raising small rounds so seed series
a etc so this is a direct impact on
those kind of companies which has a
direct impact on the employees that
those companies hire right now fund
performance is not doing so high as you
can imagine it's very closely it has to
be in some ways a reflection of the
broader startup ecosystem so as
valuations for portfolio companies go
down the valuation of the fund the tvpi
of the fund also declines we've been
seeing that quarter over quarter since
you know the start of 2020
what's interesting is that the timelines
in these things matter very deeply and
they're very different if you're a
startup and you can't fund raise well
you have about 18 to two 18 months to
two years to figure it out if you're a
venture fund and you envisioning being
unable to fund raise in the future
you're still deploying that first fund
for three to five years and then you're
probably at that fund that fund is in
existence for another 15 years sometimes
so it is a
it's a the feedback loop for actual VCS
is much slower than it is for Founders
and that causes problems because as you
mentioned a lot of LPS the people invest
into these VCS they're looking around
Venture and they're saying I haven't
gotten the returns that I was expecting
there's no recycled Capital you know if
I'm Stanford endowment sure no problem I
just keep investing the way that I have
been if I'm a high net worth individual
who just started investing into Venture
funds as an LP maybe I do something else
with my money interest rates are now
much higher you know there's there's a
whole other like Universe of economic
things I could do and that puts a lot of
these emerging fund managers at risk and
the ecosystem right like this is this is
the thing that I don't think people are
fully comprehending which is if
companies aren't doing well or if
they're not getting to liquidity
moments and investors are losing money
they're going to stop investing into the
space yep and Venture is a huge driver
of employment like how many employees do
you track through Carta over a million a
million employees yeah oh my God this is
a huge portion of our economy that I
don't think is like people are like
actually understanding so I want to talk
about like the liquidity moments too
what are you seeing in terms of timeline
to liquidity and specifically what I
mean is mmaa and IPO because that's when
investors get their money back yeah so
it takes takes forever I mean it's it's
like a very long time between those two
things m&amp;a on one side most of the exits
that happen to venture pack companies
are of the acquisition type not IPO as
you can imagine very very few companies
actually end up making it to the
NASDAQ within m&amp;a we've actually seen
that it is fairly strong right now it's
not going down it's rising quarter over
quarter something like 150 companies or
so get acquired off of Carta every
quarter
so you know that's a pretty decent
number of companies different decent
chunk of things what what was it like a
year ago has it do you have at the top
of your head what what's gone up so like
Q3 to Q3 a year ago was like 130 this
year it's probably like 163 so solid
increase in number of companies the
question is what economic value is being
generated through those Acquisitions
down to the cap table and that's
something that's actually pretty
difficult oddly for us to see because
company basically leaves Carta
immediately before they are actually
acquired so it's a little difficult to
tell you know some of those are just
going to be Aqua hires some of those are
going to be basically your startup shut
down in name or in basically in practice
but a name you got bought so like it's
not as though all of those Acquisitions
are actually resulting in tons of cash
for the founder or tons of cash for the
employees I think actually most of them
today are probably less remunerative to
those stakeholders than they would have
been in the past and then the IPOs right
now in our data it's something like 12
years to IPO from inception and that's
for the companies that obviously IPO
which is very very very few companies
and this year has the lowest number of
tech IPOs in the last decade I think
it's it's super low so like to noan to
your point there's a lot of capital that
is contained has been invested into
these companies and invest are sort of
uh starting to really get nervous about
when they're going to make any money off
of these names yeah and new investors to
your point about the ecosystem noan new
investors might be very hesitant to even
jump in the game considering now like to
Hill is steeper and you're hiking hiking
for a lot longer so it's like a double
whammy yeah and what Peter was just
talking about too with so like emerging
fund managers so right so if you go back
to 2018 to like
 
starting a new fund and you know like
they're just like starting to write
checks and that's you know that actually
drove a lot of the influx of capital
into the ecosystem Peter it doesn't seem
like these funds are doing well number
one and then number two it doesn't feel
like if those funds are doing well those
people are going to be able to raise
additional funds is that what you're
seeing so far in the data do you guys
have enough data to actually look at
that we haven't really looked at fun
shutdown but you know to pull a pull a
credible voice out of The Ether here
Josh at Lux Capital Josh Wolf at Lux
Capital had this theory that he's think
 
going to shut down within the next three
to five years meaning they will no
longer be VCS and they will be doing
something else with their time I think
that's a little pessimistic but not a
lot pessimistic there's definitely going
to be a rotation out of many of those
funds and if they raised fund one or
fund two in the boom times will they be
ble to raise their second or third fund
now probably not now that sounds pretty
bad I I think in taking my employee at a
startup hat off and just like
macroanalysis
perspective what we were doing in 2020
and 2021 was completely unsustainable so
in some ways this is going back towards
ecosystem health I do think that when we
talk about ecosystem Health we tend to
leave off the messiness that that
entails Visa V layoffs people losing
their jobs people not getting startup
jobs in the first place fewer companies
being started Etc there's a question of
the Eternal question around Venture
which is how many companies at any one
time are actually worthy of venture
capital because it's a very unique
should be a fairly small segment of all
quote unquote startups in a given
ecosystem maybe we got over our skis and
we were funding too many of them that's
that's cold comfort for employees who
are working at some of them now I think
it's probably true but I don't know what
the right level of startup creation is
for say the next five years yeah that's
really interesting okay so let's let's
pivot a little bit to talk about
employee
compensation last time on the show you
had told us cash had remained about flat
but Equity was down what's going on with
employee comp right now honestly the
story remains pretty similar which in
some ways is good so Equity comp for
instance has St stopped falling which is
great to see it's kind of leveled off
about a third lower than it was in 2022
and you know salaries picked up they
gained about I don't know a quarter or a
half a percent over the last six months
or so so flat to slightly up on salaries
and then flat for Equity thankfully as
opposed to like another Giant Drop from
where it was in 2022 Peter do you guys
do you all have data on global
differences with Equity right I'm used
to no no 's been shifting their ranges
Etc based on you know the Glo the global
nature of things and I'm wondering if
that's that's picked up as a result of
of potentially lowering ranges in
different GEOS we have some data on
International Equity packages they tend
to at a bit of a slower Pace follow the
US in terms of the trends we don't have
I don't want to speak too broadly
because the density of the data is
obviously much less in non- US countries
but we do see a kind of a similar thing
the other difference is of course equity
in different countries functions very
differently in terms of like the tax
advantages Etc it's not just like isos
everywhere so some of those distinctions
may be obviated by the way that the
equity is being granted yeah got you
talk to me about company
valuations so we obviously saw a huge
spike in valuations you know during the
call it like 2017 to 2022
vintage what's going on now and how do
those valuations relate to what we've
seen historically they're
honestly the valuations at the earliest
stages seed and series a are pretty damn
High still they're actually maybe
expensive in my view you know a seed
Stage Company being valued at $14
million pre money that's basically where
they were at the height in 2021 now the
number of companies actually achieving
those valuations is much less so about
half uh number of new rounds but like
early stage startups are being valued
especially if you're AI in a very robust
way maybe a little bit less taking into
account the effects of inflation on
those dollars but but it's still like
quite expensive later stage has fallen
quite a bit so the the valuation of your
average series D company is much lower
than it used to be so if you just you
know one of the stats we put out
recently was around unicorns which is
any company valued over a billion
dollars in 2021 we saw 331 new unicorns
that use Carta in 2024 through the first
half we've seen 40 so not a lot of
companies getting billion dollar
valuations these days in some ways if
you're an employee like this isn't good
but it is clarifying in that if your
company is receiving a billion dollar
valuation today it probably has much
better underlying metrics than the some
of the unicorns that were minted in 2021
just based on how difficult fundraising
is totally and of the
 
happen to know how many of those are
left standing as
unicorns quite a few are I mean almost
you know the the vast majority are still
quote unquote unicorns some of that is
because a lot of them just haven't
raised again since then haven't raised
so on paper they are still yeah on paper
their unicorns are they you know what's
I don't know what the best term is their
stale unicorns perhaps is a way to
describe them I imagine that something
eventually something like half of them
will end up taking down rounds yes and
on that note I was really curious and if
you all track this to what you're seeing
with secondary markets and tender offers
yeah so tender offers there are two
kinds of I guess secondaries that matter
here one we call sort of bilateral
transactions which is just individual
people getting together and trying to
affect secondaries cter doesn't do that
but we can see when it happens around
around a cap table the other is tender
offers which is company sponsored events
so you know people might be familiar
with say stripe doing this where they
say look we're not going to go public
but we want to give our employees some
liquidity so what we're going to do is
we're going to host a tender offer
secondary event where our employees can
sell a portion of their stock and
receive liquidity without us having to
go
public those are trending up from a low
base of 2023 when there was very little
activity trending up they kind of seem
to follow the late stage valuations as
late stage valuations get higher you
know secondaries pop up a little bit
more and secondaries are very
concentrated in series C and D and
Beyond you know you don't have a ton of
secondary transactions in a series a
company so those are happening the
buyers and sellers are still generally a
little bit further apart than you would
have expected you know in normal times
but it's a it's a route out it's just
candidly like none of these liquidity
mechanisms make up for the lack of IPOs
IPOs are their own sort of gigantic
events that really spur recycling
throughout the Venture ecosystem so yeah
there's ways to get around some of this
but we won't really be healthy until
companies start iping do you have a
sense as to why they're not like I'm
looking at the S&amp;P right now and it
appears to be ripping and it's you know
it feels like if you just invested in
the S&amp;P 500 Index you'd be doing quite
well over the last couple of years but I
keep hearing IPO markets are closed like
where is the dissonance what am I not
understanding my instinct is there are
two reasons for this so one if you like
Subs segment that S&amp;P like how much of
that growth is actually concentrated in
seven names and really if you're just
talking about the broader swath of SAS
companies they haven't actually been
performing that well in the public
markets the second reason is that some
of the best names that you would expect
to IPO don't need to so if you're stripe
why IPO
what's the point you have unlimited
Capital here in the private markets you
can affect those tender offers so that
your employees stay liquid and respons
or you know are excited about the
company and you avoid a bunch of
oversight what's wrong with that so I
think for the biggest possible names IPO
is actually in some ways just taking on
a regulatory burden that you may not
need to do that doesn't apply to very
many companies but it applies to the
most well-known companies and that's
kind of you know as you think about a
regulatory challenge making going public
more attractive to the best names would
be something that I think probably
deserves some look damn I had never
considered that so you're basically
saying if you're
stripe and you're able to get liquidity
to your employees you're able to get
liquidity to your early investors
because there's demand in the private
markets for your Equity what is your
incentive
to go
IPO I had never considered that but I'm
I'm actually like struggling right now
to figure out what that incentive would
be and to others like stripe that are in
the similar positions why did they go
IPO best thing I can think of is people
you know have dreams of seeing their
name on The Well access to Capital is
the is the primary argument but the best
names actually don't struggle to have
access to Capital and they've you know
over the last few years have raised a
 ton of money so like their coffers
are probably already full and we're
entering an era of AI to where
theoretically they can get more
operational leverage such that they
won't be spending as much as they had
been spending in the years's past damn I
had never thought about that I think
it's a to be clear this is a very elite
problem right like there are not that
many companies for whom the private
Capital markets could suffice forever or
that have that much interests so in some
ways the the need to IPO would maybe be
stronger in that like second tier of
late stage firms but yeah I mean I think
part of this is just the gigantic growth
of private Capital over the last 10
years where you know open AI is funding
a what size billion dollar round with
you know a bunch of people you have to
have write a 200 100 billion plus
rumored $250 million check to get in the
door like the fact that that kind of
capitals available to them as a private
company is leagues beyond what would
have happened 10 or 15 years ago so in
some ways this is a story of just the
growth of private markets as a whole and
you know eventually you run into this
problem where the kind of the point of
the public market is that retail
investors can take part in the growth of
some of these tech
companies that's I think that's
important for us as a country I think it
individually kind of like makes it hard
to make that case to some Founders who
are like why why would I do that man
that's so interesting okay I want to go
back to a comment made around the the
seed data that you're seeing so you said
about half of the number of you're
seeing half the number of new rounds as
you did like during Peak what does that
data look like for the rest of like
series a and Beyond similarly down I
think it's actually a little bit down
further the closer that you are to IPO
so the the downturn hit the closest to
IPO companies fastest in terms of new
rounds total raised Etc as people kind
of reset their
expectations that you know it's the
again the Su of this is just a question
of what is normal is it useful to
compare ourselves to 2021 or was that
the sugar high and actually where we are
right now is quote unquote more normal
even though it feels much more difficult
obviously if you're using that Peak as a
reference point I think there's actually
probably some legitimacy in that it's
not just investors trying to calm
Founders down like this is a more normal
ecosystem outside of some AI bubble
infrastructure stuff so it's it's just a
question of whether or not those rounds
will continue to pick back up and some
of that is outside the control of all
participants in this ecosystem I'm
thinking specifically here of the FED
like fed if you if you plot Venture
rounds against the FED interest rate
like the correlation is not one to one
but it's pretty inversely correlated so
hey if 50 basis points cut what does
that mean for Venture in 2025 I don't
think it means anything bad for Venture
in 2025 we put it that way Peter I'm
curious how the sugar high of 21 as you
put it correlates to what I felt was a
sugar high when I was in a CPO role in
 
pretty big sugar high I just haven't
really compared the two anything on top
of your head between those eras our data
isn't amazing back to 2014 or 2008 so I
don't have great numbers here when I I I
think one of the distinctions between
those two periods was well twofold one
and 2021 were basically at the end of 10
years of very very very low interest
rates so like the accumulated Capital
expansion there is very high and the
second is of course the pandemic which I
think it's underrated after the initial
scare of April 2020 what the pandemic
did to Venture where I'm not sure if it
was because everyone was at home and
it's all you could do or what but like
crypto Venture things went Bonkers over
those 18 months I mean there were
multiple deals that you know you would
probably the participants now would look
back and say the moment I signed that I
knew that was overvalued by 300% right
and it's just kind of like you get
caught up in a wave so I and the the
pandemic had a whole host of other more
significant impacts obviously on health
and everything else but for Venture I
think it was like a before and after
sort of moment yeah it it feels like
we're in a moment of resetting
expectations as to what like especially
for employees about like what working in
Venture actually is and the stuff that
you're describing right now is is
actually leading me to a hypothesis but
I want to actually first ask about
shutdowns you said you know basically
half of the rounds are getting done
roughly that we saw during Peak zer
we're seeing an uptick in m&amp;a which may
be attributed to either companies
shutting down or Aqua hire sorts of
things which is kind of what I'm hearing
and what my belief is what's going on
with company shutdowns right now they're
definitely up they're Rising 2024 the
first half of 20124 more companies shut
down on CA than we'd ever seen in six
months now that sounds bad and it isn't
good but it also has to be taken
relative to the total you know data set
size that Carter has access to so more
companies have joined CA and more
companies got funded and so therefore we
would expect shutdowns to be generally
higher if unless the percentage of
startups that actually make it out would
increase and there's really no reason
why you would think that so if nine out
of 10 startups are going to shut down
then that 90% shutdown is going to
happen if it happens on a bigger data
set then obviously the the absolute
numbers are going to be higher I do
think you're at a very acute point in
shutdowns though where we are about two
two and a half years past the real
downturn beginning in early 22 and maybe
it really didn't take hold in Venture
and people weren't really hipped to it
until mid 2022 so two years on that's a
pretty interesting Mark right companies
would have had to do one of three things
one change their business keep
fundraising like make it out two change
their business but Venture investors are
no longer that interested in them or
maybe their business doesn't work with
high interest rates and then you have to
bridge or extend or struggle along or
three try to do that pay
fail and then shut down it takes a while
to do those pivots and do that trial so
I'm not surprised that more of those say
unicorns haven't shut down yet they have
one they had a lot of capital on the
books and two they had some time to make
these changes I think the rubber hits
the road in the next year where it's
like either you made the changes and
you're going to continue as this kind of
business or you're looking for a path
out maybe that's an acquisition or maybe
you have to shut down shop so it kind of
feels like we're over the biggest hump
of this but we we still have more after
effects to experience yeah I do feel
like the Heat's getting turned up in the
kitchen on kind of like what's it going
to be you know tender sex tender
secondary IPO m&amp;a raise some of that
heat is coming from younger companies
right so like investors don't have to
keep investing in the companies they've
already invested in they can they can if
you're a series a investor you can say
look you raised your seed round in 2021
you're growing 40% a year here's this
company that raised their seed round 8
months ago they're growing 300% a year
it's just a different sort of thing you
have to compete with all of the younger
cohorts that didn't have this valuation
overhang to put on their cap tables
they're coming up clean and that's hard
totally yeah it is and I know you know
this shows about the data and all the
data you swim in Peter and I love it but
anecdotally a lot of employees in these
companies are also starting to ask what
are we doing here what's it going to be
and I feel like that pressure is getting
turned up as well I totally agree with
you Kelly and this this kind of goes to
my hypothesis that I was referring to
earlier so if you have more
shutdowns fewer new rounds you know a
little bit more m&amp;a activity which is
basically attributed potentially to Aqua
hires it seems to me that the thing that
we're going to see next is this like
Talent consolidation
phase such that the the biggest and best
companies are going to to continue to
acquire great talent because it felt
like you know call it during the last 10
to 12 years Talent started to get
distributed and there was this distrib
you know great talent was kind of going
everywhere I had friends at all
different sorts of Industries and
sectors but now given that you have and
the other piece is less liquidity right
so what you just mentioned Kelly if I'm
an employee and I have my pick of the
litter one of the things I'm starting to
think about is like who can actually
like Get My Equity worth real dollars
yes
and so when you think it it just feels
like the rich are going to get richer
during this next phase I think that's I
think that's a completely reasonable
hypothesis of the world what it mandates
though is that the elite are going to
hire in a way that they used to whereas
maybe they won't my instinct candidly is
to be like look if fundraising is going
well and if fundraising in a general
pops back hiring will pick up I don't
know if we as human beings are able to
be Capital efficient when some external
force is enforcing us to right like
people will probably start throwing
headcount at problems again if
fundraising got materially easier I I
think I deeply believe that we haven't
solved our ability to like get into
bubbles however I agree with you that I
I think Talent consolidation is is one
aspect of this that's probably going to
happen over the next one to two years
and then it's really incumbent upon the
employee to say
yeah where is My Equity likely to be
worth something and then also which
companies are thinking strategically
about liquidity and how are they
thinking about liquidity I mean we've
seen some models and they have a story
for it yeah we've seen some models
lately that popped up that are different
like open AI does not have standard isos
right so there are ways in which you
could build equity that doesn't exactly
look like ownership does today but
offers the employee enhanced chances for
liquidity as a employee benefit I know
that I would be looking for that as an
employee I hope that if you're in the
you know enviable position of being
sought after by multiple startups that's
one of the things that you're asking and
crypto as well that's a different model
which is interesting with a token model
and more more frequent to both of your
points and I just talked to someone this
morning I also think we're probably
going to see talent flocking to
different Industries than before do you
know what I mean crypto security AI life
sciences right these industries
where they're they're doing well to your
point around companies that can get them
liquidity Etc you know I'll speak for
myself I mean I've been Enterprise SAS
for a while it's like oh maybe you go
somewhere else like I think I think
you're going to see Talent more
Diversified outside of maybe where
they've lived the past 10 years yeah I
don't I mean I don't think SAS is going
away maybe it's changing pretty
significantly sure but there's also
a question around Venture Capital like
as the default pathway for a lot of
these startups never really should have
been the default pathway and honestly it
really never was except for we and we
and VCB startups are very good about
talking about ourselves so it kind of
feels that way if you're online but in
general you know there's a ton of
companies that are going to get started
look at the VC funding model and go H
not for us now what those companies do
to incentivize employees in terms of
ownership they can still do very inter
in things with Equity they just don't
have a lot of investors and maybe
they're growing at different rates than
your standard VC backed company but it's
a it's a cool and interesting time to
hey if I'm a Founder can I bootstrap
this to an amazing exit for me and for
my employees as opposed to for my
investors yep last question for me Peter
is around how much of the equity is
going back to the pool so let me just
like refresh we had this conversation
last time but when when you leave a
company and you have unvested options uh
that those options go back into the pool
but even for your vested options which
is where I want to focus the question
most companies have a 90day
posttermination exercise window which
means that you have 90 days to Shell out
a bunch of cash to ensure that the
options that you earned are still yours
long past those 90 days of the vested
options what's being returned to the
pool right now do you guys have data on
that we do so in this data set
you know we look at the percentage of
options that have been vested that were
exercised before their vesting period
expired so why would it why would that
period expire one because they've been
there for for 10 years which is very
very few people or two they left the
company either by choice or through
layoff so in that 90-day period
effectively what this chart is showing
is just in that 90-day period what
percent of f actually exercise their
equity and take full ownership of that
those shares right now that percentage
is like
 
returning to the pool at the peak in
 
drop is it's about half as much why is
that happening some of it is good
financial decision making by those
employees they're saying look I'm
getting laid off I don't believe in the
prospects of this company why would I
shell out cash right now for something I
don't believe in long term some of that
is probably an inability to come up with
enough cash to buy the options that want
and then the third thing is either a
lack of Education or a like a
misapprehension about where the company
is
going my instinct is that a lot of these
these decisions are being made by
employees and they're good financial
decisions there's obviously a portion of
it where I'm sure that they wish they
could exercise my only you know point on
all this and it's the same one that I'll
I've made before is just that 90 days is
a silly amount of time to have to make
this decision I know why it exists
please don't at me I get the tax
implications but I personally believe
it's too little amount of time so like
you know no and you know this at carda
our our vesting schedule is indexed to
how long we've been at the company so
you get more time if you stay longer I
think that's fair I think there's a lot
of ways to make this slightly more fair
to
employees why does the 90day exist I
thought it was just because it was
always that way it exists because it is
part of the requirements in order to use
an incentive stock op versus a
non-qualified stock option so it
actually over 90 days you can't have a
vesting period over 90 days and still
use the iso it converts into an NSO so
it has different taxk
implications that is like why does that
why is that a criteria no idea really
still something that you know Founders
and others can work around uh and it's
there's a there's I've heard the other
side of this debate which is look if you
for instance gave someone an infinite
exercise period there it's very
difficult for the company to plan
because they don't really know how much
of the pool is used and i' say well one
they they worked there they earned that
so yeah you allocated it anyway you gave
it out you did allocate it it's kind of
weird to be like I allocate this amount
of equity with the significant
expectation that most of that's coming
back to me like it's a little odd as a
model it's insane yeah but and I I do
sympathize with Founders here like yes
it is kind of difficult to manage your
pool there but 90 days ESP especially
especially if they got laid off and they
weren't planning on leaving if they're
planning on leaving maybe they have some
time to save up some cash if you just
get laid off and then you have 90 days
it's it's it's pretty ridiculous
honestly I have such strong feelings
about this as we know so yeah I think
all of us share the the same thoughts
Peter this was great where where can
people find you online you know I I'm
just lurking on LinkedIn mostly so
that's probably the best place to start
