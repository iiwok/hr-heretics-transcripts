of data yeah I mean I wish I had a
 
of data yeah I mean I wish I had a
different adjective to put on it than
 
different adjective to put on it than
brutal but I think you probably nailed
 
brutal but I think you probably nailed
it unfortunately you know we're looking
 
it unfortunately you know we're looking
at number of new hires you know month
 
at number of new hires you know month
over month on CA so give you some
 
over month on CA so give you some
context in January of 2022 the

Collective carda companies so that's
 
Collective carda companies so that's
 
single month in January 2022 this past
 
single month in January 2022 this past
January 2024 they hired
 
January 2024 they hired
 
think it's starting to pick up a little
 
think it's starting to pick up a little
bit post the summer although we don't
 
bit post the summer although we don't
have great data to prove that yet but
 
have great data to prove that yet but
basically what that means is the you
 
basically what that means is the you
know we all we read all the headlines
 
know we all we read all the headlines
about layoffs and departures and things
 
about layoffs and departures and things
effectively like net head count on the
 
effectively like net head count on the
platform is flat since the start of 2023
 
platform is flat since the start of 2023
which is a very very different place
 
which is a very very different place
than we were in in 20 and 2021 obviously
 
than we were in in 20 and 2021 obviously
but also very different from 2017 2018
 
but also very different from 2017 2018
 
growth in net headcount so Founders are
 
growth in net headcount so Founders are
just scrutinizing every single hire very
 
just scrutinizing every single hire very
closely yep our teams actually running
 
closely yep our teams actually running
leaner like that's been the the thing I
 
leaner like that's been the the thing I
keep hearing from board members and and
 
keep hearing from board members and and
Founders which is just like we are
 
Founders which is just like we are
operating as lean as we possibly can is
 
operating as lean as we possibly can is
that just a sound bite or do you have
 
that just a sound bite or do you have
data that shows that it's actually
 
data that shows that it's actually
reality I have data but I also have a
 
reality I have data but I also have a
question about our own data which I
 
question about our own data which I
can't really answer which is so to take
 
can't really answer which is so to take
your the first part answer from us is
 
your the first part answer from us is
yes take a series a company the a series
 
yes take a series a company the a series
a company that raised their series a in
 
a company that raised their series a in
 
full-time Equity holding employees in
 
full-time Equity holding employees in
the first half of 2024
 
the first half of 2024
series a companies were about 16
 
series a companies were about 16
employees so from 20 to 16 not it's a
 
employees so from 20 to 16 not it's a
pretty solid drop when you consider the
 
pretty solid drop when you consider the
percentage change there and I think it's
 
percentage change there and I think it's
actually going to continue to get a
 
actually going to continue to get a
little bit smaller what I don't know is
 
little bit smaller what I don't know is
are they supplementing that headcount
 
are they supplementing that headcount
with fractional Consulting offshoring
 
with fractional Consulting offshoring
non-equity holding employees things that
 
non-equity holding employees things that
I can't see in our data my instinct is
 
I can't see in our data my instinct is
that they are to some degree but I would
 
that they are to some degree but I would
expect that most of the time they're not
 
expect that most of the time they're not
they're not really bullshitting you like
 
they're not really bullshitting you like
they are running leaner than they used
 
they are running leaner than they used
to yep what about level of role so Kelly
 
to yep what about level of role so Kelly
and I have a hypothesis that companies
 
and I have a hypothesis that companies
are are like trimming the fat from this
 
are are like trimming the fat from this
col like senior manager to senior
 
col like senior manager to senior
director level like these people who
 
director level like these people who
were only managing people before and now
 
were only managing people before and now
like companies given that they are
 
like companies given that they are
running leaner the expectation is is you
 
running leaner the expectation is is you
have to be able to operate at 70,000 ft
 
have to be able to operate at 70,000 ft
and in the dirt so are you seeing
 
and in the dirt so are you seeing
anything in the data that's saying like
 
anything in the data that's saying like
that's the the section of the
 
that's the the section of the
organization that's being cut I mean yes
 
organization that's being cut I mean yes
and no look the the most likely people
 
and no look the the most likely people
to be laid off in any layoff according
 
to be laid off in any layoff according
to our data are the newest people so
 
to our data are the newest people so
regardless of level new is the biggest
 
regardless of level new is the biggest
criteria is the highest correlated
 
criteria is the highest correlated
criteria than um than level although I
 
criteria than um than level although I
will say there obviously sub
 
will say there obviously sub
distinctions you know if you're a VP
 
distinctions you know if you're a VP
that were just hired you're still more
 
that were just hired you're still more
likely to stay on than if you're an inry
 
likely to stay on than if you're an inry
folk that was just hired beyond that I
 
folk that was just hired beyond that I
think that there there certainly has
 
think that there there certainly has
been a bit of a hollowing out we see it
 
been a bit of a hollowing out we see it
more on the hiring side so if you look
 
more on the hiring side so if you look
at of those hires that are still
 
at of those hires that are still
happening the whatever 30,000 or so in
 
happening the whatever 30,000 or so in
January something like if those hires
 
January something like if those hires
from had been hired in 2020 you'd expect
 
from had been hired in 2020 you'd expect
probably about 50% of them to be ic's
 
probably about 50% of them to be ic's
another 40% of them to be managers and
 
another 40% of them to be managers and
then the last 10% to be you know execs
 
then the last 10% to be you know execs
in recent years that's more tilted more
 
in recent years that's more tilted more
heavily towards ic's and early managers
 
heavily towards ic's and early managers
and less heavily towards call IT
 
and less heavily towards call IT
director and above so is that part of
 
director and above so is that part of
the company being hollowed
 
the company being hollowed
out I think to some degree yes and
 
out I think to some degree yes and
certainly when we talk to folks there is
 
certainly when we talk to folks there is
this renewed emphasis on you there's no
 
this renewed emphasis on you there's no
like we're not hiring you so that you
 
like we're not hiring you so that you
can set a strategy and hire a bunch more
 
can set a strategy and hire a bunch more
people and and not actually contribute
 
people and and not actually contribute
day to-day to the work um especially at
 
day to-day to the work um especially at
series a series B places I don't think
 
series a series B places I don't think
it's been like hugely dramatic I think
 
it's been like hugely dramatic I think
every layoff is different but in
 
every layoff is different but in
aggregate I do think that's a reasonable
 
aggregate I do think that's a reasonable
take yeah on the tenure correlation
 
take yeah on the tenure correlation
Peter it's interesting maybe I'm I'm
 
Peter it's interesting maybe I'm I'm
bringing out my HR semantics here but
 
bringing out my HR semantics here but
you mentioned early on early 10e people
 
you mentioned early on early 10e people
is the biggest criteria and in my years
 
is the biggest criteria and in my years
of doing a ton of riffs not a ton but a
 
of doing a ton of riffs not a ton but a
lot of riffs we've never once to look at
 
lot of riffs we've never once to look at
tenure as a a key decision criteria of
 
tenure as a a key decision criteria of
whether to keepy
 
whether to keepy
or cut someone is did you mean criteria
 
or cut someone is did you mean criteria
in that way or is it just happened to
 
in that way or is it just happened to
see that's the correlation your data is
 
see that's the correlation your data is
early tenure you know I don't know
 
early tenure you know I don't know
whether or not I mean I'll take your
 
whether or not I mean I'll take your
word for it that HR folks are not
 
word for it that HR folks are not
looking at tenure as a you know input to
 
looking at tenure as a you know input to
the layoff calculations or the Riff
 
the layoff calculations or the Riff
calculations I just know that the you
 
calculations I just know that the you
know empirically if you look at the data
 
know empirically if you look at the data
for instance on 10e across startup
 
for instance on 10e across startup
companies about something like half of
 
companies about something like half of
all startup employees will depart within
 
all startup employees will depart within
three years of joining so and in the
 
three years of joining so and in the
recent years those joiners have been
 
recent years those joiners have been
much more likely to have left and most
 
much more likely to have left and most
of that is through layoffs so the the is
 
of that is through layoffs so the the is
it are they actively like using that as
 
it are they actively like using that as
the input criteria probably not but I
 
the input criteria probably not but I
don't know I mean you would you would be
 
don't know I mean you would you would be
better than me in tell like what are the
 
better than me in tell like what are the
input criteria that's often used is it
 
input criteria that's often used is it
you're trying to get to a specific Cash
 
you're trying to get to a specific Cash
number number maybe I'm not exactly sure
 
number number maybe I'm not exactly sure
how it works interesting yeah okay I I
 
how it works interesting yeah okay I I
maybe some HR folks use it as a criteria
 
maybe some HR folks use it as a criteria
I I never have but I just there's a term
 
I I never have but I just there's a term
for it there's a term for it's called
 
for it there's a term for it's called
last in first out and I think part of
 
last in first out and I think part of
the reason why Kelly that we see it is
 
the reason why Kelly that we see it is
because we have more data on employees
 
because we have more data on employees
with tenure so when we're doing a layoff
 
with tenure so when we're doing a layoff
right we weren't expecting to do it when
 
right we weren't expecting to do it when
we hired these people we hired these
 
we hired these people we hired these
people now they're in the building and
 
people now they're in the building and
we're looking at who do we have more
 
we're looking at who do we have more
confidence in with the team moving
 
confidence in with the team moving
forward and I think that's that's where
 
forward and I think that's that's where
that term comes from it also it it's
 
that term comes from it also it it's
advice I'm familiar with it I just
 
advice I'm familiar with it I just
wanted to clarify what Peter was talking
 
wanted to clarify what Peter was talking
about when he said criteria but and I
 
about when he said criteria but and I
was talking to a company this morning
 
was talking to a company this morning
Peter about fractional Etc and they were
 
Peter about fractional Etc and they were
supplementing half their team with with
 
supplementing half their team with with
contractors Etc
 
contractors Etc
so that's good and my question for you
 
so that's good and my question for you
is that would be really cool to see
 
is that would be really cool to see
across the port you know your your
 
across the port you know your your
companies do you all have plans to to
 
companies do you all have plans to to
tackle that at some point or is it just
 
tackle that at some point or is it just
well if if those employees are being
 
well if if those employees are being
granted Equity then we could but my
 
granted Equity then we could but my
instinct is that there's a lot of
 
instinct is that there's a lot of
non-equity agreements that are happening
 
non-equity agreements that are happening
that we just don't see so card is a
 
that we just don't see so card is a
fantastic resource for this sort of
 
fantastic resource for this sort of
hiring layouts but we are almost always
 
hiring layouts but we are almost always
tracking employees that have some sort
 
tracking employees that have some sort
of equity ownership so if you don't have
 
of equity ownership so if you don't have
Equity ownership it's kind of tough for
 
Equity ownership it's kind of tough for
us to see where you fit and that's but I
 
us to see where you fit and that's but I
I kind of I'm not surprised that you
 
I kind of I'm not surprised that you
heard that like that's kind of what I'd
 
heard that like that's kind of what I'd
been assuming was happening there's
 
been assuming was happening there's
there's the other side of the story
 
there's the other side of the story
which is both true and also way
 
which is both true and also way
overplayed of people like we've
 
overplayed of people like we've
automated entire apartments with with AI
 
automated entire apartments with with AI
like who needs customer success anymore
 
like who needs customer success anymore
all that kind of stuff I think that's
 
all that kind of stuff I think that's
mostly for now now will that
 
mostly for now now will that
will that same will I have that same
 
will that same will I have that same
opinion in a year and a half or two
 
opinion in a year and a half or two
years when people have really been able
 
years when people have really been able
to automate functions a little bit more
 
to automate functions a little bit more
cleanly maybe not but I think that most
 
cleanly maybe not but I think that most
of it is a reaction to the fundraising
 
of it is a reaction to the fundraising
Market as opposed to some like long-term
 
Market as opposed to some like long-term
strategy visava I yep I want to go back
 
strategy visava I yep I want to go back
to the the last in first out point one I
 
to the the last in first out point one I
I get a lot of friends right now who are
 
I get a lot of friends right now who are
unhappy with their roles with their jobs
 
unhappy with their roles with their jobs
with their managers something like and
 
with their managers something like and
and they'll always come to me and ask
 
and they'll always come to me and ask
for me ADV advice and one of the things
 
for me ADV advice and one of the things
I tell them is be careful about the
 
I tell them is be careful about the
devil that you don't know especially in
 
devil that you don't know especially in
today's market because of the and that's
 
today's market because of the and that's
really interesting data now that I can
 
really interesting data now that I can
point them to because it's it's a
 
point them to because it's it's a
dangerous time like if you do have job
 
dangerous time like if you do have job
security I'm somebody who's like always
 
security I'm somebody who's like always
I'm I'm very risk tolerant I'm trying to
 
I'm I'm very risk tolerant I'm trying to
take more risk in my life now seems like
 
take more risk in my life now seems like
a scary time to do that given that there
 
a scary time to do that given that there
is so much turmoil in the Venture
 
is so much turmoil in the Venture
markets and so I I want to like actually
 
markets and so I I want to like actually
transition into that and to talk about
 
transition into that and to talk about
the fund performance data that you guys
 
the fund performance data that you guys
have recently put out Nolan actually
 
have recently put out Nolan actually
before we jump there the point you just
 
before we jump there the point you just
made is reflected in our data around
 
made is reflected in our data around
voluntary versus involuntary departures
 
voluntary versus involuntary departures
which is the nice way of saying did you
 
which is the nice way of saying did you
leave by choice or did you get laid off
 
leave by choice or did you get laid off
the people who are leaving Choice it's
 
the people who are leaving Choice it's
higher than the people that are getting
 
higher than the people that are getting
laid off thankfully now but it's not
 
laid off thankfully now but it's not
that much higher the gap between those
 
that much higher the gap between those
two types of people is actually much
 
two types of people is actually much
smaller than it was in say 2019 in 2019
 
smaller than it was in say 2019 in 2019
it was like three people left for every
 
it was like three people left for every
one that got fired now it's more like
 
one that got fired now it's more like
not 50/50 but closer and it's I think
 
not 50/50 but closer and it's I think
some of that is exactly what you're
 
some of that is exactly what you're
saying people who are dissatisfied with
 
saying people who are dissatisfied with
their current gigs are looking over the
 
their current gigs are looking over the
market and saying I'm I just don't want

minutes I I I do want to talk about this
 
minutes I I I do want to talk about this
fun performance thing because it it ties
 
fun performance thing because it it ties
into what we're talking about here so
 
into what we're talking about here so
one of the things I think people don't
 
one of the things I think people don't
understand about the Venture ecosystem
 
understand about the Venture ecosystem
is that it's driven by investor returns
 
is that it's driven by investor returns
such that if an invest an invest if
 
such that if an invest an invest if
investors don't make money they won't
 
investors don't make money they won't
invest further and the ecosystem will
 
invest further and the ecosystem will
suffer so what are you guys seeing right
 
suffer so what are you guys seeing right
now in terms of fund performance yeah so
 
now in terms of fund performance yeah so
I think it's actually sometimes useful
 
I think it's actually sometimes useful
for employees at startups to take a step
 
for employees at startups to take a step
back and think about the big picture
 
back and think about the big picture
like this right I am part of an
 
like this right I am part of an
ecosystem that ecosystem has many
 
ecosystem that ecosystem has many
different nodes and players in it one of
 
different nodes and players in it one of
those nodes one of the most important
 
those nodes one of the most important
ones is Venture capitalists themselves
 
ones is Venture capitalists themselves
where are they
 
where are they
investing right now we did a big report
 
investing right now we did a big report
on 1,00 Venture funds that use Carta as
 
on 1,00 Venture funds that use Carta as
their fund admin I think it's the
 
their fund admin I think it's the
biggest such data set for emerging
 
biggest such data set for emerging
managers anywhere in the world so those
 
managers anywhere in the world so those
are managers that are running funds call
 
are managers that are running funds call
it less than100 million which are
 
it less than100 million which are
disproportionately likely as you can
 
disproportionately likely as you can
imagine to invest into companies that
 
imagine to invest into companies that
are raising small rounds so seed series
 
are raising small rounds so seed series
a etc so this is a direct impact on
 
a etc so this is a direct impact on
those kind of companies which has a
 
those kind of companies which has a
direct impact on the employees that
 
direct impact on the employees that
those companies hire right now fund
 
those companies hire right now fund
performance is not doing so high as you
 
performance is not doing so high as you
can imagine it's very closely it has to
 
can imagine it's very closely it has to
be in some ways a reflection of the
 
be in some ways a reflection of the
broader startup ecosystem so as
 
broader startup ecosystem so as
valuations for portfolio companies go
 
valuations for portfolio companies go
down the valuation of the fund the tvpi
 
down the valuation of the fund the tvpi
of the fund also declines we've been
 
of the fund also declines we've been
seeing that quarter over quarter since
 
seeing that quarter over quarter since
you know the start of 2020
 
you know the start of 2020
what's interesting is that the timelines
 
what's interesting is that the timelines
in these things matter very deeply and
 
in these things matter very deeply and
they're very different if you're a
 
they're very different if you're a
startup and you can't fund raise well
 
startup and you can't fund raise well
you have about 18 to two 18 months to
 
you have about 18 to two 18 months to
two years to figure it out if you're a
 
two years to figure it out if you're a
venture fund and you envisioning being
 
venture fund and you envisioning being
unable to fund raise in the future
 
unable to fund raise in the future
you're still deploying that first fund
 
you're still deploying that first fund
for three to five years and then you're
 
for three to five years and then you're
probably at that fund that fund is in
 
probably at that fund that fund is in
existence for another 15 years sometimes
 
existence for another 15 years sometimes
so it is a
 
so it is a
it's a the feedback loop for actual VCS
 
it's a the feedback loop for actual VCS
is much slower than it is for Founders
 
is much slower than it is for Founders
and that causes problems because as you
 
and that causes problems because as you
mentioned a lot of LPS the people invest
 
mentioned a lot of LPS the people invest
into these VCS they're looking around
 
into these VCS they're looking around
Venture and they're saying I haven't
 
Venture and they're saying I haven't
gotten the returns that I was expecting
 
gotten the returns that I was expecting
there's no recycled Capital you know if
 
there's no recycled Capital you know if
I'm Stanford endowment sure no problem I
 
I'm Stanford endowment sure no problem I
just keep investing the way that I have
 
just keep investing the way that I have
been if I'm a high net worth individual
 
been if I'm a high net worth individual
who just started investing into Venture
 
who just started investing into Venture
funds as an LP maybe I do something else
 
funds as an LP maybe I do something else
with my money interest rates are now
 
with my money interest rates are now
much higher you know there's there's a
 
much higher you know there's there's a
whole other like Universe of economic
 
whole other like Universe of economic
things I could do and that puts a lot of
 
things I could do and that puts a lot of
these emerging fund managers at risk and
 
these emerging fund managers at risk and
the ecosystem right like this is this is
 
the ecosystem right like this is this is
the thing that I don't think people are
 
the thing that I don't think people are
fully comprehending which is if
 
fully comprehending which is if
companies aren't doing well or if
 
companies aren't doing well or if
they're not getting to liquidity
 
they're not getting to liquidity
moments and investors are losing money
 
moments and investors are losing money
they're going to stop investing into the

you track through Carta over a million a
 
you track through Carta over a million a
million employees yeah oh my God this is
 
million employees yeah oh my God this is
a huge portion of our economy that I
 
a huge portion of our economy that I
don't think is like people are like
 
don't think is like people are like
actually understanding so I want to talk
 
actually understanding so I want to talk
about like the liquidity moments too
 
about like the liquidity moments too
what are you seeing in terms of timeline
 
what are you seeing in terms of timeline
to liquidity and specifically what I
 
to liquidity and specifically what I
mean is mmaa and IPO because that's when
 
mean is mmaa and IPO because that's when
investors get their money back yeah so
 
investors get their money back yeah so
it takes takes forever I mean it's it's
 
it takes takes forever I mean it's it's
like a very long time between those two
 
like a very long time between those two
things m&amp;a on one side most of the exits
 
things m&amp;a on one side most of the exits
that happen to venture pack companies
 
that happen to venture pack companies
are of the acquisition type not IPO as
 
are of the acquisition type not IPO as
you can imagine very very few companies
 
you can imagine very very few companies
actually end up making it to the
 
actually end up making it to the
NASDAQ within m&amp;a we've actually seen
 
NASDAQ within m&amp;a we've actually seen
that it is fairly strong right now it's
 
that it is fairly strong right now it's
not going down it's rising quarter over
 
not going down it's rising quarter over
quarter something like 150 companies or
 
quarter something like 150 companies or
so get acquired off of Carta every
 
so get acquired off of Carta every
quarter

so you know that's a pretty decent
 
so you know that's a pretty decent
number of companies different decent
 
number of companies different decent
chunk of things what what was it like a
 
chunk of things what what was it like a
year ago has it do you have at the top
 
year ago has it do you have at the top
of your head what what's gone up so like
 
of your head what what's gone up so like
Q3 to Q3 a year ago was like 130 this
 
Q3 to Q3 a year ago was like 130 this
year it's probably like 163 so solid

increase in number of companies the
 
increase in number of companies the
question is what economic value is being
 
question is what economic value is being
generated through those Acquisitions
 
generated through those Acquisitions
down to the cap table and that's
 
down to the cap table and that's
something that's actually pretty
 
something that's actually pretty
difficult oddly for us to see because
 
difficult oddly for us to see because
company basically leaves Carta
 
company basically leaves Carta
immediately before they are actually
 
immediately before they are actually
acquired so it's a little difficult to
 
acquired so it's a little difficult to
tell you know some of those are just
 
tell you know some of those are just

going to be Aqua hires some of those are
going to be basically your startup shut
 
going to be basically your startup shut
down in name or in basically in practice
 
down in name or in basically in practice
but a name you got bought so like it's

today are probably less remunerative to
those stakeholders than they would have
 
those stakeholders than they would have
been in the past and then the IPOs right

on that note I was really curious and if
 
on that note I was really curious and if
you all track this to what you're seeing
 
you all track this to what you're seeing
with secondary markets and tender offers
 
with secondary markets and tender offers
yeah so tender offers there are two
 
yeah so tender offers there are two
kinds of I guess secondaries that matter
 
kinds of I guess secondaries that matter
here one we call sort of bilateral
 
here one we call sort of bilateral
transactions which is just individual

people getting together and trying to
 
people getting together and trying to
affect secondaries cter doesn't do that
 
affect secondaries cter doesn't do that
but we can see when it happens around
 
but we can see when it happens around
around a cap table the other is tender
 
around a cap table the other is tender

so you know people might be familiar
 
so you know people might be familiar
with say stripe doing this where they
 
with say stripe doing this where they
say look we're not going to go public
 
say look we're not going to go public
but we want to give our employees some
 
but we want to give our employees some
liquidity so what we're going to do is
 
liquidity so what we're going to do is
we're going to host a tender offer
 
we're going to host a tender offer
secondary event where our employees can
 
secondary event where our employees can

to follow the late stage valuations as

know secondaries pop up a little bit

throughout the Venture ecosystem so yeah
 
throughout the Venture ecosystem so yeah
there's ways to get around some of this
 
there's ways to get around some of this
but we won't really be healthy until
 
but we won't really be healthy until
companies start iping do you have a
 
companies start iping do you have a
sense as to why they're not like I'm
 
sense as to why they're not like I'm
looking at the S&amp;P right now and it
 
looking at the S&amp;P right now and it
appears to be ripping and it's you know
 
appears to be ripping and it's you know
it feels like if you just invested in
 
it feels like if you just invested in
the S&amp;P 500 Index you'd be doing quite
 
the S&amp;P 500 Index you'd be doing quite
well over the last couple of years but I
 
well over the last couple of years but I
keep hearing IPO markets are closed like
 
keep hearing IPO markets are closed like
where is the dissonance what am I not
 
where is the dissonance what am I not
understanding my instinct is there are
 
understanding my instinct is there are
two reasons for this so one if you like
 
two reasons for this so one if you like
Subs segment that S&amp;P like how much of
 
Subs segment that S&amp;P like how much of
that growth is actually concentrated in
 
that growth is actually concentrated in
seven names and really if you're just
 
seven names and really if you're just
talking about the broader swath of SAS
 
talking about the broader swath of SAS
companies they haven't actually been
 
companies they haven't actually been
performing that well in the public
 
performing that well in the public
markets the second reason is that some
 
markets the second reason is that some
of the best names that you would expect
 
of the best names that you would expect
to IPO don't need to so if you're stripe
 
to IPO don't need to so if you're stripe
why IPO
 
why IPO
what's the point you have unlimited
 
what's the point you have unlimited
Capital here in the private markets you
 
Capital here in the private markets you
can affect those tender offers so that
 
can affect those tender offers so that
your employees stay liquid and respons
 
your employees stay liquid and respons
or you know are excited about the
 
or you know are excited about the
company and you avoid a bunch of
 
company and you avoid a bunch of
oversight what's wrong with that so I
 
oversight what's wrong with that so I
think for the biggest possible names IPO
 
think for the biggest possible names IPO
is actually in some ways just taking on
 
is actually in some ways just taking on
a regulatory burden that you may not
 
a regulatory burden that you may not
need to do that doesn't apply to very
 
need to do that doesn't apply to very
many companies but it applies to the
 
many companies but it applies to the
most well-known companies and that's
 
most well-known companies and that's
kind of you know as you think about a
 
kind of you know as you think about a
regulatory challenge making going public
 
regulatory challenge making going public
more attractive to the best names would
 
more attractive to the best names would
be something that I think probably
 
be something that I think probably
deserves some look damn I had never
 
deserves some look damn I had never
considered that so you're basically
 
considered that so you're basically
saying if you're
 
saying if you're
stripe and you're able to get liquidity
 
stripe and you're able to get liquidity
to your employees you're able to get
 
to your employees you're able to get
liquidity to your early investors
 
liquidity to your early investors
because there's demand in the private
 
because there's demand in the private
markets for your Equity what is your
 
markets for your Equity what is your
incentive
 
incentive
to go
 
to go
IPO I had never considered that but I'm
 
IPO I had never considered that but I'm
I'm actually like struggling right now
 
I'm actually like struggling right now
to figure out what that incentive would
 
to figure out what that incentive would
be and to others like stripe that are in
 
be and to others like stripe that are in
the similar positions why did they go
 
the similar positions why did they go
IPO best thing I can think of is people
 
IPO best thing I can think of is people
you know have dreams of seeing their
 
you know have dreams of seeing their
name on The Well access to Capital is
 
name on The Well access to Capital is
the is the primary argument but the best
 
the is the primary argument but the best
names actually don't struggle to have
 
names actually don't struggle to have
access to Capital and they've you know
 
access to Capital and they've you know
over the last few years have raised a
 
over the last few years have raised a
 ton of money so like their coffers
 
 ton of money so like their coffers
are probably already full and we're
 
are probably already full and we're
entering an era of AI to where
 
entering an era of AI to where
theoretically they can get more
 
theoretically they can get more
operational leverage such that they
 
operational leverage such that they
won't be spending as much as they had
 
won't be spending as much as they had
been spending in the years's past damn I
 
been spending in the years's past damn I
had never thought about that I think
 
had never thought about that I think
it's a to be clear this is a very elite
 
it's a to be clear this is a very elite
problem right like there are not that
 
problem right like there are not that
many companies for whom the private
 
many companies for whom the private
Capital markets could suffice forever or
 
Capital markets could suffice forever or
that have that much interests so in some
 
that have that much interests so in some
ways the the need to IPO would maybe be
 
ways the the need to IPO would maybe be
stronger in that like second tier of
 
stronger in that like second tier of
late stage firms but yeah I mean I think
 
late stage firms but yeah I mean I think
part of this is just the gigantic growth
 
part of this is just the gigantic growth
of private Capital over the last 10
 
of private Capital over the last 10
years where you know open AI is funding
 
years where you know open AI is funding
a what size billion dollar round with
 
a what size billion dollar round with
you know a bunch of people you have to
 
you know a bunch of people you have to
have write a 200 100 billion plus
 
have write a 200 100 billion plus
rumored $250 million check to get in the
 
rumored $250 million check to get in the
door like the fact that that kind of
 
door like the fact that that kind of
capitals available to them as a private
 
capitals available to them as a private
company is leagues beyond what would
 
company is leagues beyond what would
have happened 10 or 15 years ago so in
 
have happened 10 or 15 years ago so in
some ways this is a story of just the
 
some ways this is a story of just the
growth of private markets as a whole and
 
growth of private markets as a whole and
you know eventually you run into this
 
you know eventually you run into this
problem where the kind of the point of
 
problem where the kind of the point of
the public market is that retail
 
the public market is that retail
investors can take part in the growth of
 
investors can take part in the growth of

some of these tech

companies that's I think that's
important for us as a country I think it
 
important for us as a country I think it
individually kind of like makes it hard
 
individually kind of like makes it hard
to make that case to some Founders who
 
to make that case to some Founders who
are like why why would I do that man
 
are like why why would I do that man
that's so interesting okay I want to go
 
that's so interesting okay I want to go
back to a comment made around the the
 
back to a comment made around the the
seed data that you're seeing so you said
 
seed data that you're seeing so you said
about half of the number of you're
 
about half of the number of you're
seeing half the number of new rounds as
 
seeing half the number of new rounds as
you did like during Peak what does that
 
you did like during Peak what does that
data look like for the rest of like
 
data look like for the rest of like
series a and Beyond similarly down I
 
series a and Beyond similarly down I
think it's actually a little bit down
 
think it's actually a little bit down
further the closer that you are to IPO
 
further the closer that you are to IPO
so the the downturn hit the closest to
 
so the the downturn hit the closest to
IPO companies fastest in terms of new
 
IPO companies fastest in terms of new
rounds total raised Etc as people kind
 
rounds total raised Etc as people kind
of reset their
 
of reset their
expectations that you know it's the
 
expectations that you know it's the
again the Su of this is just a question
 
again the Su of this is just a question
of what is normal is it useful to
 
of what is normal is it useful to
compare ourselves to 2021 or was that
 
compare ourselves to 2021 or was that
the sugar high and actually where we are
 
the sugar high and actually where we are
right now is quote unquote more normal
 
right now is quote unquote more normal
even though it feels much more difficult
 
even though it feels much more difficult
obviously if you're using that Peak as a
 
obviously if you're using that Peak as a
reference point I think there's actually
 
reference point I think there's actually
probably some legitimacy in that it's
 
probably some legitimacy in that it's
not just investors trying to calm
 
not just investors trying to calm
Founders down like this is a more normal
 
Founders down like this is a more normal
ecosystem outside of some AI bubble
 
ecosystem outside of some AI bubble
infrastructure stuff so it's it's just a
 
infrastructure stuff so it's it's just a
question of whether or not those rounds
 
question of whether or not those rounds
will continue to pick back up and some
 
will continue to pick back up and some
of that is outside the control of all
 
of that is outside the control of all
participants in this ecosystem I'm
 
participants in this ecosystem I'm
thinking specifically here of the FED
 
thinking specifically here of the FED
like fed if you if you plot Venture
 
like fed if you if you plot Venture
rounds against the FED interest rate
 
rounds against the FED interest rate
like the correlation is not one to one
 
like the correlation is not one to one
but it's pretty inversely correlated so
 
but it's pretty inversely correlated so
hey if 50 basis points cut what does
 
hey if 50 basis points cut what does
that mean for Venture in 2025 I don't
 
that mean for Venture in 2025 I don't
think it means anything bad for Venture
 
think it means anything bad for Venture
in 2025 we put it that way Peter I'm
 
in 2025 we put it that way Peter I'm
curious how the sugar high of 21 as you
 
curious how the sugar high of 21 as you
put it correlates to what I felt was a
 
put it correlates to what I felt was a
sugar high when I was in a CPO role in
 
sugar high when I was in a CPO role in
 
pretty big sugar high I just haven't
 
pretty big sugar high I just haven't
really compared the two anything on top
 
really compared the two anything on top
of your head between those eras our data
 
of your head between those eras our data
isn't amazing back to 2014 or 2008 so I
 
isn't amazing back to 2014 or 2008 so I
don't have great numbers here when I I I
 
don't have great numbers here when I I I
think one of the distinctions between
 
think one of the distinctions between
those two periods was well twofold one
 
those two periods was well twofold one
and 2021 were basically at the end of 10
 
and 2021 were basically at the end of 10
years of very very very low interest
 
years of very very very low interest
rates so like the accumulated Capital
 
rates so like the accumulated Capital
expansion there is very high and the
 
expansion there is very high and the
second is of course the pandemic which I
 
second is of course the pandemic which I
think it's underrated after the initial
 
think it's underrated after the initial
scare of April 2020 what the pandemic
 
scare of April 2020 what the pandemic
did to Venture where I'm not sure if it
 
did to Venture where I'm not sure if it
was because everyone was at home and
 
was because everyone was at home and
it's all you could do or what but like
 
it's all you could do or what but like
crypto Venture things went Bonkers over
 
crypto Venture things went Bonkers over
those 18 months I mean there were
 
those 18 months I mean there were
multiple deals that you know you would
 
multiple deals that you know you would
probably the participants now would look
 
probably the participants now would look
back and say the moment I signed that I
 
back and say the moment I signed that I
knew that was overvalued by 300% right
 
knew that was overvalued by 300% right
and it's just kind of like you get
 
and it's just kind of like you get
caught up in a wave so I and the the
 
caught up in a wave so I and the the
pandemic had a whole host of other more
 
pandemic had a whole host of other more
significant impacts obviously on health
 
significant impacts obviously on health
and everything else but for Venture I
 
and everything else but for Venture I
think it was like a before and after
 
think it was like a before and after
sort of moment yeah it it feels like
 
sort of moment yeah it it feels like
we're in a moment of resetting
 
we're in a moment of resetting
expectations as to what like especially
 
expectations as to what like especially
for employees about like what working in
 
for employees about like what working in
Venture actually is and the stuff that
 
Venture actually is and the stuff that
you're describing right now is is
 
you're describing right now is is
actually leading me to a hypothesis but
 
actually leading me to a hypothesis but
I want to actually first ask about
 
I want to actually first ask about
shutdowns you said you know basically
 
shutdowns you said you know basically
half of the rounds are getting done
 
half of the rounds are getting done
roughly that we saw during Peak zer
 
roughly that we saw during Peak zer
we're seeing an uptick in m&amp;a which may
 
we're seeing an uptick in m&amp;a which may
be attributed to either companies
 
be attributed to either companies
shutting down or Aqua hire sorts of
 
shutting down or Aqua hire sorts of
things which is kind of what I'm hearing
 
things which is kind of what I'm hearing
and what my belief is what's going on
 
and what my belief is what's going on
with company shutdowns right now they're
 
with company shutdowns right now they're
definitely up they're Rising 2024 the
 
definitely up they're Rising 2024 the
first half of 20124 more companies shut
 
first half of 20124 more companies shut
down on CA than we'd ever seen in six
 
down on CA than we'd ever seen in six
months now that sounds bad and it isn't
 
months now that sounds bad and it isn't
good but it also has to be taken
 
good but it also has to be taken
relative to the total you know data set
 
relative to the total you know data set
size that Carter has access to so more
 
size that Carter has access to so more
companies have joined CA and more
 
companies have joined CA and more
companies got funded and so therefore we
 
companies got funded and so therefore we
would expect shutdowns to be generally
 
would expect shutdowns to be generally
higher if unless the percentage of
 
higher if unless the percentage of
startups that actually make it out would
 
startups that actually make it out would
increase and there's really no reason
 
increase and there's really no reason
why you would think that so if nine out
 
why you would think that so if nine out
of 10 startups are going to shut down
 
of 10 startups are going to shut down
then that 90% shutdown is going to
 
then that 90% shutdown is going to
happen if it happens on a bigger data
 
happen if it happens on a bigger data
set then obviously the the absolute
 
set then obviously the the absolute
numbers are going to be higher I do
 
numbers are going to be higher I do
think you're at a very acute point in
 
think you're at a very acute point in
shutdowns though where we are about two
 
shutdowns though where we are about two
two and a half years past the real
 
two and a half years past the real
downturn beginning in early 22 and maybe
 
downturn beginning in early 22 and maybe
it really didn't take hold in Venture
 
it really didn't take hold in Venture
and people weren't really hipped to it
 
and people weren't really hipped to it
until mid 2022 so two years on that's a
 
until mid 2022 so two years on that's a
pretty interesting Mark right companies
 
pretty interesting Mark right companies
would have had to do one of three things
 
would have had to do one of three things
one change their business keep
 
one change their business keep
fundraising like make it out two change
 
fundraising like make it out two change
their business but Venture investors are
 
their business but Venture investors are
no longer that interested in them or
 
no longer that interested in them or
maybe their business doesn't work with
 
maybe their business doesn't work with
high interest rates and then you have to
 
high interest rates and then you have to
bridge or extend or struggle along or
 
bridge or extend or struggle along or
three try to do that pay
 
three try to do that pay
fail and then shut down it takes a while
 
fail and then shut down it takes a while
to do those pivots and do that trial so
 
to do those pivots and do that trial so
I'm not surprised that more of those say
 
I'm not surprised that more of those say
unicorns haven't shut down yet they have
 
unicorns haven't shut down yet they have
one they had a lot of capital on the
 
one they had a lot of capital on the
books and two they had some time to make
 
books and two they had some time to make
these changes I think the rubber hits
 
these changes I think the rubber hits
the road in the next year where it's
 
the road in the next year where it's
like either you made the changes and
 
like either you made the changes and
you're going to continue as this kind of
 
you're going to continue as this kind of
business or you're looking for a path
 
business or you're looking for a path
out maybe that's an acquisition or maybe
 
out maybe that's an acquisition or maybe
you have to shut down shop so it kind of
 
you have to shut down shop so it kind of
feels like we're over the biggest hump
 
feels like we're over the biggest hump
of this but we we still have more after
 
of this but we we still have more after
effects to experience yeah I do feel
 
effects to experience yeah I do feel
like the Heat's getting turned up in the
 
like the Heat's getting turned up in the
kitchen on kind of like what's it going
 
kitchen on kind of like what's it going
to be you know tender sex tender
 
to be you know tender sex tender
secondary IPO m&amp;a raise some of that
 
secondary IPO m&amp;a raise some of that
heat is coming from younger companies
 
heat is coming from younger companies
right so like investors don't have to
 
right so like investors don't have to
keep investing in the companies they've
 
keep investing in the companies they've
already invested in they can they can if
 
already invested in they can they can if
you're a series a investor you can say
 
you're a series a investor you can say
look you raised your seed round in 2021
 
look you raised your seed round in 2021
you're growing 40% a year here's this
 
you're growing 40% a year here's this
company that raised their seed round 8
 
company that raised their seed round 8
months ago they're growing 300% a year
 
months ago they're growing 300% a year
it's just a different sort of thing you
 
it's just a different sort of thing you
have to compete with all of the younger
 
have to compete with all of the younger
cohorts that didn't have this valuation
 
cohorts that didn't have this valuation
overhang to put on their cap tables
 
overhang to put on their cap tables
they're coming up clean and that's hard
 
they're coming up clean and that's hard
totally yeah it is and I know you know
 
totally yeah it is and I know you know
this shows about the data and all the
 
this shows about the data and all the
data you swim in Peter and I love it but
 
data you swim in Peter and I love it but
anecdotally a lot of employees in these
 
anecdotally a lot of employees in these
companies are also starting to ask what
 
companies are also starting to ask what
are we doing here what's it going to be
 
are we doing here what's it going to be
and I feel like that pressure is getting
 
and I feel like that pressure is getting
turned up as well I totally agree with
 
turned up as well I totally agree with
you Kelly and this this kind of goes to
 
you Kelly and this this kind of goes to
my hypothesis that I was referring to
 
my hypothesis that I was referring to
earlier so if you have more
 
earlier so if you have more
shutdowns fewer new rounds you know a
 
shutdowns fewer new rounds you know a
little bit more m&amp;a activity which is
 
little bit more m&amp;a activity which is
basically attributed potentially to Aqua
 
basically attributed potentially to Aqua
hires it seems to me that the thing that
 
hires it seems to me that the thing that
we're going to see next is this like
 
we're going to see next is this like
Talent consolidation
 
Talent consolidation
phase such that the the biggest and best
 
phase such that the the biggest and best
companies are going to to continue to
 
companies are going to to continue to
acquire great talent because it felt
 
acquire great talent because it felt
like you know call it during the last 10
 
like you know call it during the last 10
to 12 years Talent started to get
 
to 12 years Talent started to get
distributed and there was this distrib
 
distributed and there was this distrib
you know great talent was kind of going
 
you know great talent was kind of going
everywhere I had friends at all
 
everywhere I had friends at all
different sorts of Industries and
 
different sorts of Industries and
sectors but now given that you have and
 
sectors but now given that you have and
the other piece is less liquidity right
 
the other piece is less liquidity right
so what you just mentioned Kelly if I'm
 
so what you just mentioned Kelly if I'm
an employee and I have my pick of the
 
an employee and I have my pick of the
litter one of the things I'm starting to
 
litter one of the things I'm starting to
think about is like who can actually
 
think about is like who can actually
like Get My Equity worth real dollars
 
like Get My Equity worth real dollars
yes
 
yes
and so when you think it it just feels
 
and so when you think it it just feels
like the rich are going to get richer
 
like the rich are going to get richer
during this next phase I think that's I
 
during this next phase I think that's I
think that's a completely reasonable
 
think that's a completely reasonable
hypothesis of the world what it mandates
 
hypothesis of the world what it mandates
though is that the elite are going to
 
though is that the elite are going to
hire in a way that they used to whereas
 
hire in a way that they used to whereas
maybe they won't my instinct candidly is
 
maybe they won't my instinct candidly is
to be like look if fundraising is going
 
to be like look if fundraising is going
well and if fundraising in a general
 
well and if fundraising in a general
pops back hiring will pick up I don't
 
pops back hiring will pick up I don't
know if we as human beings are able to
 
know if we as human beings are able to
be Capital efficient when some external
 
be Capital efficient when some external
force is enforcing us to right like
 
force is enforcing us to right like
people will probably start throwing
 
people will probably start throwing
headcount at problems again if
 
headcount at problems again if
fundraising got materially easier I I
 
fundraising got materially easier I I
think I deeply believe that we haven't
 
think I deeply believe that we haven't
solved our ability to like get into
 
solved our ability to like get into
bubbles however I agree with you that I
 
bubbles however I agree with you that I
I think Talent consolidation is is one
 
I think Talent consolidation is is one
aspect of this that's probably going to
 
aspect of this that's probably going to
happen over the next one to two years
 
happen over the next one to two years
and then it's really incumbent upon the
 
and then it's really incumbent upon the
employee to say
 
employee to say
yeah where is My Equity likely to be
 
yeah where is My Equity likely to be
worth something and then also which
 
worth something and then also which
companies are thinking strategically
 
companies are thinking strategically
about liquidity and how are they
 
about liquidity and how are they
thinking about liquidity I mean we've
 
thinking about liquidity I mean we've
seen some models and they have a story
 
seen some models and they have a story
for it yeah we've seen some models
 
for it yeah we've seen some models
lately that popped up that are different
 
lately that popped up that are different
like open AI does not have standard isos
 
like open AI does not have standard isos
right so there are ways in which you
 
right so there are ways in which you
could build equity that doesn't exactly
 
could build equity that doesn't exactly
look like ownership does today but
 
look like ownership does today but
offers the employee enhanced chances for
 
offers the employee enhanced chances for
liquidity as a employee benefit I know
 
liquidity as a employee benefit I know
that I would be looking for that as an
 
that I would be looking for that as an
employee I hope that if you're in the
 
employee I hope that if you're in the
you know enviable position of being
 
you know enviable position of being
sought after by multiple startups that's
 
sought after by multiple startups that's
one of the things that you're asking and
 
one of the things that you're asking and
crypto as well that's a different model
 
crypto as well that's a different model
which is interesting with a token model
 
which is interesting with a token model
and more more frequent to both of your
 
and more more frequent to both of your
points and I just talked to someone this
 
points and I just talked to someone this
morning I also think we're probably
 
morning I also think we're probably
going to see talent flocking to
 
going to see talent flocking to
different Industries than before do you
 
different Industries than before do you
know what I mean crypto security AI life
 
know what I mean crypto security AI life
sciences right these industries
 
sciences right these industries
where they're they're doing well to your
 
where they're they're doing well to your
point around companies that can get them
 
point around companies that can get them
liquidity Etc you know I'll speak for
 
liquidity Etc you know I'll speak for
myself I mean I've been Enterprise SAS
 
myself I mean I've been Enterprise SAS
for a while it's like oh maybe you go
 
for a while it's like oh maybe you go
somewhere else like I think I think
 
somewhere else like I think I think
you're going to see Talent more
 
you're going to see Talent more
Diversified outside of maybe where
 
Diversified outside of maybe where
they've lived the past 10 years yeah I
 
they've lived the past 10 years yeah I
don't I mean I don't think SAS is going
 
don't I mean I don't think SAS is going
away maybe it's changing pretty
 
away maybe it's changing pretty
significantly sure but there's also
 
significantly sure but there's also
a question around Venture Capital like
 
a question around Venture Capital like
as the default pathway for a lot of
 
as the default pathway for a lot of
these startups never really should have
 
these startups never really should have
been the default pathway and honestly it
 
been the default pathway and honestly it
really never was except for we and we
 
really never was except for we and we
and VCB startups are very good about
 
and VCB startups are very good about
talking about ourselves so it kind of
 
talking about ourselves so it kind of
feels that way if you're online but in
 
feels that way if you're online but in
general you know there's a ton of
 
general you know there's a ton of
companies that are going to get started
 
companies that are going to get started
look at the VC funding model and go H
 
look at the VC funding model and go H
not for us now what those companies do
 
not for us now what those companies do
to incentivize employees in terms of
 
to incentivize employees in terms of
ownership they can still do very inter
 
ownership they can still do very inter
in things with Equity they just don't
 
in things with Equity they just don't
have a lot of investors and maybe
 
have a lot of investors and maybe
they're growing at different rates than
 
they're growing at different rates than
your standard VC backed company but it's
 
your standard VC backed company but it's
a it's a cool and interesting time to
 
a it's a cool and interesting time to
hey if I'm a Founder can I bootstrap
 
hey if I'm a Founder can I bootstrap
this to an amazing exit for me and for
 
this to an amazing exit for me and for
my employees as opposed to for my
 
my employees as opposed to for my
investors yep last question for me Peter
 
investors yep last question for me Peter
is around how much of the equity is
 
is around how much of the equity is
going back to the pool so let me just
 
going back to the pool so let me just
like refresh we had this conversation
 
like refresh we had this conversation
last time but when when you leave a
 
last time but when when you leave a
company and you have unvested options uh
 
company and you have unvested options uh
that those options go back into the pool
 
that those options go back into the pool
but even for your vested options which
 
but even for your vested options which
is where I want to focus the question
 
is where I want to focus the question
most companies have a 90day
 
most companies have a 90day
posttermination exercise window which
 
posttermination exercise window which
means that you have 90 days to Shell out
 
means that you have 90 days to Shell out
a bunch of cash to ensure that the
 
a bunch of cash to ensure that the
options that you earned are still yours
 
options that you earned are still yours
long past those 90 days of the vested
 
long past those 90 days of the vested
options what's being returned to the
 
options what's being returned to the
pool right now do you guys have data on
 
pool right now do you guys have data on
that we do so in this data set
 
that we do so in this data set
you know we look at the percentage of
 
you know we look at the percentage of
options that have been vested that were
 
options that have been vested that were
exercised before their vesting period
 
exercised before their vesting period
expired so why would it why would that
 
expired so why would it why would that
period expire one because they've been
 
period expire one because they've been
there for for 10 years which is very
 
there for for 10 years which is very
very few people or two they left the
 
very few people or two they left the
company either by choice or through
 
company either by choice or through
layoff so in that 90-day period
 
layoff so in that 90-day period
effectively what this chart is showing
 
effectively what this chart is showing
is just in that 90-day period what
 
is just in that 90-day period what
percent of f actually exercise their
 
percent of f actually exercise their
equity and take full ownership of that
 
equity and take full ownership of that
those shares right now that percentage
 
those shares right now that percentage
is like
 
is like
 
returning to the pool at the peak in
 
returning to the pool at the peak in
 
drop is it's about half as much why is
 
drop is it's about half as much why is
that happening some of it is good
 
that happening some of it is good
financial decision making by those
 
financial decision making by those
employees they're saying look I'm
 
employees they're saying look I'm
getting laid off I don't believe in the
 
getting laid off I don't believe in the
prospects of this company why would I
 
prospects of this company why would I
shell out cash right now for something I
 
shell out cash right now for something I
don't believe in long term some of that
 
don't believe in long term some of that
is probably an inability to come up with
 
is probably an inability to come up with
enough cash to buy the options that want
 
enough cash to buy the options that want
and then the third thing is either a
 
and then the third thing is either a
lack of Education or a like a
 
lack of Education or a like a
misapprehension about where the company
 
misapprehension about where the company
is
 
is
going my instinct is that a lot of these
 
going my instinct is that a lot of these
these decisions are being made by
 
these decisions are being made by
employees and they're good financial
 
employees and they're good financial
decisions there's obviously a portion of
 
decisions there's obviously a portion of
it where I'm sure that they wish they
 
it where I'm sure that they wish they
could exercise my only you know point on
 
could exercise my only you know point on
all this and it's the same one that I'll
 
all this and it's the same one that I'll
I've made before is just that 90 days is
 
I've made before is just that 90 days is
a silly amount of time to have to make
 
a silly amount of time to have to make
this decision I know why it exists
 
this decision I know why it exists
please don't at me I get the tax
 
please don't at me I get the tax
implications but I personally believe
 
implications but I personally believe
it's too little amount of time so like
 
it's too little amount of time so like
you know no and you know this at carda
 
you know no and you know this at carda
our our vesting schedule is indexed to
 
our our vesting schedule is indexed to
how long we've been at the company so
 
how long we've been at the company so
you get more time if you stay longer I
 
you get more time if you stay longer I
think that's fair I think there's a lot
 
think that's fair I think there's a lot
of ways to make this slightly more fair
 
of ways to make this slightly more fair
to
 
to
employees why does the 90day exist I
 
employees why does the 90day exist I
thought it was just because it was
 
thought it was just because it was
always that way it exists because it is
 
always that way it exists because it is
part of the requirements in order to use
 
part of the requirements in order to use
an incentive stock op versus a
 
an incentive stock op versus a
non-qualified stock option so it
 
non-qualified stock option so it
actually over 90 days you can't have a
 
actually over 90 days you can't have a
vesting period over 90 days and still
 
vesting period over 90 days and still
use the iso it converts into an NSO so
 
use the iso it converts into an NSO so
it has different taxk
 
it has different taxk
implications that is like why does that
 
implications that is like why does that
why is that a criteria no idea really
 
why is that a criteria no idea really
