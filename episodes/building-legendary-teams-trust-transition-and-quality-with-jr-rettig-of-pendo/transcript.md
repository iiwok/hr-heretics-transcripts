# Building Legendary Teams: Trust, Transition, and Quality with JR Rettig of Pendo

## Transcript

 
[Applause]
 
Jr welcome to HR Heretics thanks for
coming so excited to super happy to be
here today really excited big fan big
fan all right so I think you and Kelly
are work wives and have been working
together from what I can tell for like
the like eight years like Kelly Jr what
is the story of your relationship and
how did it come to be yeah yeah go ahead
you want to go first I think that's
appropriate um no you start my friend
you start yeah I mean I think I knew of
Kelly like a lot of people right before
I actually knew her specifically I think
when I got to Yahoo I'd heard her name
she was already gone by that point and
ultimately I honestly think I got to
know her because she was the CPO of a
vendor um that I was going to be using
so we were big hired fans back in the
day at looker and um I remember they
sent me like this Jam boox speaker and
like some bottle of like Dom and I'm
like who are these people I love them
sell me more software you
know and so then I I found out that
Kelly was there and made the connection
at that point how we came to work
together was you know I always recommend
this if you have the opportunity to hire
Your Own Boss reach for the stars with
that one you know and uh we had an
opening for a chief people officer at
looker and there were some folks who
really thought I should take the job
right they said well what what about you
why not you and you know I had said at
the time and had for a long time a lot
of people really wanted that job for me
they really wanted me they wanted me to
want the job because they wanted it for
me and you know I didn't want it then I
just didn't like I felt like my Lane was
wide enough I had enough to do I enjoyed
my team I have been a recruiter for over
 
at it and I like it right and I I
thought that that was just the the
answer and I thought it was the right
thing for the company actually at that
moment in time more importantly um I
came in as a director and I think I
would have been seen a certain way I was
a VP by that point but I really felt
like they needed someone that they could
look to respect listen to um because
they had been there and done that it was
more important for Looker um for that so
um I remember Patty McCord like
literally looking me Square in the eye
and being like why are you gonna hire
her like why not
you and I was like thanks Pat yeah right
and so it was great right so I I've been
know Patty for years and she's always a
truth teller um at all times and so that
was how it started and then we went
through the journey together of um
getting on boarded to Google we have a
great photo of us in our goofy little
propeller hats um which is a legendary
photo and uh and then you know my time I
was on that fixed term contract which I
always say boy if you can get that like
take it and run um what a great deal um
you know and I loved my time at Google I
add I worked with a guy named Nick
Captain he was just an amazing uh
partner treated me like I was a peer um
it was it was really a great time but my
time was coming to an end and I knew I
wanted to finish what I started at
looker like we kind of got cut off and I
wanted to take some a company like
beyond that thousand employee Mark and
keep going and so I I told Kelly that I
was going to leave and not try to stay
at the end of my contract and we just
started you know talking about what that
could look like right I did a couple of
interviews for some executive recruiter
friends to me to be a calibration
candidate I was like boy you owe me a
lot for that because this is
like talked to a few companies that I
didn't really even want to work at but
it was good for you know sharpening the
skills it had been a while since I'd
actually really interviewed and then
Kelly said hey I'm Consulting with the
CEO that we know through the portfolio
from some of our looker investors he
wants to talk to you about recruiting
and your point of view on recruiting and
I said great so I had a call with Todd
our CEO at pendo and I thought it was
just a you know he wants to talk to me
about my point of view on recruiting
and I told him I never really
interviewed for the job he's like what
are you talking about we had that call
and I was like
oh I had no intention right like that
that was an interview um but it you know
it went from there and so Kelly and and
I started like a week apart or so and
wow it's been awesome wow yeah yeah I
mean we we were ships in the night at
Yahoo like technically we've been
working together for I don't know over
 
really talk to J.R until 2016 at hir
after the Dom and the speakers now that
wasn't quite the sign on bonus of the
the purple Jeeps at Yahoo but that was
pretty damn good uh right days and uh we
we just hit it off you know and um then
she called me run looker I said same
thing Patty said I'm like why the hell
are you calling me why don't you take
the job uh and then of course Patty's
like just take the job to me so Patty
you know she continues to be this all
angles all angles uh and I did and you
know it's incredible when you find
someone that that you work so well with
but that also complements what you're
not good at right like I often refer to
jni as Yin and yangang like what what
I'm not good at she's very good at and
what she's not as strong at I help with
and that that is such a powerful force
if you can find that and the thing I
will say though the thing thing that
makes it work um is there has never been
one ounce of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ego in any of it
like dare I don't want the jobs we're
not trying to climb anything we're
trying to give away and work together
and so I do believe that is the secret
sauce of these relationships is
literally having no ounce of this is my
toy or this is your toy or this is my
turf this is your Turf it's all one and
that's what made it work from the very
beginning and what I told J.R I said you
got to talk to Todd and I'm going to go
do this it might be my last one for at
least a while if not for a couple years
and you got to come with me and do it
because they need you and I need you and
then you're going to take the job in
like two or three years and it's gonna
be great and I was like yeah yeah yeah
right she was like I'm like come on it's
be fun we'll we'll continue the looker
journey we'll finish it and then you'll
take this thing over once we build it
and the reason I thought of her not just
cuz I enjoy working with her but I will
tell you that it scared the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of
me when Todd and Jennifer kin our CFO
was like you know we are growing at 60%
year-over year this was over three years
ago um we need to literally hire like
 
growth and it is it is the single
biggest thing that our board is
concerned about it is the number one
reason that we might not hit our goals I
was like like I can't do this with
anyone else but Jr because she's the
best town acquisition leader in the
business and I wouldn't have gone if she
didn't come because that was so
important and it's an area that I don't
know I did not come from recruiting I am
a or culture freak I am not yeah a
recruiter and that is one thing if you
don't have great lieutenants around you
in this CPO role and areas that you're
not great at you're dead what's
interesting for me me with both of you
guys is the self-awareness so Kelly
you're talking about like I'm not good
at recruiting that's not what my skill
set is JR you had the opportunity
potentially to fight to be the chief
people officer at looker and you
didn't like that's really hard right I
mean especially if you've been in the
business and you know like people are
telling you you should be the person and
I think candidly like when you have a
lot of The Insider baseball with
relationships that actually does help
you do the job better than an outsider
potentially could yep why not push for
it then what's it maybe said differently
what's the difference between you and
CPO seat Now versus you pushing for the
CPO seat then yeah that's that's a
that's a really good question you know I
I mean I I would be remiss to not say I
was probably scared a little bit I mean
who you know like there there's that's
very real um there was a lot that I
didn't know um and you know had
we if if it had come down to hiring
someone other than Kelly or me you might
have seen me fight for it at that point
right like if I knew that we could get
her then I was fine right where I was
and we were still growing um quite a bit
at that point so I I also think that now
fast forward and it's over 3 years later
going into the fourth year and I felt
ready right I felt ready I had
relationships built up with the company
I had accomplished what I'd set out to
accomplish kind of from that scale
perspective during the kind of Boom time
right I got the team established and the
culture from a recruiting point of view
established and I was I was probably you
know thinking about oh okay we're going
to go through and do this again um and I
wanted to be in the room at that point I
like you know damn it like I I want to
be in there now so and you got to you
got to learn from Kelly I think it's a
good lesson for our audience that you
know there's there's a couple of
different ways to learn one way to learn
is just to go do it and to figure it out
while you're on the job that was
basically my career path and then the
other way is that you can go learn from
somebody that you admire um I think the
thing that often happens especially in
this role is you get layered with
somebody that you don't admire and
that's where I think it gets really
challenging and so for you to have a
hand in that process I think is is
unique and a potential lesson for number
twos and number threes you know as they
help pick it's like yeah get somebody
that you really admire and lean into
that and also a lesson for CEOs that
like you know people do have the
self-awareness to say I can learn from
this person and they're good for our
business you know versus big company
whoever who's going to come in and you
know pull the puppet strings and not do
any of the real work yeah Nolan you said
get someone in that you admire to learn
from and I actually feel really strongly
about this and I think this is the
secret sauce is I would reframe that to
learn with um it is not learn from like
we were very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] explicit and
intentional on day one
that usually we were in the same room
yeah right we would have one-on ones
with Todd together around things that
connected culture and highering
it's not just this hierarchical learn
from it's literally learn with to a
point where 14 months inde dependo we
were literally
interchangeable and and that is
something that I have rarely seen in
companies um like hey come into seite
with me let's let's attack this together
and not just your successor but anyone
that you're trying to teach learn share
that is a non- egotistical way of
working that I think um a a lot of folks
forget that you can actually architect
you can create that environment and I do
believe that's how we were able to
FastTrack this and it honestly made it
easier the last three years just in
general in in working so it's that learn
withd that I think is just something
that I I haven't seen a lot out there
and I'd love to see more of it HR
agnostic or not doesn't matter too I
hope people listen and learn from it and
I know this is in a like toot Kelly's
Horn podcast uh right don't put this in
I don't definitely not don't put what
we're here to do
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] could do that too I was really mad
at her part of the times I was really
mad at her for some of the stuff she
made me do right she'd be like oh that
looks like I'm gonna be in Tahiti during
that board meeting you know um or just
kidding I was like are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
kidding me no first of all you can cut
it out but no she's we're not kidding
because that was her way too of um you
know she she politely forced me to step
forward right and stepped aside and it
was a gradual way of doing it and I
think if you and I've always talked to I
talk to recruiting leaders about this
all the time and it's really hard
because you don't get to choose your
boss but there is that right there's
always that age-old tale of like
recruiting an HR or the recruiters don't
want to report to an HR leader who
doesn't know anything about recruiting
and you know oh it's just and I've been
there I mean you know yes and I've had
to leave right um companies is because
of it and so to have a real partnership
and to be like two in a box like that is
is just going to make your organization
so much stronger especially when
recruiting is the most important thing
which when you're scaling a company I
would argue it is it's the focus
everyone knew who I was for a while not
everyone knew Kelly but they knew who I
was yeah that's a it's a great segue I
just I'll put a a book end on it with
Kelly's throwing you into the deep end
of the pool with some floaties on right
yeah or maybe one yeah yeah you'll find
the other one like you'll be fine right
exactly there was always a life
preserver waiting it just didn't have to
be used hey everyone we'll be right back

[Music]
you all right so so J.R the moment we're
in right now it's about to be March of
 
bath as it relates to layoffs but you
work at pendo you're the chief people
officer at pendo and pendo is growing
and hiring and one of the things that I
get pinged about three to four times a
week is people saying how do I get a job
right now and it's coming from I think
two angles one angle is like the new
grad from college the other angle is I
got laid off from a startup that I
thought was going to be doing a lot
better that unfortunately is not so talk
to me about how you're evaluating
candidates today how you think these
people can get a foot in the door and
what's changed you know from The Last
Five Years yes certainly we are hiring
and at the same time right it's
intensely competitive then still because
depending on the role right if if there
roles where there isn't a lot of Talent
on the market then it's incredibly com
you know competitive for us we're
competing with other people trying to
pull top talent from companies if it's
roles where there has been a lot of
layoffs concentrated we have a lot of
really high quality candidates and that
just makes it even harder and it makes
it harder on the recruiting team because
then the noise level is higher too right
because there's quality in that in bound
funnel like I've heard some people say
that that's not worth it and I would say
that that's patently false there always
is quality you just have to find a way
to to get to it especially when you have
a brand like pendo yeah and people want
to come work there customers love us
right people love the brand they want to
work for us so they think that hey I'm
going to apply and that's going to work
and you know I I believe that it should
right I am I am not a fan of the black
hole that should work right you show
interest you should have that chance to
get the opportunity now I tell people
really simple things I forget you know I
mean it's the it's tailoring your right
tailor your resume use AI if you would
want to do it now I don't care it's
available to you be smart right but like
make your resume match the job
description help your chances of getting
through the filter you know make a
connection into the company if you can
right a quality connection ask for
someone to refer you if you have a you
know an inroad there that that helps all
the time and just know that you have to
absolutely positively be prepared right
and do research and know who you're
talking to every person right like
absolutely follow up send LinkedIn
connections thank you notes like
anything you can do to set yourself
apart and show that you care and you
want the job and here's why you are the
person for the role and be very direct
about it as far as I'm concerned right
like you have to get people's attention
you have to advocate for for yourself um
and then know you know even if you get
through the bar is high right we still
have a CEO who reviews all offers and if
you know and yeah it's it's a part of it
it's way better than where it was when I
got there and he was interviewing
everyone um we talked about this Nolan
with LJ right I'm a big fan of that I
think he's intensely focused on Talent
how can I be upset about that right not
at all bring it I welcome it like we
have a lot of really good conversations
sometimes we argue
right whatever it might be um but he is
he said you send me an offer you send me
I'm going to read everything I'm going
to read the scorecards I'm gonna read
right he wants to make sure that
everyone cares as much as he does and
sometimes you might get all the way
through to that and that offer doesn't
go through and that really sucks sucks
for the recruiting team it sucks for the
candidate right and we're in you know
those moments again right now and we'll
it's it's a good reminder because we
haven't been hiring at the velocity that
we were and people do get a little rusty
right we see some of our hiring managers
or interviewers not being as rigorous
maybe as they should be and you can't
argue I mean it's not their fault
they're not doing it on purpose right
they're just out of like they're you
know they've been shipping product for a
year and a half we haven't had a lot of
attrition in some areas right it's kind
of like they got to get back on the bike
and everyone's got to get back on their
toes again all right I want to start at
the end of The Funnel so you just
mentioned something really interesting
which is Todd reviews every offer to the
CEO pendo I love that Tony actually I
think still does it now at door Dash he
definitely did it through about 5,000
employees why is he blocking offers what
are examples of reasons why yeah and
it's very rare I would say that that I
mean very rare and I think what he'll do
is question right he will question right
and and we've actually he does a really
good job now and I said hey if you
listen to how we talk about recruiting I
don't need you to go to the recruiter I
need you to go to the hiring manager or
the hiring leader right that's who you
need to go to about this this is their
hire we are facilitating this process
right and doing this and and it's a
partnership but in the endgame they are
making the choice and they are saying I
want to hire this person for my team and
so the question needs to go there right
and will help right with whatever is
happening I do think like I said
attrition attritions been fairly decent
you know benchmarks all lined like some
areas more or less than others depending
on the market and we aren't going to
hire that much we're growing right so
we'll add a lot of new sales folks we'll
add some support here and there and
we'll backfill folks who leave and key
roles and things like that but that just
makes every hire you know instead of
hiring 200 people a quarter you know we
may hire 50 um and every one of those
then is going to get even more scrutiny
than when it was 200 it just he's going
to give the proctology exam which I'm
very familiar with the um but like
what's an what's an example recently of
where he blocked like is it because
scorecards are not filled out is it
because like there's a gap on the resume
like what's what's Todd's thing because
every CEO usually has like a thing um
you know Tony's thing was like job
hoppiness he hated when there would be
you know at a four if four is like a
strong yes like a bunch of Threes And
like nobody pounding the table Tony
whole thing was like I want somebody to
put their badge on the line for this
hire yep so what's what's what's Todd's
thing you know first of all my my
recruiting team right and some of those
folks have worked for me now again for
seven or eight years or at two or three
different companies there will never be
an incomplete scorecard there will never
be job hoppiness without a note
explaining what is going on I mean they
are on it and I'm on the sales I'm on
the sales side now and these sales
leaders are like do you got to do the
scorecards you got to do the scorecards
it's incredible I mean yeah Barack
Shannon and my recruiters are coming for
you do you know what I mean they're like
no we're not putting it through like
tough you know and so um it's not that I
think what it comes down to and
sometimes the recruiting team then can't
necessarily catch it is maybe it's in
the interviews that are more technical
right or more on you know whatever it is
about on the selling or um um you know I
think it's that I think it is what you
said about Tony it is the pounding on
the table where is my strong yes where
is like someone saying we must hire this
person they are going to be a 10x
employee they are going to make a
difference at pendo um and so I think
everyone in the company just needs to
get back on that bike and get back in in
the mode and and sometimes I think this
is his way of reminding us of that and
like I said the timing isn't always
ideal but I said to someone I'd rather
have a bad glass door review than a bad
hire it's cheaper yeah Nolan yesterday
on our segment we talked about this
notion of nodes of influence within a
company and folks that leaders respect
and that is something I've seen too if
if Todd will go through especially in
companies that are sub a thousand people
and you still have relationships and
they're star performers if Todd will go
through for example and he'll say oh s
Sally's a star and she's a
two that's interesting like that is also
something that will raise Flags around
you're going to hire this person someone
that is very very influential and great
this company does not think we should
yeah let's take a beat and make sure and
and I do applaud the whole thing and I
know people you can't scale it you can I
mean you maybe it's not every offer at
some point maybe it's a sampling but I
will tell you the accountability that
that puts in the system is real and
we've all been at companies where CEOs
their hands off the wheel people are
whatever they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] want the place
becomes fat and
average and then you got to do riffs
it's not going to work for every it's
not 100% foolproof right but it does
work and it's much more painful that to
have a fat and average company than to
have a proctology exam Jay I I do want
to get your take on how you have scaled
the recruiting team yeah and the
procedures on the recruiting team so
like the things I think about out with
interviewer training and when you are
growing and scaling and now a bunch of
new hires are talking to candidates
which is a little bit scary so talk to
me about like the the procedures that
you have in place and then also the
checks and balances yeah to ensure that
you guys are keeping the quality bar
very high and wrapped around that Jr I'd
love the audience to hear because you
you are probably the best I've seen the
business of running this thing like a
business it is not a process it is not
operational you literally talk to the
company about the recruiting business
and just how that works in your brain
because it's magical and I still haven't
really unpacked
it yeah I mean so I think first and
foremost I'm lucky in the sense that
like I have a business or operator
background and became a recruiter like
most people do sort of by accident or
happen stance and
so everything I think about and in my
job before I was a buyer for retail
stores which is a fair amount of a mix
like I think recruiting is of like Art
and Science everything comes back down
to math when it really matters there's
always math at the heart of a lot of
things and at the same time then you
have to be able to be creative and trust
your gut and do right the things that
set us apart I think as as great
recruiting leaders but the foundations
and the fundamentals of understanding
the business speaking the Lang anguage
of the business and and Nolan on the
question of scaling a
team you know I wasn't sure how to do
that in a startup setting because I had
worked in big companies and I honestly
leaned on the talent Partners from our
VCS and resources that were out there
right that Sequoia had a calculator or
something right these things that people
might think um I used all of that at
looker right to help build a business
case and speak the language that my CFO
would understand and as soon as we
agreed upon a capacity model and a
general model for how we were going to
grow the team I never had any trouble
right being able to get resources or
prove what was needed it was already you
know already the wheels were greased and
we just had to go and find the best
people and my advice there then is if
someone is out there as a TA leader
looking for a new opportunity when I did
that after the conversation with Todd
and then I spoke to the CFO Jennifer um
is her name as well we go by initials so
I'm Jr and she's JK we kind of look
alike too um people confuse us all the
time especially when I travel to other
offices she said well you know we need
to grow the company by this amount like
Kelly said if you come I will tell the
board that we can hit those numbers
right and I said okay and did some quick
math literally by hand and I was like
tell me the numbers you need to hire I
wrote them down to it and I said okay
well I need 20 people and $2 million
right and she's like okay right and
built that into the plan and budget and
but you see you have to know that
because what if you get somewhere and
then they're like you gotta you got to
scale you got to hire but you can't add
to your team and no there's no money for
agencies and no there's no money to get
any technology I mean you're completely
screwed right in that sense you have to
know you have to find a foundational
model for what that looks like and I did
not know yeah why do you think this is
not like table Stakes for every ta
leader it it you say it seems to make so
much sense and I I don't see it out
there I have not
seen this mindset out there what what is
going
on I think everyone is so focused
on you know filling wrecks right and how
many wrecks I have are just focused on
that like even you know coming from a
bigger company right like even my early
recruiting things like I you know I
wasn't thinking beyond that I knew when
I would get on comfortable or what was
untenable from how many wrecks I could
carry or what would make me successful
or not but I was never thinking of it in
that broader view right because that
wasn't the view that I had for the
company so that's why and I do think so
if people promote someone who's really
just been a recruiter um to some degree
into the role they're not going to have
the skill said anyone who hasn't done
the recruiting operations role which I
was lucky enough to do at Apple to
coordinate between both corporate and
Retail recruiting so both high volume
and then corporate recruiting and learn
all of the things about career sites and
applicant tracking and compliance and
background checks and just all these
nuts and bolts if I hadn't have done
that job I would have never been
prepared to be right ahead of recruiting
and I think so many folks are just not
right they might be a good recruit but
they don't know the fundamentals you
know it's a huge cost center when it
comes down to it we spent a lot of money
I think we spent a million dollars
recruiting for the first Apple Store in
Japan no lie like a like $1 million just
to hire people for that store um not
counting their salaries I'm talking
about just what it took to do that and
so at that point you know that's that's
a huge part of my budget for an entire
year app pendo right um so I think it
comes down to that I personally had to
unlearn the like focusing on Rex like I
think that's the hardest part of the
transition from IC recruiter to
recruiting leader is like you're just
trained on
Rex um given the the moment we're in
right now to where there's not as many
jobs open as there were in the past how
are you thinking about quality and the
quality bar like specifically with your
recruiting team and and with them on
that yeah I you know again I've been
fortunate um I have a really strong team
a fairly Senior Team I would say who has
seen you know I think we we joke around
I think my go to market recruiting team
has like 150 years of recruiting
experience right it's like six of them
or something right it's it's enormous
and they they've recruited at large
companies small companies startups
things that were successful things that
failed their innate understanding of the
business and their roles meaning like my
Enterprise sales recruiters can talk to
anyone about sales comp structures or
any complicated like ramp times and how
are we going to know early indicators
like they are I love that absolute
ninjas right when it comes to that and
same for my engineering recruiters as
well and it's just one of those things
where their bars are inherently really
high and then when you work for a
company and I this at looker it was
really hard to get a job at ER right and
that and the data and analytics piece
played a role in that like you had to
actually be a data person and know how
to write SQL and do all these things and
then we would teach you how to be a
sales engineer or we'd teach you how to
sell or we'd teach you how to service
customers they and that was after trial
and error but they figured that out if
we we continue to hire really smart data
people who actually then want to be
public some don't want to be they want
to be back doing back office type things
which is fine too there's roles for that
but those who wanted to be out in front
of customers and cared um did that at
pendo it's similar right like the people
love pendo they want to be a part of it
so there there's a lot of interest and
especially when it comes to product
management engineerings whatever it
might be there and it's not an easy
product to sell this is not some simple
right right app and so that though
inherently having a complex technology
product recruiters that are really
experienced and teams that just care
right that keeps the quality bar really
high in my estimation right seems like
your recruiters are in there though too
like they're in with the business like
when you say that they know ramp times
comp plans like it seems like they're
actually like much more integrated into
the Business Partnership aspect like
people say Business Partnership and I
roll my eyes because it's such an
overused [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] phrase but the thing it
really means is like you know what the
business is doing like you can speak the
language of the business and the only
way you get to that level is by actually
like sitting with them and understanding
what they do on a day in and day out
basis Nolan these recruiters and this is
pro tip and something that they are just
so freaking well they present along with
the HR business partner at leadership
qbrs for that business that they are on
the hook for quarterly business reviews
presenting not just the recruiting side
and the rec
literally how they're running the
recruiting side with the organizational
side together Pro tip Jr and I's
relationship like it is one business
connected and they're on the hook to do
that I mean that that is something I
have rarely seen tot it's usually like
separate it's like the the body is not
connected and it should just be like one
body and you have these recruiters who
are recruiting for roles who have no
idea what actually like those people do
in that job and that's where I think
quality gets really tough is because
it's just like you're just shooting in
the dark and you're going back to all
the resume biases that like have existed
forever you
have yeah and not only is the body not
connected it's like fighting with each
other like it's even worse than not
being connected it's like and when you
can flip that switch it's it's magical
what you can accomplish as a force in
any business Jr I have a question uh
in-house recruiting versus the agency
stuff in my time in doing this over the
years I've just heard so many different
opinions so many points of view I've
been in companies where the leader like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you I'm bringing in my own
recruiter agency we're only working with
them you can't really do anything or can
you like how do you balance all that and
you do it really well as far as
leveraging agencies and not having them
ruin things also while setting
expectations and boundaries with the
Business Leaders and how does that all
work very
confusing it it is and it's expensive
and it can be disruptive but also at the
same time it can be amazing and some
agency recruiters I mean at the
executive level are some of my best
friends in the business right to this
day that I've known for years and that I
trust implicitly and I am purely an
in-house recruiter I spent about three
months trying to go extern and it was
like orgon rejection from day one like
it was not the right thing for me um in
any stretch so at least I gave it a try
though because I'm like oh well I can do
that you know and I get all this
feedback and then I just realized I just
I didn't like it right I need to be a
part of a culture and a mission and
believe in something and run a team with
that so however I I find you know for
for those who don't like agencies are
external right like I think they are a
necessary evil if we were going to coin
that phrase but I've always said hey I
think there's probably three or four
situations only that you ever use um an
agency in one is if it's just such a
niche role that you don't have the skill
set on your recruiting team and it's
going to be completely disruptive to the
business and to their workload so
there's one right the second is you're
going into a new geography you don't
speak the language you don't know
anything about it you don't have a
recruiter there whatever that might be
absolutely positively that is the right
place to go
I think that the third is supplemental
like if you are in a huge push and you
have to add capacity very quickly there
can be some specialized recruiters
there's some like in the sales world
where we've carved out a territory or a
region so that we don't cross hairs and
say Hey you know Jennifer Bell you're
recruiting for the Midwest right for us
and putting Enterprise recks in there
that's rare but it's usually during
times and then no doubt at the sea level
absolutely positively I believe that
there should always be um an agency
involved unless you you know already
know someone and it's and and I was just
having this conversation with Elizabeth
Patterson at Sapphire yesterday who I
know was a guest on an earlier episode
and I've known her for years as well and
saying you get so much more from a
really good executive Search firm than
just candidates you're learning about
the market you're learning about comp
you're getting a survey of the industry
if they're really really good you are
getting indepth analysis of what's
happening in that you know space and why
you're seeing certain things so you're
paying for so much more than a list of
of qualified candidates in that those
are such great points I I just want to
accent that I've rarely heard people
think about it like that and to the
point of relationships now you have that
person you can go get lunch for free
eight months later and learn new things
they're texting all the time and recruit
do that Nolan knows that like recruiters
it's okay if I haven't talked to you in
five years and the first thing I text
you about is I need a favor like
recruiters don't get pissed they're just
like okay yeah what do you know what I
mean what do you need and then you kind
of come around you know but like that's
our quidd pro quo no matter what right
and then we you know like oh my gosh I
haven't spoken to that person and you
know since Yahoo or something but we're
still like great friends you just you
know you're not totally trenches
together um you know I'm not the biggest
fan of the big agency
that I've worked with I at big companies
it's okay right I think it was it was
okay some really good relationships back
in the day at Yahoo with hydrick and
some other firms that I really enjoyed
now I tend to go towards the more
Boutique independent or smaller people
who absolutely positively specialize
right they only do c they only do CMOS
right and they are the person working on
the search for you it's not in a lower
level associate or whatever that might
be and what I I try to bring to it
because I was an executive recruiter is
you you get this partnership right where
they are bringing this external view of
the market and I am giving them the
inside Baseball look into the company I
am telling them things that they would
never know not not non confidential
stuff but like do not step on this
landmine right here's what this person
is like here was everything that was
wrong with the last person that was in
the job right here and we combine to
make a very powerful force and and
that's why there's still some of my
friends is because you know in some ways
we help each other right we make it that
much more it's like a hybrid extension
of each other right and L if I have the
bandwidth to do it now that I'm Chief
people
officer my ability to do that as much
isn't there said when I was the head of
recruiting but I still do play a big
role in it that is uh so well said and
that is the perfect description of what
the partnership should look like I'm
hearing a lot of CEOs right now say hey
I don't want to use executive recruiting
Because it's too expensive and I think
it's fair I mean it is very expensive
these searches are in the $100,000 plus
range um sometimes they include
equity and that is a tough pill to
swallow but the whole idea is is if you
can coordinate and get it right and the
external recruiter is coming with the
market intelligence and the network and
you're coming with the internal
intelligence like these are are the
sacred cows these are where the bodies
are buried this is where the last person
didn't work getting that higher right is
so important and in my opinion I've gone
back and forth on this I think it's
totally worth it to spend the money
because if you get it wrong it's going
to be way more expensive for the
business yeah it is and I think there's
a way to get out in front of it and I've
learned the hard way as well but you
have to look we have an attrition rate
right that we apply to the company and
we make a plan you look at your
attrition for at the V P level look at
your attrition at the ca level plan for
it you know I will say to my finance
team I need a quarter of a million
dollars next year to space out in case
you know a couple VPS or a c-level
person decides to leave someone Flames
out wasn't a bad hire you have to budget
for it if you end up giving the money
back all the better right um you know
you're helping the bottom line but you
should never go into a new year without
budgeting you know for agencies whether
it's the the the folks I do the same
thing we we people in Japan I don't
speak Japanese we don't speak Japanese
so I look at that team I apply an
attrition rate and I take that times a
third of the salary of the average
salary of who we're going to have to
hire and we put it in the budget right
you have to do it um or else you're
going to be caught short yeah and that's
where and then you're playing from
behind and then you're asking for things
mid year and everybody hates you
especially your CFO you you just
mentioned something that me and Kelly
haven't talked a lot about which is
succession
planning how are you guys thinking about
that and how do you and Todd play
together on succession planning and what
does that look like for you yeah I mean
we just you know really had some in
terms of really putting it into play
meaning like I was able to step in um as
Kelly was you know exploring doing new
things and doing amazing our our
co-founder CTO is still a co-founder CTO
but he does not manage any people right
and so we have the head of engineering
who stepped up and moved into the Suite
this year as well we have new cro this
year so you get a fair amount of a SE
Suite that is you know new in seat and a
new team kind of blending together so at
our our latest Talent review we did have
a fairly robust conversation around
potential successors and succession
planning and really focusing it on our
successors now I'm you know a few years
out probably from needing that but have
a plan right and I'm starting to think
about what that looks like and speaking
about it candidly and then there are
some that are going to be closer than
others that we're already actively
planning for and and talking about right
now so I think that we haven't maybe
always done the best job there but
because of changes to the business we
actually made the SE Suite A little bit
smaller recently there's just it's been
a good time in the time frame where
things kind of got tough and slowed down
and we weren't so hyperfocused on that
that we were focused more on and are on
how are we going to keep our best people
here it's a huge Initiative for us this
year um identifying our top performers
and figuring out how to provide
opportunities for them to learn and earn
and network and do these things at the
same time being very realistic that if
people are going to leave right I've
I've had a conversation yesterday with a
leader and said all I ask is that you
you know if you feel comfortable let me
know give me enough lead time I'm not
going to tell I will not if you tell me
not to tell anyone I won't tell anyone
but guess what I'm going to do I'm going
to start planning we're going to start
getting things in motion until I'm going
to tell them now you have to tell
someone right but like that trust that I
feel like I have built with the company
hopefully and that you know Kelly has
laid the groundwork for is that our
leaders do tend to confide in the people
team and say hey I'm thinking about
maybe leaving or making a change will
you help me right or what does that look
like here's what I think it does for the
organization he's my thoughts right and
buil that trust up yeah for sure uh I I
think Nolan and Jr there is a very
strong correlation between a company's
culture and your ability to succession
plan very well in the C team and when I
say that I mean it's not rocket science
but if the the C team trusts the CEO or
their Chief people officer and vice
versa you can be honest about these
things and you can have a lot of runway
for planning and I have seen more so
that an executive is scared to say this
because they feel like they're going to
get ousted and
screwed and the CEO is scared on the
other side to tell the person they're
not working out because they don't like
conflict they don't want to disrupt the
business they want to recruit in secret
the more that you can get this out
earlier and make it okay to freaking do
that the easier this becomes like I
talked to Todd eight months before I
left the role but that's not always
there and it's just breaks my heart
because ultimately it impacts the
business and yeah higher the trust
Factor easier the sucession planning is
the better for the top and bottom line
what's the magic behind Okay so I'm with
you my my biggest pet peeve is when an
executive puts a notice hasn't given us
a time frame that's beyond like a couple
of weeks it's like what are we doing
here like why can't we just be adults so
what is tough what is the secret sauce
behind doing it
well yeah I mean it is tough because I I
would be like you know I'd be lying to
say that that doesn't happen because it
does right and and we we have
experienced it right and I guess I
always have to step back sometimes and
say okay what's going on in that
relationship perhaps right maybe I need
to take a look at what's happening there
or maybe you already know that oh okay
that's not surprising and so I pride us
and our team on having our finger on the
pulse in a pretty decent way that we
tend not to be surprised very often
meaning like we can either see the
signals or someone has been but it is
it's been a lot of hard work right it's
been of we've been through some tough
times you know as a company even in the
past uh few years and role eliminations
but that's also allowed these leaders
and the people team to work really
closely together on some really hard
stuff and build up their own trust in
foundations but letting us know early
right had an empty seat for a while in
the seat team it was just it hurt it
hurt the company really bad right and
you can quantify that right because it
was a cumulative effect then um that
didn't have to happen and if whatever
the situation might be whether we're
actually managing someone out of the
company right or they're choosing to
leave the ability to be upfront about it
then allows us to plan and have a search
and and have that Gap be very short
right like or if if at all right we you
know that's ideal there's always
probably going to be some kind of a gap
but like I can't stress enough we know
these executive searches take six months
nine months right it's not going to be a
 
happen so we need to like back out and
back out and back out and and be
planning for that my hot take Nolan what
is that secret sauce I agree with
everything Jr said and I just to keep it
real simple and spicy the secret sauce
is to try and eliminate all all aspects
of fear around this as much as you can
and that fear is usually based on
probably real events and Trauma of
someone getting screwed over because
they tried to communicate watching their
friend get screwed over or watching
someone else or hearing about it that is
fear and I also and I felt this too you
all you probably have too fear of that
leader losing people they don't want to
lose so they don't want to talk about it
if we're not talking about it it's not
real like if if Jr and I aren't talking
about when she's going to leave she's
not going to leave so we're not going to
talk about it until one day when she
puts in her 3-we notice and I'm like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I do I do believe this fear is
the root cause and I think if you can
work to eliminate that through trust and
just talking out loud about it and
promising that you're not going to get
screwed over talk about this like that
is the way to do it yeah I Kelly I've
thought a lot about this cuz it has
happened to me and when I reflect on it
it was my fault like I did not do a good
job telling that person that they would
not get walked out that my expectation
was we have a great relationship I will
never be mad at you if you decide you
want to leave and I think just like that
conversation yes once every three to six
months as a reminder is like all you
need to do to build the at least the
foundation of trust which is the thing
it's like you're right people are scared
because people do get walked out some
CEOs and Leadership teams are punitive
yes and will be like oh if you're not
with me you're against me I've heard
that before and those things do exist
and I think people carry that baggage
with them into new companies but the
thing I've learned from this
conversation is is it works really well
when you have trust and
relationships yeah and you can have that
as the foundation and then it could be
healthy transitions yeah like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
transition that hurt thean andt the
people involv and I don't want to like
present duckies and rainbows and
everything is wonderful because
sometimes it's just not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] possible
and and I think there is a correlation
between the ego and or insecurity of a
leader and their ability to be able to
do that and sometimes it's not possible
so I'm not advocating everyone go out
and say hey JR let's build trust I'm GNA
leave in nine month like sometimes
please you know and so use people you
trust talk to people Etc but I I just
want to be realistic as well because I
have seen CEOs on the other side y yeah
I agree absolutely Katie anything else
from you yeah I have one more question
uh there's a lot of people that listen
to this podcast which is great thank you
for all of them and the diversity of our
listeners is increasing right CEO
Founders Venture different Business
Leaders a joke we should slash the term
HR on this and just call it Heretics and
they want to know what makes a great
company you know you've been at these
magical places looker pendo and it's
kind of maybe a nebulous question hard
to answer but like what is it like in
there living with those people like what
are those strange creatures like how do
they communicate how do they work what
is the vibe and the disposition of these
places that make these places [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
awesome and how is it different from
others that you've seen because that's
something playbooks this or that but
what what are the creatures like and how
do they like communicate work together
yeah yeah you know I I think I've been
lucky um and then smart um
about working at companies with you know
even back in the day 20 years ago
talking about culture and what culture
means right and I was a
consumer gal you know what I mean for
years when you're a recruiter and you're
calling and you say this is Jr from
Apple they're going to take your call
this is Jr from Target right this is Jr
from Yahoo or Google like whatever it
might be um and there's that brand
affinity and it's out in the world and
it stands for something and believe in
it right and there's all these really
strong cultures so when it was brought
to me to like go to an Enterprise
software company first I was like I
don't get it right like you know the
most software I use at work I hate I
mean you know we're talking like over 10
years ago now but like how do people
care care what is this all about right
am I the right person because I don't
you know I don't I don't think I get it
like I need a brand I need a product I
need something right and I mean like
that people know so before I went to
looker the other job offer I had was to
go be an executive recruiter for Elon at
Tesla right and I turned it down and I I
went to this whole idea of like Can Am
Can I Give Myself permission to take the
job that I really want versus the job
that everyone else thinks I should take
right or everyone else has heard of or
my parents know who it is right what
that looks
like for me I'd already worked for Steve
Jobs for real right and so like I didn't
need to go prove something and go work
for Elon and you know and and whatever
that meant um and so I just I I went to
looker and I asked uh Frank the CEO and
Ben and and Lloyd the co-founders
because you know they knew my background
and I said
help me understand how how am I going to
relate here how am I going to understand
what this is about um and I think Lloyd
probably got it right away right you
know what I mean he was the one who was
like you know it's it's the people right
it is it is how we treat people it is
their shared Mission it's house they're
smart they care they care about each
other right they are and we had the
kitchen table at looker where anyone
could sit down it's very inclusive
everyone is welcome no stupid questions
right it was this this you know magical
place where people genuinely liked and
wanted to help each other and it was a
hard place to work because boy if you
weren't you didn't know your stuff you
were going to be lost and left behind
pretty quickly right so it was like a
great marry band of data nerds who are
like surfing before work and going
through you know 100 pounds of avocados
every week so it was amazing and and it
was about the place too and I think
pendo is like that so ler was a lot
about Santa Cruz and the ethos of that
that lifestyle right and then I look
when we looked at pendo I was like I
really want to work for a company that
isn't headquartered in Silicon Valley I
want to know what that's all about right
they they they have grown this amazing
tech company in North Carolina right
which we know has a history of of kind
of older School Tech as well but like
what are what is this going to be like
and you know I what I found I mean you
go to Raleigh North Carolina downtown
there is this now big building pink on
top it says pendo right it is amazing
everyone is proud to work there everyone
knows it's like the big bigger fish in a
smaller Pond Todd's kind of a local
celebrity can't even go eat at some
restaurants you know and and things like
that but it is this sort of shared love
of of the brand and that comes down to
it comes through in the work and that's
what I got meaning like both a looker
and a pendo we love our customers we
have a maniacal focus on the customer or
like Department of customer love these
people would would do anything for the
customer and then that means they have
to work together they have to
collaborate and customers love us so
even if they've got a bug something
isn't working they're on the support
line like they're so thrilled with this
with the experience that they have with
their rep or their person who's helping
them um and that just comes through
right and that begets that like so you
feel the goodness of it in that sense
and so I think that there has to be that
passion about something whether it's
product Excellence at Apple whether it's
the ethos of Google and of Yahoo um or
then at these smaller companies right
there has to be something that holds
everyone together and and that's what I
think makes those things special and I
can get behind that and I can sell that
even if I don't even understand what the
product does and I'm taking away that
you can actually ask that you can ask
those questions and discern that which
is the yeah okay yeah it's awesome yeah
yeah and then and then if you have a
Founder CEO leader
that wants to continue to grow and
invest in it that's another good signal
absolutely absolutely right and and and
investors who believe in you just had
our investors on stage at cko our four
earliest investors you know it's a who's
who of maritech and battery and you know
Megan Quinn and it was just you know
it's it's an amazing group and they were
talking about why they believe in pendo
and why they believe about the future of
pendo and it got the company people just
were like oh they needed to hear that
from outside right they hear it from us
so much sure but getting that from
outside and from people that are fair
really well known in that community and
who have millions of dollars invested in
the company um it was really really cool
I love that JR this has been tremendous
