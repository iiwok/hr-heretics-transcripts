at that point so I I also think that now
fast forward and it's over 3 years later
 
fast forward and it's over 3 years later
going into the fourth year and I felt
 
going into the fourth year and I felt
ready right I felt ready I had
 
ready right I felt ready I had
relationships built up with the company
 
relationships built up with the company
I had accomplished what I'd set out to
 
I had accomplished what I'd set out to

accomplish kind of from that scale
perspective during the kind of Boom time
 
perspective during the kind of Boom time
right I got the team established and the
 
right I got the team established and the
culture from a recruiting point of view
 
culture from a recruiting point of view
established and I was I was probably you

know thinking about oh okay we're going
 
know thinking about oh okay we're going
to go through and do this again um and I
 
to go through and do this again um and I
wanted to be in the room at that point I
 
wanted to be in the room at that point I
like you know damn it like I I want to
 
like you know damn it like I I want to
be in there now so and you got to you
 
be in there now so and you got to you
got to learn from Kelly I think it's a
 
got to learn from Kelly I think it's a
good lesson for our audience that you
 
good lesson for our audience that you
know there's there's a couple of
 
know there's there's a couple of
different ways to learn one way to learn
 
different ways to learn one way to learn
is just to go do it and to figure it out
 
is just to go do it and to figure it out
while you're on the job that was
 
while you're on the job that was
basically my career path and then the
 
basically my career path and then the
other way is that you can go learn from
 
other way is that you can go learn from
somebody that you admire um I think the
 
somebody that you admire um I think the
thing that often happens especially in
 
thing that often happens especially in
this role is you get layered with
 
this role is you get layered with
somebody that you don't admire and
 
somebody that you don't admire and
that's where I think it gets really
 
that's where I think it gets really
challenging and so for you to have a
 
challenging and so for you to have a
hand in that process I think is is
 
hand in that process I think is is
unique and a potential lesson for number
 
unique and a potential lesson for number
twos and number threes you know as they
 
twos and number threes you know as they
help pick it's like yeah get somebody
 
help pick it's like yeah get somebody
that you really admire and lean into
 
that you really admire and lean into
that and also a lesson for CEOs that
 
that and also a lesson for CEOs that
like you know people do have the
 
like you know people do have the
self-awareness to say I can learn from
 
self-awareness to say I can learn from
this person and they're good for our
 
this person and they're good for our
business you know versus big company
 
business you know versus big company
whoever who's going to come in and you
 
whoever who's going to come in and you
know pull the puppet strings and not do
 
know pull the puppet strings and not do
any of the real work yeah Nolan you said
 
any of the real work yeah Nolan you said
get someone in that you admire to learn
 
get someone in that you admire to learn
from and I actually feel really strongly
 
from and I actually feel really strongly
about this and I think this is the
 
about this and I think this is the
secret sauce is I would reframe that to
 
secret sauce is I would reframe that to
learn with um it is not learn from like
 
learn with um it is not learn from like
we were very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] explicit and
 
we were very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] explicit and
intentional on day one
 
intentional on day one
that usually we were in the same room

a plan right and I'm starting to think
 
a plan right and I'm starting to think
about what that looks like and speaking
 
about what that looks like and speaking
about it candidly and then there are
 
about it candidly and then there are
some that are going to be closer than
 
some that are going to be closer than
others that we're already actively
 
others that we're already actively
planning for and and talking about right
 
planning for and and talking about right

same time being very realistic that if
people are going to leave right I've
 
people are going to leave right I've
I've had a conversation yesterday with a
 
I've had a conversation yesterday with a
leader and said all I ask is that you
 
leader and said all I ask is that you
you know if you feel comfortable let me
 
you know if you feel comfortable let me
know give me enough lead time I'm not
 
know give me enough lead time I'm not
going to tell I will not if you tell me
 
going to tell I will not if you tell me
not to tell anyone I won't tell anyone
 
not to tell anyone I won't tell anyone
but guess what I'm going to do I'm going
 
but guess what I'm going to do I'm going
to start planning we're going to start
 
to start planning we're going to start
getting things in motion until I'm going
 
getting things in motion until I'm going
to tell them now you have to tell
 
to tell them now you have to tell
someone right but like that trust that I
 
someone right but like that trust that I
feel like I have built with the company
 
feel like I have built with the company
hopefully and that you know Kelly has
 
hopefully and that you know Kelly has
laid the groundwork for is that our
 
laid the groundwork for is that our
leaders do tend to confide in the people
 
leaders do tend to confide in the people
team and say hey I'm thinking about
 
team and say hey I'm thinking about
maybe leaving or making a change will
 
maybe leaving or making a change will
you help me right or what does that look
 
you help me right or what does that look
like here's what I think it does for the
 
like here's what I think it does for the
organization he's my thoughts right and
 
organization he's my thoughts right and
buil that trust up yeah for sure uh I I
 
buil that trust up yeah for sure uh I I
think Nolan and Jr there is a very
 
think Nolan and Jr there is a very
strong correlation between a company's
 
strong correlation between a company's
culture and your ability to succession
 
culture and your ability to succession
plan very well in the C team and when I
 
plan very well in the C team and when I
say that I mean it's not rocket science
 
say that I mean it's not rocket science
but if the the C team trusts the CEO or
 
but if the the C team trusts the CEO or
their Chief people officer and vice
 
their Chief people officer and vice
versa you can be honest about these
 
versa you can be honest about these
things and you can have a lot of runway
 
things and you can have a lot of runway
for planning and I have seen more so
 
for planning and I have seen more so
that an executive is scared to say this
 
that an executive is scared to say this
because they feel like they're going to
 
because they feel like they're going to
get ousted and
 
get ousted and
screwed and the CEO is scared on the
 
screwed and the CEO is scared on the
other side to tell the person they're
 
other side to tell the person they're
not working out because they don't like
 
not working out because they don't like
conflict they don't want to disrupt the
 
conflict they don't want to disrupt the
business they want to recruit in secret
 
business they want to recruit in secret
the more that you can get this out
 
the more that you can get this out
earlier and make it okay to freaking do
 
earlier and make it okay to freaking do
that the easier this becomes like I
 
that the easier this becomes like I
talked to Todd eight months before I
 
talked to Todd eight months before I
left the role but that's not always
 
left the role but that's not always
there and it's just breaks my heart
 
there and it's just breaks my heart
because ultimately it impacts the
 
because ultimately it impacts the
business and yeah higher the trust
 
business and yeah higher the trust
Factor easier the sucession planning is
 
Factor easier the sucession planning is
the better for the top and bottom line
 
the better for the top and bottom line
what's the magic behind Okay so I'm with
 
what's the magic behind Okay so I'm with
you my my biggest pet peeve is when an
 
you my my biggest pet peeve is when an
executive puts a notice hasn't given us
 
executive puts a notice hasn't given us
a time frame that's beyond like a couple
 
a time frame that's beyond like a couple
of weeks it's like what are we doing
 
of weeks it's like what are we doing
here like why can't we just be adults so
 
here like why can't we just be adults so
what is tough what is the secret sauce
 
what is tough what is the secret sauce
behind doing it
 
behind doing it
well yeah I mean it is tough because I I
 
well yeah I mean it is tough because I I
would be like you know I'd be lying to
 
would be like you know I'd be lying to
say that that doesn't happen because it
 
say that that doesn't happen because it
does right and and we we have
 
does right and and we we have
experienced it right and I guess I
 
experienced it right and I guess I
always have to step back sometimes and
 
always have to step back sometimes and
say okay what's going on in that
 
say okay what's going on in that
relationship perhaps right maybe I need
 
relationship perhaps right maybe I need
to take a look at what's happening there
 
to take a look at what's happening there
or maybe you already know that oh okay
 
or maybe you already know that oh okay
that's not surprising and so I pride us
 
that's not surprising and so I pride us
and our team on having our finger on the
 
and our team on having our finger on the
pulse in a pretty decent way that we
 
pulse in a pretty decent way that we
tend not to be surprised very often
 
tend not to be surprised very often
meaning like we can either see the
 
meaning like we can either see the
signals or someone has been but it is
 
signals or someone has been but it is
it's been a lot of hard work right it's
 
it's been a lot of hard work right it's
been of we've been through some tough
 
been of we've been through some tough
times you know as a company even in the
 
times you know as a company even in the
past uh few years and role eliminations
 
past uh few years and role eliminations
but that's also allowed these leaders
 
but that's also allowed these leaders
and the people team to work really
 
and the people team to work really
closely together on some really hard
 
closely together on some really hard
stuff and build up their own trust in
 
stuff and build up their own trust in
foundations but letting us know early
 
foundations but letting us know early
right had an empty seat for a while in
 
right had an empty seat for a while in
the seat team it was just it hurt it
 
the seat team it was just it hurt it
hurt the company really bad right and
 
hurt the company really bad right and
you can quantify that right because it
 
you can quantify that right because it
was a cumulative effect then um that
 
was a cumulative effect then um that
didn't have to happen and if whatever
 
didn't have to happen and if whatever
the situation might be whether we're
 
the situation might be whether we're
actually managing someone out of the
 
actually managing someone out of the
company right or they're choosing to
 
company right or they're choosing to
leave the ability to be upfront about it
 
leave the ability to be upfront about it
then allows us to plan and have a search
 
then allows us to plan and have a search
and and have that Gap be very short
 
and and have that Gap be very short
right like or if if at all right we you
 
right like or if if at all right we you
know that's ideal there's always
 
know that's ideal there's always
probably going to be some kind of a gap
 
probably going to be some kind of a gap
but like I can't stress enough we know
 
but like I can't stress enough we know
these executive searches take six months
 
these executive searches take six months
nine months right it's not going to be a
 
nine months right it's not going to be a
 
happen so we need to like back out and
 
happen so we need to like back out and
back out and back out and and be
 
back out and back out and and be
planning for that my hot take Nolan what
 
planning for that my hot take Nolan what
is that secret sauce I agree with
 
is that secret sauce I agree with
everything Jr said and I just to keep it
 
everything Jr said and I just to keep it
real simple and spicy the secret sauce
 
real simple and spicy the secret sauce
is to try and eliminate all all aspects
 
is to try and eliminate all all aspects
of fear around this as much as you can
 
of fear around this as much as you can
and that fear is usually based on
 
and that fear is usually based on
probably real events and Trauma of
 
probably real events and Trauma of
someone getting screwed over because
 
someone getting screwed over because
they tried to communicate watching their
 
they tried to communicate watching their
friend get screwed over or watching
 
friend get screwed over or watching
someone else or hearing about it that is
 
someone else or hearing about it that is
fear and I also and I felt this too you
 
fear and I also and I felt this too you
all you probably have too fear of that
 
all you probably have too fear of that
leader losing people they don't want to
 
leader losing people they don't want to
lose so they don't want to talk about it
 
lose so they don't want to talk about it
if we're not talking about it it's not
 
if we're not talking about it it's not
real like if if Jr and I aren't talking
 
real like if if Jr and I aren't talking
about when she's going to leave she's
 
about when she's going to leave she's
not going to leave so we're not going to
 
not going to leave so we're not going to
talk about it until one day when she
 
talk about it until one day when she
puts in her 3-we notice and I'm like
 
puts in her 3-we notice and I'm like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I do I do believe this fear is
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I do I do believe this fear is
the root cause and I think if you can
 
the root cause and I think if you can
work to eliminate that through trust and
 
work to eliminate that through trust and
just talking out loud about it and
 
just talking out loud about it and
promising that you're not going to get
 
promising that you're not going to get
screwed over talk about this like that
 
screwed over talk about this like that
is the way to do it yeah I Kelly I've
 
is the way to do it yeah I Kelly I've
thought a lot about this cuz it has
 
thought a lot about this cuz it has
happened to me and when I reflect on it
 
happened to me and when I reflect on it
it was my fault like I did not do a good
 
it was my fault like I did not do a good
job telling that person that they would
 
job telling that person that they would
not get walked out that my expectation
 
not get walked out that my expectation
was we have a great relationship I will
 
was we have a great relationship I will
never be mad at you if you decide you
 
never be mad at you if you decide you
want to leave and I think just like that
 
want to leave and I think just like that
conversation yes once every three to six
 
conversation yes once every three to six
months as a reminder is like all you
 
months as a reminder is like all you
need to do to build the at least the
 
need to do to build the at least the
foundation of trust which is the thing
 
foundation of trust which is the thing
it's like you're right people are scared
 
it's like you're right people are scared
because people do get walked out some
 
because people do get walked out some
CEOs and Leadership teams are punitive
 
CEOs and Leadership teams are punitive
yes and will be like oh if you're not
 
yes and will be like oh if you're not
with me you're against me I've heard
 
with me you're against me I've heard
that before and those things do exist
 
that before and those things do exist
and I think people carry that baggage
 
and I think people carry that baggage
with them into new companies but the
 
with them into new companies but the
thing I've learned from this
 
thing I've learned from this
conversation is is it works really well
 
conversation is is it works really well
when you have trust and
 
when you have trust and
relationships yeah and you can have that
 
relationships yeah and you can have that
as the foundation and then it could be
 
as the foundation and then it could be
healthy transitions yeah like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
healthy transitions yeah like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
transition that hurt thean andt the
 
transition that hurt thean andt the
people involv and I don't want to like
 
people involv and I don't want to like
present duckies and rainbows and
 
present duckies and rainbows and
everything is wonderful because
 
everything is wonderful because
sometimes it's just not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] possible
 
sometimes it's just not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] possible
and and I think there is a correlation
 
and and I think there is a correlation
between the ego and or insecurity of a
 
between the ego and or insecurity of a
leader and their ability to be able to
 
leader and their ability to be able to
do that and sometimes it's not possible
 
do that and sometimes it's not possible
