come off as
 
come off as
inconclusive and a little fluffy as far
 
inconclusive and a little fluffy as far
as what that means which then means it's
 
as what that means which then means it's
pushed down to managers right and the
 
pushed down to managers right and the
feedback we've gotten is well this is
 
feedback we've gotten is well this is

frustration for those people but the

is that you know pre-co means 5 days a
 
is that you know pre-co means 5 days a
week and here's the other so there is a
 
week and here's the other so there is a
very small line about
 
very small line about
exceptions and they say he says our
 
exceptions and they say he says our
expectation is that people will be back
 
expectation is that people will be back
in the office outside of extenuating
 
in the office outside of extenuating
circumstances or if you already have a
 
circumstances or if you already have a
remote work exception approved through
 
remote work exception approved through
your s team leader so I want to talk
 
your s team leader so I want to talk
about this for a second this is the
 
about this for a second this is the
thing that I I don't think people are
 
thing that I I don't think people are
actually grocking and understanding
 
actually grocking and understanding
there are very important individual
 
there are very important individual
contributors at
 
contributors at
Amazon that have incredible agency to do
 
Amazon that have incredible agency to do
whatever the hell that they want and
 
whatever the hell that they want and
their lives aren't changing at all the
 
their lives aren't changing at all the
problem is is that everybody thinks
 
problem is is that everybody thinks
they're one of those
 
they're one of those
people and they're not just by
 
people and they're not just by
definition if you are in the top 5% of
 
definition if you are in the top 5% of
your company's uh employee population
 
your company's uh employee population
there is 95% of the other population
 
there is 95% of the other population
that is not in the top 5%
 
that is not in the top 5%
and people just don't Gro this I think
 
and people just don't Gro this I think
in our culture today there is this Aura
 
in our culture today there is this Aura
of self-importance
 
of self-importance
that isn't just
 
that isn't just
understood people don't understand where
 
understood people don't understand where
they actually are and I think a lot of
 
they actually are and I think a lot of
people feel like well that should apply
 
people feel like well that should apply
to me and I'm going to be one of those
 
to me and I'm going to be one of those
people and the reality is is it doesn't
 
people and the reality is is it doesn't
for the large majority of us it does not
 
for the large majority of us it does not
and so Amazon is is actually making a
 
and so Amazon is is actually making a
tradeoff in which they they're actually
 
tradeoff in which they they're actually
not even going to take the downside of
 
not even going to take the downside of
the trade-off because the people that
 
the trade-off because the people that
are going are not going to get
 
are going are not going to get
exceptions they are okay leaving the
 
exceptions they are okay leaving the
company there's Amazon's saying like
 
company there's Amazon's saying like
goodbye now for the top 5% they're going
 
goodbye now for the top 5% they're going
to be like oh for sure we'll give you an
 
to be like oh for sure we'll give you an
exception like no worries like don't go
 
exception like no worries like don't go
anywhere your pay is not going to change
 
anywhere your pay is not going to change
things are going to be great for you and
 
things are going to be great for you and
that's the thing that I don't think
 
that's the thing that I don't think
people understand they're just mad
 
people understand they're just mad
because it doesn't apply to everybody
 
because it doesn't apply to everybody
and you know it doesn't apply to
 
and you know it doesn't apply to
everybody that's how the world works
 
everybody that's how the world works
right and when we you say that top 5%
 
right and when we you say that top 5%
right it's subjective oh that's me
 
right it's subjective oh that's me
that's me that's me and it's interesting
 
that's me that's me and it's interesting
because I think there's a double whammy
 
because I think there's a double whammy
here on this and I love your take your
 
here on this and I love your take your
reaction to this uh you know the market
 
reaction to this uh you know the market
has changed so much in the past few
 
has changed so much in the past few
years in general we've talked about this
 
years in general we've talked about this
many times and then the pandemic gave
 
many times and then the pandemic gave
everyone the right to work remotely
 
everyone the right to work remotely
right we were all remote and the market
 
right we were all remote and the market
was hot so you know if you were not
 
was hot so you know if you were not
exceptional you might have been treated
 
exceptional you might have been treated
as exceptional when the market was
 
as exceptional when the market was
really hot and we were all at home and
 
really hot and we were all at home and
now two things are changing at the same
 
now two things are changing at the same
time not everyone is exceptional it's an
 
time not everyone is exceptional it's an
employer Market more so than not and the
 
employer Market more so than not and the
RTO pieces changing so those things are
 
RTO pieces changing so those things are
kind of compounding each other that
 
kind of compounding each other that
makes sense yeah you know I I have a I
 
makes sense yeah you know I I have a I
have a line that I used to use which is
 
have a line that I used to use which is
it feels like the Delta between employee
 
it feels like the Delta between employee
expectation and business reality is
 
expectation and business reality is
widening and you know I'm I'm actually
 
widening and you know I'm I'm actually
surprised by this because I've said this
 
surprised by this because I've said this
a million times all of us know at least
 
a million times all of us know at least
a couple of people who are phenomenal
 
a couple of people who are phenomenal
that have been having a hard time
 
that have been having a hard time
finding work in this market yes and and
 
finding work in this market yes and and
it's I just I don't understand why
 
it's I just I don't understand why
people aren't grocking that businesses
 
people aren't grocking that businesses
are also having a hard time like that's
 
are also having a hard time like that's
what that's part of the reason why our
 
what that's part of the reason why our
friends that are great can't find work
 
friends that are great can't find work
is because businesses are having a hard
 
is because businesses are having a hard
time and so businesses are having to
 
time and so businesses are having to
make hard decisions as well in order to
 
make hard decisions as well in order to
focus more on profitability and growth
 
focus more on profitability and growth
at the same time given that they have
 
at the same time given that they have
big expectations and they also have
 
big expectations and they also have
competition yes but it's your frame of
 
competition yes but it's your frame of
reference right Nolan like if I have a
 
reference right Nolan like if I have a
family and I'm trying to feed them and
 
family and I'm trying to feed them and
look for a job I'm not thinking of
 
look for a job I'm not thinking of
Amazon's heartaches as much as I'm
 
Amazon's heartaches as much as I'm
thinking about you know my own so that's
 
thinking about you know my own so that's
a human nature element in that too but
 
a human nature element in that too but
but I completely agree when you are used
 
but I completely agree when you are used
to something or you want something or
 
to something or you want something or
you feel like you're entitled to
 
you feel like you're entitled to
something or you need something the EMP
 
something or you need something the EMP
for the business is just not the same
 
for the business is just not the same
