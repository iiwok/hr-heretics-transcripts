# Amazon's Return to Office Policy

## Transcript

 
[Applause]
[Music]
what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment for HR Heretics today we
are going to talk about Amazon's RTO
policy so let me just lay the the scene
out so Andy Bassie who is Amazon CEO
wrote a letter on September 16th to the
entire company in the letter he cited
changes he wanted to to strengthen the
culture that is like the direct L um I'm
going to paraphrase uh a few notable
lines from the letter but this is the
the gist of the thing so one great
culture is not a Birthright and you have
to work at it all the time two we want
to operate like the world's greatest
startup and the sub bullet to this is
like he cited bureaucracy one of the
things I haven't seen covered in the
news as people have talked about this is
he created like this bureaucracy mailbox
for people to email if they see process
that's slowing the company down or red
tape or just that people have
to deal with that doesn't make any sense
kind of like that one um and then three
the leadership team believes that Amazon
can have better org design uh that
emphasizes more speed and ownership and
they can be more connected to each other
uh just as employees which will
emphasize invention and
collaboration so they are making two big
changes the first which again did not
get much coverage in the media is that
they're going to increase the ratio of
individual contributors to managers by
at least 15% by the end of q1 of 2025
and number two the thing that everyone's
talking about is they're going to return
to the office the way things were before
Co so Kelly dragovich what's your
take so many few things on pack here
this is a good one and we're back to RTO
Nolan I can't believe we're talking
about it I honestly I saw this again and
was like no way like I I don't want to
talk about RTO again and people can't
stop talking about it do not like
talking it's been years now um at pendo
everybody said this is my favorite topic
was like the least favorite topic that I
could ever engage in well we covered
this a while back on an episode about
the manager ratios right cutting out
more middle management having more
makers versus managers and efficiency so
that's that's a no-brainer uh I think
for me I'd love your take on this and I
I personally got a little beat up at
pendo and probably rightly so for a few
of our Communications at one point that
it just seemed very fluffy right like if
you read it it's all about the culture
the this the story and I don't really
know what the punchline was I never read
is it four days a week is it is it five
is it this it seems oh it's it's five to
me and they're having like they like
everywhere but I think Europe is having
like assigned desks again so this isn't
like you get to come in and Float like
this is five days a week at your desk
which is assigned to you I but I never
read right so my point is like this
letter if you're an Amazon employee it
doesn't actually say 5 days it says the
way it was before the pandemic and it's
up to your Este team leader so the point
I'm making is the feedback I've gotten
is a lot of these communications can
come off as
inconclusive and a little fluffy as far
as what that means which then means it's
pushed down to managers right and the
feedback we've gotten is well this is
great now it's going to land on my plate
and what if I do something different
than this manager and this team or
whatnot and it creates all sorts of
chaos so that's my first reaction do you
know what I mean what do you think about
that I I did some digging for this
segment and in 2016 Amazon had about
 
employees today they have 1.6 million so
in eight years they've added a million
net new employees that is insane like
that is absolutely crazy that's through
covid that's even post their
layoffs so look I mean Andy jasse took
over from Bezos a couple of years ago
Amazon's going through a tumultuous
times
like they they're dealing with a bunch
of Regulation problems they're getting
uh a lot of pressure from other
competitors and I think they're at a a
crucible moment in the company to where
they're looking around being like what's
our next thing what's our next ACT AWS
margins like now that's getting kind of
chewed up by other competitors so when
you make a decision like this and let's
specifically talk about RTO
First Look I think he's prepared to lose
people who aren't on
board and I think that's like it got to
be step one when you're a leader is like
look people are not going to like this
so great like that's fine for them they
can vote with their feet as we've said
many times two is is like I actually do
agree that Innovation is better had in
person you know my company setup is
fully remote and one of the things that
we do is we get together four times a
year to actually like have these moments
I wish we did it more often like at
somebody who is running a company it's
very very small we're 10 people and I
still wish we were in person more often
but we've made the trade-off to have
amazing talent and this is this is the
tradeoff we've made the trade-off to
have amazing talent anywhere in the
world specifically for us anywhere in
the United States and what Amazon saying
is is look we are no longer willing to
make that tradeoff and if you don't like
it you can vote with your feet and I
like that um I like that they're okay
saying this is who we are and what we
stand for
now the thing that I think is
challenging to some employees especially
those that have been hired in the last
few years is they were promised either
three days a week most recently or they
were promised like hey you can work
anywhere and that's that's a that's a
rug pull and and I I do feel for them um
and I I do understand like the
frustration for those people but the
thing I don't understand is like all of
these experts I think 99% of the content
that I've seen about this online is
people say it's a mistake and that it's
going to fail and that it's not going to
work and I'm just like I don't
understand where these experts are
coming from it's about a tradeoff
decision and they're willing to make the
tradeoff that says look we don't care
about the person who's working you know
in BFE anymore we expect them to be in
the office and if they don't come in the
office like that's okay with us I think
this whole thing like who who are these
experts I think that's a farce how can
you be an expert on this there's not a
lot of hindsight to to grab on to and to
your point that we've always said this
Clarity first and it will work if you're
clear on on on what you are and what
you're not you're going to go through it
there's pros and cons to anything but if
it's clear you can manage through it and
it will work somehow some way when it
doesn't work it's very fuzzy right when
you have different rules for different
situations and this and that and that
was my original point and what gave me a
lot of Heartache around this when I was
an operating role is the Judgment part
the gray areas of this this when you
have that many employees and it came off
as a little fuzzy to me that was my my
only point and maybe underneath that
letter there is a ton of clarity written
down around what what this is what the
rules are Etc I'm just saying when it's
fuzzy and then you give managers Este
team leaders discretion on some of this
stuff you can get a lot of conflict in
the system Nolan right hey everyone

Heretics Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
FL and check out medavie head over to
metav view. a/h Heretics to talk to one
of metav View's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled admin
so here here's the way I read it Kelly
is that you know pre-co means 5 days a
week and here's the other so there is a
very small line about
exceptions and they say he says our
expectation is that people will be back
in the office outside of extenuating
circumstances or if you already have a
remote work exception approved through
your s team leader so I want to talk
about this for a second this is the
thing that I I don't think people are
actually grocking and understanding
there are very important individual
contributors at
Amazon that have incredible agency to do
whatever the hell that they want and
their lives aren't changing at all the
problem is is that everybody thinks
they're one of those
people and they're not just by
definition if you are in the top 5% of
your company's uh employee population
there is 95% of the other population
that is not in the top 5%
and people just don't Gro this I think
in our culture today there is this Aura
of self-importance
that isn't just
understood people don't understand where
they actually are and I think a lot of
people feel like well that should apply
to me and I'm going to be one of those
people and the reality is is it doesn't
for the large majority of us it does not
and so Amazon is is actually making a
tradeoff in which they they're actually
not even going to take the downside of
the trade-off because the people that
are going are not going to get
exceptions they are okay leaving the
company there's Amazon's saying like
goodbye now for the top 5% they're going
to be like oh for sure we'll give you an
exception like no worries like don't go
anywhere your pay is not going to change
things are going to be great for you and
that's the thing that I don't think
people understand they're just mad
because it doesn't apply to everybody
and you know it doesn't apply to
everybody that's how the world works
right and when we you say that top 5%
right it's subjective oh that's me
that's me that's me and it's interesting
because I think there's a double whammy
here on this and I love your take your
reaction to this uh you know the market
has changed so much in the past few
years in general we've talked about this
many times and then the pandemic gave
everyone the right to work remotely
right we were all remote and the market
was hot so you know if you were not
exceptional you might have been treated
as exceptional when the market was
really hot and we were all at home and
now two things are changing at the same
time not everyone is exceptional it's an
employer Market more so than not and the
RTO pieces changing so those things are
kind of compounding each other that
makes sense yeah you know I I have a I
have a line that I used to use which is
it feels like the Delta between employee
expectation and business reality is
widening and you know I'm I'm actually
surprised by this because I've said this
a million times all of us know at least
a couple of people who are phenomenal
that have been having a hard time
finding work in this market yes and and
it's I just I don't understand why
people aren't grocking that businesses
are also having a hard time like that's
what that's part of the reason why our
friends that are great can't find work
is because businesses are having a hard
time and so businesses are having to
make hard decisions as well in order to
focus more on profitability and growth
at the same time given that they have
big expectations and they also have
competition yes but it's your frame of
reference right Nolan like if I have a
family and I'm trying to feed them and
look for a job I'm not thinking of
Amazon's heartaches as much as I'm
thinking about you know my own so that's
a human nature element in that too but
but I completely agree when you are used
to something or you want something or
you feel like you're entitled to
something or you need something the EMP
for the business is just not the same
and it'll be very interesting to see
what happens with this you know to your
point of will it work or not I can't I
can't wait to see will people leave are
they going to get pushed out I mean the
the proof is in the pudding and that's
my point is when all these molecules
start bumping into each other over the
next coming months that's where the
rubber hits the road not at this high
level letter yeah I I I believe what
will happen here is what happens with
all of these like contentious decisions
in which people get really worked up
over it for a couple of weeks the new
stasis gets established and then it's
like great Amazon's a 5ay a week
workplace and we don't ever talk about
it again and they keep operating um and
probably operating you know with the
trade-offs that they know that they're
they're going to make going into it the
last thing I'll say on this topic Kelly
is one of my former CEOs uh had this
line and he said if you don't like it
you can start a company and make those
decisions he said that to me one time
when I was complaining about something
and it it kind of took me a back in the
moment but I I've since processed it and
thought about it and I I have done that
and it it does turn out that like look
if you are unhappy you can vote with
your feet but this is a tough job market
and it's it's tough to find exactly what
you want in today's world yep go listen
to the founder mode episode we talked
about this voting with your feet and
being clear the position you're in and
what you think and what you can change
and what you can't and what you can put
up with 100% yep so that's what I got um
let us know what you guys think about
this one uh we'll keep covering these
