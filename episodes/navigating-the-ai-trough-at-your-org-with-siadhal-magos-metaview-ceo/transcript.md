# Navigating the AI Trough At Your Org with Siadhal Magos, Metaview CEO

## Transcript

What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
are doing our AI corner with the CEO of
Metav View, Style Magos. As Kelly said,
Styles's flow is looking amazing today.
Style, it's good to see you, man.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, hair tips
available in the comments. So, enjoy.
&gt;&gt; It is.
I asked him if he woke up like that.
Looks incredible. And for those of you
who don't know, flow means hair. I did
not know that. So, here we go.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's me speaking in millennial, I
think. I think it's still millennial
term there. Um, so s we're going to talk
today about AI sourcing. Um, and so you
and I had a conversation. I think it was
probably like February, March time
frame, and we were talking about the
metav roadmap. And, uh, we were having a
a very, you know, polite debate. And I
remember, uh, if I recall correctly,
being like, I think you should do AI
sourcing because everybody wants it and
there really hasn't been a good solution
up to this point. So, since then, you
guys built this thing in like 6 months.
Uh, which like huge hat tip to your
founder. I think he might be the better
founder of the two, just me speaking.
Um, but anyways, you guys get this thing
out and now it feels like it was
supposed to be in beta, but like the
world is like ripping it from your
hands. So, give us the rundown of like
why you guys decided to prioritize this.
Um, where you're at in the development
cycle, what you're learning from
customers, and then ideally, we'd love
to see a demo so we can get in there and
figure out what's going on. So yeah, I
mean folks have uh many folks have
mentioned to us that AI sourcing might
be a you know an AI truly AI native
sourcing solution might be something
that's worth experiencing which I guess
a Nolan don't give yourself too much
credit on that front like it's been top
of many people's minds and B is
obviously a really big signal to someone
like me because it tells me people
aren't satisfied with what is out there
which is obviously you know exactly why
we exist right when I when I think about
the question that we ask ourselves every
day it's really how are humans and AI
going to work together to build teams
and So we have this great note toker
product. We have a bunch of data
analytics tools on top of that convers
the hiring conversational data. But for
us it's always been about soup to nuts.
How can we help the people who are
obsessing over building their teams do
it with that Iron Man suit on with AI at
their fingertips? And sourcing has just
always been been sort of very high on
the list. And then you have a couple of
other sort of like compounding factors.
One is that people were actually using
MetaView for sourcing in like a quite a
core use case already. So if you think
about some of our longerterm customers,
folks who've been with us for maybe
three years by this point, they have
thousands and thousands of conversations
with thousands of different candidates
and when they're trying to fill really
hard to fill roles, they would often go
to MetaView and ask the AI, hey, has
anyone else in the company spoke to
someone who has XYZ? And so we were
already seeing this emerging use case of
people, you know, wanting to leverage
both, you know, our our world-class AI
but also their their own data. And then
the third thing was things beyond our
control, which is really we talked a
little bit in the past about browser use
and computer use on this on this pod.
The fact that AI can now essentially use
the same tools that humans can use, that
is a really really big shift because
essentially anything that you're doing
that is like heavily fingers on keyboard
work is work that you're going to start
to do with AI. And I I would put all
these folks like Lovable and Vzero and
all of these sort of vibe coding tools
in that bucket. This is work you're
doing fingers on keyboard. It's not a
human-toum interaction. You're going to
do that with AI. So this sort of like
vibe coding um explosion that you've
seen over the last year was also really
telling for us because we're like hey
listen if people who are building
products, building experiences, building
websites have this really intuitive way
to essentially demystify the product
building process using AI. Is that not
also going to be true in recruiting? And
if so where is that going to be? And we
think it's most likely sourcing because
that's the most sort of fingers on
keyboard doing the sort of the sometimes
the dirty work of just finding finding
profiles. So, uh, that was the big
reason. Um, summarize, I guess C, we
knew customers needed it and we thought
the time was now for like a technical
reason that that made it make sense.
&gt;&gt; Yep. So, we could call this Vibe
recruiting then maybe.
&gt;&gt; I think we should go VIP sourcing for
now. For now, I think we're going to
we're going to draw the line at sourcing
and uh we'll see if we can get to the
rest of recruiting over time.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, uh so then you guys launched
the beta thing like I don't know what,
couple weeks ago. Um, and then all of a
sudden now we're like in GA, which I you
and I are supposed to be having this
event like next week to like do like the
formal announcement and then like that
got moved up.
&gt;&gt; So like why what's going on?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically the first um now much
as AI sourcing or sourcing with AI is
going to be a thing. There's other
companies that are doing somewhat
interesting things as well. Um, one of
the sort of the massive advantages we
have almost natively to our platform is
we can do what's called promptless
sourcing. So most most of the time when
you want to source for someone, you as
the like the human, you need to turn up
and have like the activation energy and
you need to think, well, what am I going
to tell the AI that I want so that it
can go and do some sourcing for you. Um,
in Metav's case, we have this really
cool situation where we're often hearing
those conversations like upstream of
that action. So an example would be
let's say um I'm a recruiter and I meet
with a hiring manager and the hiring
manager is telling me I'm looking I need
someone to fill this role. They need to
be XYZ. MetView is already in that
conversation and so for the last 3
months or so we've been having our AI
sourcing agent which is in beta
proactively going to find candidates off
the back of that conversation and so we
had this sort of ever growing number of
customers that were realizing if they
have a meeting and they discuss the type
of candidate they're looking for
Metivview is going to go and find them
some people and so it's a really like
magical experience. It's a big part of
the product we're launching now is this
really cool promptless sourcing. Um but
what that resulted in was some people
basically sharing this publicly like hey
look at this magical thing that Metav
started to do. Um and at first we just
thought that was hey you know we weren't
like super surprised by it I guess but
then we realized
uh I guess that stuff really spread
quite quickly and we needed like a more
of a thoughtful posture on what are we
doing here? Uh sorry not our posture was
already thoughtful. What I mean is we
needed to have like very clear
communication with the market about what
this was and so we just brought the
launch of it forward. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. Metav is the
AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metave suite of AI agents works for you
at every stage of the hiring process.
Their platform powers instant job postc
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metav changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Just head over to metaviv.ai/heretics

product experts or get started for free.
You'll be uprun and AI enabled in
minutes.
&gt;&gt; So, I've used this um and I I you know,
I think it's sick because when you say
promptless, I don't think people
actually understand like what that
means. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, can you show us the demo? And if you
guys are listening, this is where like
you should tune in to to YouTube or the
Substack page because Styles's about to
give a sweet demo here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And while you're pulling that up,
I I I love the simplicity of that sle.
Like I would explain it to someone like
listen I wouldn't even say prompt list
because again I've told you guys this. I
think there's a bunch of confusion given
the semantics we use in this industry in
this world. But it's kind of having it's
like having an agent on your team. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's with you in meetings and is
proactive and can take action on behalf
of just being a part of the meeting.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Which is cool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Totally.
In this case, I'm just I'm not going to
show you one of the promptless versions
anyway. I'm just going to show you the
sort of the vibe vibe sourcingesque uh
example. Can you folks see my screen?
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cool. So, um this is what the um
the sourcing product looks like. Very
deliberately looks quite similar to if
you've used Chat GPT obviously, which
I'm sure everyone has, but also same
thing if you've used Lovable, Vzero,
these type of AI coding products. And
very simple question. What kind of
person are you looking for? So note that
this is not a like be super thoughtful
about what filters to apply. It really
just encourages you to throw whatever
context you have at the AI and let it
figure out how to find these people. So
in this case, I'm going to give it a um
uh I want to find more AES. So I'm going
to give it this prompt. I want to hire
more AEES. I love my current team. So
there are some résumés attached. So like
to find more like them. I've also
attached the job description. uh feel
free to ask me a couple of questions in
order to home in on exactly what it is I
like about them so your search is
precise. So let me just add these uh
resumes and whatnot real quick.
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting prompt style.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, thank you.
Um,
&gt;&gt; well, I don't usually ask like when I it
it's worth taking a beat because like I
don't usually like end the prompt with
like feel free to ask me questions in
order to hone in. Like I'm I'm curious
to see how like the AI responds with
that because that is not part of my
current workflow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Well, and and also to be
honest with you, it's not required. I
think we'll talk about the I'll share
the reason I did it in a second. But the
reality is the cool thing about what I
did here as far the feedback we're
getting from customers is a lot of the
time when you understand what you're
looking for in a candidate, it's
actually quite fuzzy in your like to be
able to articulate it is almost half the
problem. So what I'm really doing here
is I'm giving it a very like high level
almost emotion. I want my more people. I
love my current team. Here they are.
Like that's actually where the starting
point for many people. And so what I
think Vibe when you think about what
Vibe coding is or what Vibe sourcing is,
Vibe working of any description, you're
essentially moving from a world where
you do the you used to have to do a lot
of the upfront thought in order to get a
machine to do something. You'd have to
think very specifically about what you
want it to do. That's no that when
you're vibe sourcing, vibe coding,
that's no longer the case. You just tell
it what you want and let it sort of
figure it out from there and make it
easy for you. So in this case, I've I've
told it it can ask me three questions.
Uh it's asked me um what's your ideal
experience level? So let me answer that
for it real quick. Ideal experience
level is two to four years closing. Uh
the second question is um would you
someone consider someone who crushed at
a more established company but hasn't
been in the trenches? I'm going to say
prefer early stage
unless
top tier high growth
scale up. So this is and the reason this
is really cool again you know hopefully
this is obvious is usually when you're
using another sort of like noni native
non-agentic sourcing tool you would have
to like pick your bullseye companies
you'd have to actually like name them
and that's just work. like I don't I I'm
going from this thought I have which is
I love early stage or top tier
companies. I might have to do two
separate searches for that. I'm just
asking the AI to figure it out for me.
And then geo priorities I'm going to say
SF and London uh only. Um cool. So AI
has got itself a little bit the agent
has got itself a little bit more
information from me. And what you sort
of would typically see with you know
non-aggentic AI solutions here is it
would probably just like apply that as a
bunch of filters to a database. Now, the
great thing about that is that it can be
quite quick. The downside to that is
often you get huge sort of sways of
candidates or actually none at all
because no one matches those filters
that you've applied. What's actually
going to happen here is Metaview is
going to come up with a plan for me um
or a plan for itself actually in order
to uh find the candidates that that
match this. So, we're going to give it
one like a few more seconds to come up
with its plan and then I'll I'll show
you again this this really sort of
frankly like novel and AI native way
that I can work with the AI on on on
this sourcing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. One of the things that you taught
me that I have had to it's like a
behavior change in the way that I work
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; is that we just need to let AI run while
we go do other things.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. I I think the way that I was used
to working was like, okay, I sit down,
I'm ready to source, and so like, I'm
going to go do all of these things, and
by the time that I'm done in my time
block, which say it was like an hour and
a half,
&gt;&gt; then it's like, okay, great. I want to
have 50 profiles, which is typically
what I'm trying to do.
&gt;&gt; You taught me, Nolan, when you're doing
this, you need to just go do something
else
&gt;&gt; while the AI works in the background.
&gt;&gt; That that I think is like a big behavior
change for people. And I think it's
actually a new skill acquisition because
you know generally humans suck at
multitasking.
And so what I've started to do is like
as I get into this I'm writing down like
other like yes this is my core task for
what I'd like to do for the next 90
minutes. But while the AI is working
here's like the two to three minute task
that I can go bang out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Which is a it's kind of like it's a big
mind shift. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; For me because otherwise you're just
sitting here waiting and being
unproductive. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, let me show you I'll show
you another sort of interpret another
thing you can do with that that time,
which is essentially you can get many AI
agents working at once. You can I still
think you can focus on the same task
like hey, I'm sourcing right now. Okay,
I'll spin up an agent for this. I'll
spin up an agent for this, spin up an
agent for this. These could be different
sourcing strategies maybe um in this
case to sort of and I do think a lot of
this is a user experience innovation.
So, what you're seeing now is the AI's
first job that it's given itself is to
create an ideal candidate profile. So
what you're seeing here is like a pretty
lengthy document actually which is
essentially the AI turning my rough
prompt which is you know just hey I love
these guys let's hire more like them and
then giving the resumes into its
synthesis of what is special and unique
about these people so it can work on
those instructions instead. Um and
there's a couple of again really fun
things here. One you'll see there's a
timer ticking down. The idea here is kn
say you did decide hey I'm just going to
put this prompt in then I'm going to go
away and do something else. It would
it's not going to wait for me forever.
It's going to just give me a couple of
minutes just in case it's got something
wrong before it goes and does the
search. Um, but I can really sort of
edit this however I want. In this case,
I'm going to say it looks good and and
we can go for it. Um, now while it's
doing that, I'm going to show you what I
would do in this situation because I
know now it's going to probably take
about 3 minutes to find my first batch
of candidates. Here is I actually have
another search strategy in mind. So, I
don't need to sit here and watch this,
right? Because this is not me actively
applying the filters. The AI agent is
going and manipulating this in the back
end. I'm going to go and start a new
search and this time I've got a slightly
different thing which is um I have this
theory basically that uh well it's not a
theory it's obvious YC is an amazing
incubator pretty much any founder that
goes through YC is going to have their
head screwed on like the majority is
going to have their head screwed on and
probably pretty able to hire uh great
AES now that doesn't change the fact
that most YC companies fail right so you
got this great you frequently having
great people coming back onto the
market. So my other theory here that I
want to source based on which is really
almost impossible to do unless you have
an agent is I want to find people that
are used to that used to be AES at
recent YC back companies. You'll be able
to spot these companies as they almost
always have YC in their batch code in
the company name. I give it an example
of what that means. Um only interested
people that have been at these companies
in YC 2022 or later and so on. So
essentially this sort of again almost
like a hypothesis I have about what a
great candidate might look like. the AI
can understand without me having to
think how do I almost break that down
into some specific filters on top of a
database. Um so again I think like very
equivalent to vibe coding where you used
to almost have to know how to get the
machine to do the thing that you want it
to do. Um and some of those things were
really hard. Now actually you sort of
don't really need to know uh exactly how
to make this happen. You just need to
tell the AI and the AI can figure it
out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. the the coding analog by the way
for sourcing was boolean strengths.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Which like for me like literally I've
been doing recruiting for 15 years and I
always looked at boolean strings and I
was like this is the dumbest thing and I
like
&gt;&gt; totally
&gt;&gt; I never learned it. I there was like
some like Chrome thing of like like help
me create a boolean string sort of a
thing that I was using. It always felt
like just the worst user experience for
anybody doing sourcing.
&gt;&gt; Totally. and and like I mean but that's
sort of why I'm using this example
because even like a boolean master would
struggle to encapsulate what I just said
there just in natural language was
people who used to be at recent YC
companies like that's like actually a
pretty tough thing to to to create a
boolean for whereas Metiv's come up with
its own instructions and it's going to
go ahead and do that for me. I'm going
to jump back to the other search now. So
I'm back in the the AEES based on my my
favorite AES here and like this is
actually a really cool example. So um uh
you'll see it started to do a bunch of
things. It started to search. It gives
you it its reasoning trail. So very
similar to chat GBC agent or claude,
whatever you're using, it tells you what
it's been working on. This is really
useful for a couple of reasons. Again,
I'm still orchestrating this, right?
This is not like flying blind as a
recruiter. This is I'm seeing what this
AI is doing and I'm able to say, well,
it looks like you went wrong here.
What's really cool is it started to
search for Londonbased AES and it
actually made a mistake. I see that I'm
getting many results from London,
Ontario, Canada, and also many PR and
advertising AES rather than SAS B2B AES.
Let me refine my search to get better
quality candidates. So, I'm not saying
that it's admirable that our AI agent
made that mistake because obviously it,
you know, frankly, it shouldn't. What I
am saying is it's admirable that it has
frankly the intelligence to realize I'm
making a mistake. I need to go and do
something different. And I think this is
a great example of really what the
switch over to truly agentic workflows
results in. like you are moving some of
your the thoughts can happen by these
LLMs that are just getting smarter and
smarter all the time and obviously it's
job it's the job of company companies
like ours to make sure it it obviously
ends up in the right place um
yeah it's mentioning it's got some
strong fits let me continue searching
for more candidates to build a pool
that's aiming for a pool of 50 um and
it's going to search more strategically
for startups and specific company types
essentially what's happening here is the
AI agent the AI sourcing agent has a
bunch of tools that we've built for it
under the hood be that searching across
various database of companies but also
candidates. It can also use a browser in
the back end as well and it uses all
these different tools in different ways
to get me my my my candidates and it
will yeah it will it will land us a few
any moment now. So, it feels like what
this is starting, while this is working,
it feels like what this is starting to
enable is anybody to be a worldclass
sorcerer. Like I, you know, I have a ton
of friends who have been just like elite
sorcerers. It's like their deal, right?
Like they go off into like, you know,
these coding tools and coding platforms
and they're like looking on the message
boards for like who's commenting and
like pulling all their Like that
for me was like very low energy work.
Like I do I do not like doing that sort
of internet sleuththing and research.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Now the agents doing this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so like the enabling feature here is
for people like me, people like Kelly,
founders, hiring managers, if you want
to do your own sourcing now and you want
to do it really really well, you are no
longer constrained by having an amazing
sourcer. Is that would you say that's
fair and accurate?
&gt;&gt; Yes is the answer. The people that we've
seen the most immediate love for the
product are full cycle recruiters.
People who essentially sometimes rely on
inbound because they have it as opposed
to thinking well I should really grind
and do some sourcing now because you
know they want to focus more on getting
to know the candidates and these sorts
of things which is totally
understandable. So the three like full
cycle recruiters absolutely love it
because it's essentially like having
your sourcing done for you but you're
still in control right it's not just a
random batch of like you know it's much
easier to calibrate the AI frankly than
it is uh a sourcer on your team. you get
much quicker feedback loops. And the
other folks who really love it actually
are founders. We've had a lot of it's
not really the main target market for
the product. But founders absolutely
love it because they spend, you know,
hours and hours per day, as you say,
like sleuththing on the internet to find
people. Um, like I could I won't
interrupt it now because I don't want
to, but I could even tell it to, you
know, browse the web and find an article
of the 50 most hottest upand cominging
companies and then find candidates from,
you know, those companies who have been
there for at least four years. you know,
whatever I whatever I sort of think
might be a cool um like angle of vector
of attack for finding the candidates
that I want. Just like I could ask a
human sourcer to go and do those things
because it has access to the tools, I
can ask the AI agent to do it as well.
Yeah. And one thing you'll notice is
it's giving me live commentary of what's
going on, which is also, you know, which
is obviously very cool. I found a good
pool of London candidates. Let me get
some profiles for some of the most
promising ones. Let me evaluate the
candidates I've collected so far to
select the top 50. So it's almost in a
way it's you know frankly on many
dimensions better than asking a human to
do it because you have this audit you
know exactly even if this candidate set
of candidates I get now is no good I'm
going to know exactly why it ended I'm
going to be able to interrogate and say
well why did you why did you land with
these people now that's not going to
happen I think they're going to be a
pretty strong batch because I've given
it a good prompt but the fact that you
can see the whole reasoning trail is
great for performance but also if you're
looking for example we've had great
comments around um you know, folks that
want a more diverse pipeline, for
example, you don't know how if you're
sourcing for candidates, you don't
really know, you can't really
interrogate the human who got these
candidates into your pipeline for like
why you chose them. Uh you can actually
interrogate the AI for exactly that.
&gt;&gt; This is so cool. I can see why founders,
even folks like me, use this. I mean,
it's just so easy to do self-service
now, right? I mean, you can essentially
spread out the recruiting
responsibilities. Everyone can recruit
with this because it's easy. I think the
other like mindset shift for me that you
mentioned earlier Nolan with like the
way that we work is just how natural
this can be. You know, like even like 6
months ago in my mind it was like work
with AI and it's kind of robotic. You
have to be very precise in what you
want. If you don't have the perfect
prompts, you're going to get a shitty
response. Like just the easy thing you
said, hey, go find the top 50 companies.
Hey, go find me someone that you know if
if they were part of a great scaleup
company. It's just so natural and that's
not how
&gt;&gt; it's more human like you know contrary
to like it's like actually more human to
do it this way. this before you get into
this next piece. The other thing that
comes to me is like it feels now like
the primary constraint in sourcing like
spec like for this use case is just kind
of like your creativity and your in your
prompting like you know you're saying
things about I'm like taking notes as
you're writing because I'm like
like I'm doing sourcing right now. I'm
like YC companies is a really good idea.
&gt;&gt; Uh like I'm looking for like a founding
recruiter like huh maybe I should just
like start. So I feel like that is now
one of the primary constraints is
actually like is our prompting creative
enough like can we go different paths
with our prompting such that like it
will continue to source new profiles for
us.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Totally. So here's here I've
got some results. So basically what
happened here is I got my first batch of
candidates back. I actually wasn't sure
on the quality initially or not maybe
not quality but what how these people
got here. So I asked the AI to please
share a table of for me with how you
picked these people. And so it literally
creates a CSV for me and it visualizes
it for me as well where it tells me how
it chose these people. And you'll see
one of the things here in the columns
it's got is are they an early sales
hire? Yes or no. Do they have HR
recruiting tech? Yes or no. Do they have
awards and recognition based on their
profile? Have they been promoted fast?
Which I didn't specifically tell it to
do. It just pulled that from my existing
people that that seems to be a common
theme.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Um and that's great. So I like that
rationale. But actually to be honest,
MetaView does not we don't really rotate
that strong around selling having
previously sold HR tech. So I said to it
actually you've over rotated on being an
HR tech. So this is like a very common
this is like this is the type of
feedback that would probably take you
like 3 days to realize that you're
miscalibrated with a human sourcer. Like
oh damn, you've brought all these people
that have HR tech which is great. I I'm
interested but like my universe is
bigger than that. So I told it don't
rotate on that early sales hire and
their trajectory are more important. So
it went away and did a second pass and
found me this, you know, frankly more
appropriate for me batch of candidates.
Um, and this is where the AI really
starts to become your own because much
as I've given it this prompt, the
reality is where the rubber meets the
road is me giving feedback on
candidates, the calibration process. And
so the way we've built this is that
every single time it I'm presented a
candidate, I can say whether I think
they're a fit, yes or no. and it all
constantly adds that to that ideal
candidate profile. So, it's constantly
tuning its understanding of what good
looks like for this role. And over time,
we'll start to create almost a
companywide level of understanding of
what good looks like because you're
constantly getting this feedback from
every recruiter, every hiring manager of
like, was this person actually what we
were looking for? And you'll start to
notice these these really cool really
cool trends. So this yeah this
collaboration step is super important
for really building an AI agent that
frankly understands you which is where
you as an operator get an unfair
advantage right if if you actually have
an AI agent that is finding the best
candidates that you would otherwise take
days and days to find as opposed to just
what seem on the surface what you know
any random recruiter would find then
that's where you got a huge a huge
advantage
&gt;&gt; sle how is this possible like you know
with LinkedIn so I I remember Rahul
Vora's company way back in the day that
was like they were scraping LinkedIn and
then I think they got like shut down.
&gt;&gt; How like how are you able to do this?
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; With like the LinkedIn constraints and
their terms of service.
&gt;&gt; There's lots of um databases are
publicly available Canada. So the the
same databases that frankly a lot of
folks want to be using whether you're
using Gem or um you know Apollo on the
sales side. All of these folks, there's
data brokers, data platforms that have
this data. So, this is not a unique data
play at all. There's nothing unique
about the candidates. You will not find
candidates on Metaview that sort of
don't exist on these other platforms.
What this is about is uh the apparatus
you have to get the LLM to understand
what you're looking for so that it can
do the navigation and traversing of that
database. That's all this is. This is
not like a there's no database
innovation here.
&gt;&gt; That's super. That's a great way to
frame it, right? Because it's like,
you're right, like there's so many of
these data providers. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Everyone's like every everyone has
access to the data now. It doesn't feel
like that's like a unique moat anymore.
&gt;&gt; Now, what's really interesting is is
like how easy can I find the people that
I want as if I was talking to you about
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Although the thing I would maybe
add to that understand I'm just share my
screen again because I think there's an
important there's another important
point here is yes it's definitely true
the data is not this data is not um like
a differentiator let's say for for this
approach it's just about creating an
environment that the agent can search
against it what but what we what you
what another thing that does having an
agent does enable you to do is to point
it at whatever database you want. So,
for example, right now our our agent
just browses the web to find people, but
actually soon you'll be able to also
essentially almost give it a a presence
on your ATS and say, "Listen, I bet I
bet you there's some good candidates in
our ATS as well. Please go and search
our ATS for these people." Uh, and
that's like obviously a different data
structure, but just as you as a human
can understand how you know the web or
LinkedIn looks different to your ATS, an
AI agent can as well. So, we're going to
give it that tool. And same thing with
MetaView. might say, "Well, actually go
and look through all of my conversations
and find these people and like up, you
know, further enrich any profiles you
find based on what else we know about
them." So again, this is when you really
start to think about AI essentially
representing intelligence on tap, you
will like you can really start to reimag
uh a lot of this work and almost stop
this siloing of well, I need to go here
for this thing and here for this thing.
Like that's the AI's job. The AI's job
is to figure out where to go for what
and to learn to navigate that tool and
which button to click and all of that
 That's not your job. Your job is
to make sure you're sort of calibrated
with the hiring manager and know what
great looks like. Provide an amazing
experience to that candidate when you
are frankly like lucky enough to get
them to spend time with you. Like that
is where the whole game is going to be.
Not this, hey, I'm really proficient at
writing boolean and therefore searching
this and then I also know how to set up,
you know, yeah, sequences on this thing.
The AI agents are going to do that for
you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love the idea of searching the
ATS. Yeah, the ATS is like they've
already indicated interest in your
company, right? Right now, the ATS is
the place where resumes go to die
because nobody looks at them because
there's just too many. Um, and it's
like, you know, cold outbound becomes
the default for every recruiter, which
is the hardest way to engage a
candidate.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um, style, what's like what's coming
next? Right. So like that you there's
like you now have two legit legit
products.
&gt;&gt; How are you thinking about like
prioritizing like as a user of MetaView
&gt;&gt; cuz like I want to make sure you guys
still keep pumping cool
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's there's there's
that uh I guess it's a scaling challenge
or like an a great opportunity we have
to like meet this scaling challenge
which is the bar is also continually
rising on the existing product. So
there's more we got to do on sourcing
for sure. So there's a ton to whether
that's in integration with other
databases like proprietary databases
that you own as a customer that you want
your agent to be able to navigate like
your ATS like MetaView even another
noteaker. I I like I think again this is
you have to like commit to the new
paradigm that's emerging like I don't
actually care if you don't use meta view
as your noteaker. I still want our
sourcing agent to be able to check your
noteaker conversations for candidates
that might be great right we anyway. So,
so there's a bunch around the
integrations um and actually getting
these candidates in your pipeline. Um
and then the other is around as I mean
it's an extension on the ATS but like a
true like first class experience for
these application reviews um uh is also
super exciting to us. So the way we
think about it maybe to answer the sort
of the top level question of how do we
think about this is um the mix of what
are people spending a lot of time doing
especially if that work is undifferiated
and you know if someone else did it the
next day it wouldn't be hella different
and what are the things that literally
the sort of the bleeding edge of AI
makes it now possible to do do something
different with like there's no point in
spending time on things that humans
spend a lot of time on that actually AI
is a poor sort of um is
it can only poorly imitate. But if
there's there's actually a series of
things where truly AI will do it better,
like much as that may sting in some
cases for some people, that's like
clearly where the puck is going. Uh then
that's the stuff that we think is like
very mission aligned for us to work on.
&gt;&gt; Gangster, I love it, man. Uh can people
still just ping you directly on LinkedIn
and say like, "Give me a free trial. I
want to go try this right now."
&gt;&gt; You can check it out if anyone can check
it out. Just go to just go to the
website and click on metab.ai AI and
click on uh try sourcing for free. Yeah,
we went through this uh really cool we
did this experiment which we're going to
continue to do actually which was I just
put out a post saying hey I'm I'm here
to do some sourcing like just let me
know. Um and obviously I didn't tell
them I was going to be using uh AI agent
in the background was just like showing
off almost the capability and so I had
like 12 people ask me to go and find
people. I get back to the mall in like 5
minutes. It was like uh pretty magical.
&gt;&gt; That's sick man.
&gt;&gt; That's cool.
&gt;&gt; Congrats on all the progress. We'll talk
to you soon.
&gt;&gt; Congrats.
