other sort of like compounding factors.
other sort of like compounding factors.
 
other sort of like compounding factors.
One is that people were actually using

One is that people were actually using
MetaView for sourcing in like a quite a
MetaView for sourcing in like a quite a
 
MetaView for sourcing in like a quite a
core use case already. So if you think
core use case already. So if you think
 
core use case already. So if you think
about some of our longerterm customers,
about some of our longerterm customers,
 
about some of our longerterm customers,
folks who've been with us for maybe
folks who've been with us for maybe
 
folks who've been with us for maybe
three years by this point, they have
three years by this point, they have
 
three years by this point, they have
thousands and thousands of conversations
thousands and thousands of conversations
 
thousands and thousands of conversations
with thousands of different candidates
with thousands of different candidates
 
with thousands of different candidates
and when they're trying to fill really
and when they're trying to fill really
 
and when they're trying to fill really
hard to fill roles, they would often go
hard to fill roles, they would often go
 
hard to fill roles, they would often go
to MetaView and ask the AI, hey, has
to MetaView and ask the AI, hey, has
 
to MetaView and ask the AI, hey, has
anyone else in the company spoke to
anyone else in the company spoke to
 
anyone else in the company spoke to
someone who has XYZ? And so we were
someone who has XYZ? And so we were
 
someone who has XYZ? And so we were
already seeing this emerging use case of

already seeing this emerging use case of
people, you know, wanting to leverage
people, you know, wanting to leverage
 
people, you know, wanting to leverage
both, you know, our our world-class AI
both, you know, our our world-class AI

but also their their own data. And then
but also their their own data. And then

the third thing was things beyond our
the third thing was things beyond our
 
the third thing was things beyond our
control, which is really we talked a

The fact that AI can now essentially use
The fact that AI can now essentially use
 
The fact that AI can now essentially use
the same tools that humans can use, that
the same tools that humans can use, that
 
the same tools that humans can use, that
is a really really big shift because
is a really really big shift because
 
is a really really big shift because
essentially anything that you're doing
essentially anything that you're doing
 
essentially anything that you're doing
that is like heavily fingers on keyboard
that is like heavily fingers on keyboard
 
that is like heavily fingers on keyboard
work is work that you're going to start
work is work that you're going to start
 
work is work that you're going to start
to do with AI. And I I would put all
to do with AI. And I I would put all
 
to do with AI. And I I would put all
these folks like Lovable and Vzero and
these folks like Lovable and Vzero and
 
these folks like Lovable and Vzero and
all of these sort of vibe coding tools
all of these sort of vibe coding tools
 
all of these sort of vibe coding tools
in that bucket. This is work you're

do that with AI. So this sort of like
do that with AI. So this sort of like
 
do that with AI. So this sort of like
vibe coding um explosion that you've
vibe coding um explosion that you've
 
vibe coding um explosion that you've
seen over the last year was also really
seen over the last year was also really

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically the first um now much
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically the first um now much
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically the first um now much
as AI sourcing or sourcing with AI is
as AI sourcing or sourcing with AI is
 
as AI sourcing or sourcing with AI is
going to be a thing. There's other
going to be a thing. There's other
 
going to be a thing. There's other
companies that are doing somewhat
companies that are doing somewhat
 
companies that are doing somewhat
interesting things as well. Um, one of
interesting things as well. Um, one of

and have like the activation energy and
 
and have like the activation energy and
you need to think, well, what am I going
you need to think, well, what am I going
 
you need to think, well, what am I going
to tell the AI that I want so that it
to tell the AI that I want so that it
 
to tell the AI that I want so that it
can go and do some sourcing for you. Um,
can go and do some sourcing for you. Um,
 
can go and do some sourcing for you. Um,
in Metav's case, we have this really
in Metav's case, we have this really
 
in Metav's case, we have this really
cool situation where we're often hearing
cool situation where we're often hearing
 
cool situation where we're often hearing
those conversations like upstream of
those conversations like upstream of
 
those conversations like upstream of
that action. So an example would be
that action. So an example would be

uh I guess that stuff really spread
uh I guess that stuff really spread
 
uh I guess that stuff really spread
quite quickly and we needed like a more
quite quickly and we needed like a more
