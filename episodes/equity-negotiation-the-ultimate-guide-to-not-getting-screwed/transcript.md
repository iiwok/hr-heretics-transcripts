Hey everybody. A few weeks ago, we're
started bringing back some Essential
Heretics 101 content. Today, we're
revealing insider secrets of equity
negotiation that could save you millions
of dollars. Colleen McCreary recommended
this in her episode earlier this week
and it's one of our most important
conversations yet. All right, what's up
everybody? Welcome back to another
segment of HR Heretics. We are going to
bring back Dear Heretics and here we go,
Kelly. So, Dear Heretics, I'm
embarrassed to admit this as an HR
leader, but I just don't feel confident
or smart when it comes to equity. I
recently went through a new job
negotiation and didn't feel prepared
regarding equity related questions to
ensure I was getting a great offer with
meaningful upside. Can you talk through
or roleplay how you have done this and
how it should work? Questions to ask,
tips to make sure I can get the best
offer. So, Kelly, this is a pretty meaty
topic here. What's your take? Oh my god,
this is a great one. I I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love
this topic because it is one that so
many of us and honestly especially HR
leaders Nolan they just really don't
understand the nuances and I know you
have stories around this even you
personally and folks are like oh my god
like I wish I would have known this or
been smart about this 10 or eight years
ago when I negotiated this offer and I I
think it's always been this kind of
blackbox box thing in the background,
Nolan, that
not a lot of people know how to work and
it literally could cost you millions of
dollars and upside. And it's really good
to be smart about this. So, this is one
of the thing and I'm I don't know
everything, but this is one of the
things that I get the most joy out of
unveiling the truth for people so they
can be smart about it. Totally. So, like
we're not going to talk about how cash
plays in and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. It's
already complicated enough. How are you
processing the offer? Yes. So, let's
talk through it. My first question is,
so let's just pretend that you offered
me a million options. Okay. My first
question is, that's great, Nolan. Thank
you. What What is the total shares
outstanding?
Right. Meaning the fully diluted share
count. the fully diluted share count
because a million options could be
really great, but it could also not be
really great depending on how many
options they've already given away that
are out in the ether, right? And the
math there, the other way to ask that is
what what percent ownership does that
million shares represent in the company?
So those two things are the same just
because that that confused me for a long
time. It's simply what is the grant
they're offering you? Divide that number
by the number of fully diluted shares,
meaning all the options they've already
given away. That gives you your
ownership in the company. Correct. And
there was a very large Utah company,
Qualrix, that used to only give people
the share, like the number of shares and
would not tell you any other
information. And so you had no idea. And
by the way, I know this because
candidates told me and also my wife got
an offer from Qualrix way way back in
the day. And so if a company doesn't
disclose that information, major red
flag, Kelly, from there, from there,
what are you doing? That's a big deal.
From there, I am asking about the 409A
valuation, which is synonymous with
strike price.
Okay? Because this this is actually a
big deal. And a simple way to say it is
if the 409A valuation is $5, for
example, the strike price is $5 per
share. What that means is you have to
pay out of pocket $5 for every option
you get. So in your example, five $5
times 1 million options in order for you
to own the option. That's correct. So,
people are like, "Oh my gosh, I've had
people, I'm getting a million options at
a $5 strike price. I'm getting $5
million in equity." And it's like,
"Okay, no, no, you are you are only
getting value of equity for anything
above that $5 strike price." So, the
only way you're going to make money in
this company is if the company valuation
grows and the stock is worth more than
$5. So the the other thing to consider
so you should definitely ask about the
 
about the last F fair market value.
That's 4NA, FMV, strike price, all the
same thing. Now you should also ask
about the last preferred price and that
price is what the investors paid. So, if
you think about it like this, investors
just paid a, you know, $150 million
valuation on the company, right? But the
strike price is typically about onethird
of that, right? And that's what you
should be looking for is like anything
like off there. Anything outside of call
it the 20 to 40% band and it changes as
you get later stage. So, if it's later
stage, it will be actually closer to the
preferred price, which is what you're
talking about. But that's that's the
other thing to note which is like how
much do the investors pay at the last
round and then the click in there is
like well who are our investors because
if really smart people are paying high
prices that's typically a good signal.
Yeah. So this is this is a pro tip and
this is something that I've seen that
that differ by company. Some will do it,
some will not. It's really important to
know about it either way. Let's just say
that the company you're, you know,
you're offering me a million shares,
Nolan, at a $5 strike price. Um, the
preferred the preferred value per share,
let's say, is $10 at the last valuation.
So, what that means, everyone, is
they're saying, "We're giving you a
million shares. It was $10 per share
value at the last valuation." And you're
like, "Oh my god, that's great. That's
$10 million. It is not $10 million
because your strike price is $5, right?
So, your value just got cut in half. A
lot of at today's value. At today's
value, right? Because you have to pay
that $5 to then get the $10, which means
$5 net value. So, a lot of people
confuse and their eyes widen when they
hear the last preferred share price was
$10 because they forget that there is a
delta where they have to pay out of
pocket to get that $10. Negotiation
tactic. A lot of people will say that's
wonderful, but I want my offer to be
based on the net value. Like, I don't
want that to be cut in half. So if you
want me to join your company, you need
to offer me the share count today that
is using a $5 value, which is the net
value. Does that make sense? Like a lot
of people don't want to fall for the
trap of forgetting about the out of
pocket. They want to solve for that out
of pocket with the offer, which is
called the net value. And the next thing
to consider here is can you actually
come up with this money?
So, you know, everyone talks about
golden handcuffs and this is actually
exhibit A of when it comes into play and
golden handcuffs aren't actually a thing
if you can exercise your options cuz you
could leave whatever you want. Now, now
maybe there's like significant investing
on the back end and like that that's
another version of it. But the one Kelly
and I are talking about right now is
like in this example over four years
it's going to cost you $5 million if you
vested everything to exercise these
shares. And so if you so say after 12
months, right, you've hit your first
cliff and now you've vested the first
trunch. So it's still going to cost you
$1.25 $25 million to leave with your
options. You can decide to leave without
them, but then you are forfeiting them.
And so depending on how you feel about
the company, this becomes a very big
financial decision for you and your
family. And that's the other thing to
really consider here is like given that
if we're talking about options
because you have to have this cash
outlay, you have to put skin in the game
in addition to your time.
And so I think a lot of people miss
this, right? People don't actually like
think about it tangibly and don't have
conversations with their their partners
or their families or whatnot about what
this actually means. And you should
scenario play. Okay, if I leave in a
year, this is what it's going to cost us
to walk away with these options of which
I am trading my time for. I mean, that's
part of the startup game and that's how
people get wealthy in tech. Yeah. And I
wrote down very important to ask if when
you all are going through this to help
you plan for that financial burden to
get value out of this, you should ask
the company what is your exercise
window? Because
some companies when you leave, right,
you'll have only 90 days to come up with
that money. Exactly. Most companies, by
the way, Kelly, the large majority are
 
are 90 days. And meaning when you leave
that company, you only have three months
to come up with a ton of cash to keep
any options that you worked so hard for,
or else they're gone forever and they're
worth nothing. Some companies have a
longer exercise window. 10 years is the
max. There's a few companies that do
that. Checker did it back in the day.
That's wonderful because that means that
you don't have to plan to be highly
pressured to to to shell out money to
get them quickly. It also can be
negotiable. So, that's something to
think about like, hey, I will join your
company. I want a two-year exercise
window kind of thing. Yeah, the the
negotiation point is really really a
good one. So, a couple things here is
Kelly's exactly right on the negotiation
point. This is really where I went wrong
at Door Dash. I didn't know it was
negotiable. I was like, I just want to
like get out of here and like I want to
go to this next job and like, okay, you
guys can like and they ended up like
buying back my shares at a significant
discount. I wouldn't have done that if I
knew I could negotiate a longer window.
That's a really really good point,
Kelly. A couple of other just nuanced
topics on this which is any unex
exercised options that have a longer
post-termination exercise window than 90
days will convert to NSOs. And so I'm
not going to get into the difference of
ISOs and NSOs. It's really not that big
of a deal depending on where you are.
Sometimes it can be, but you should look
into that and know that that is the
truth. The other piece here is so say
you join this company, right, Kelly? We
were talking about the FMV being a fair
FMV strike price for ana all being five
bucks. Okay. So say after 6 months
you've been there. Now a new investor
comes in or a new fora is issued and now
that price goes up to $7.
So this is really where people get
screwed. So say a million shares vest
after year one and the strike price was
five bucks. So it takes you $5 million
to exercise those. But the IRS is going
to come knock on your door and say
Nolan. But now the FMV strike price is
$7. And so there's a $2 difference
there, right? And so it's actually
because $2 times a million is 2 million.
you gained $2 million and now you owe me
taxes
on that $2 million gain. Now, the way to
avoid this is by early exercising your
options.
And so if you're getting in at the
earliest stage of startups, I call it
say series B and below, I always
recommend if you want to own the equity
that you ask the founder about early
exercising because if you early
exercise, which by the way, if a company
tells you no, that's another red flag.
It's an obvious thing to do. This is a a
very easy lever for founders to pull.
It's literally just a column in the
board deck of saying early exercising on
or off.
But if you early exercise, so say you do
that cash outlay early, right? And then
the FMV appreciates, you don't pay the
taxes until the equity becomes liquid.
And that is a very big difference
because if you're walking away from a
company that's seen strike price
appreciation, you're going to pay to
exercise the options and you're going to
pay on that gain between the FMV now and
where you started. Yes. Hey everyone,
we'll be right back in a moment after a

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talented signal fire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metave is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. MeteView changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metaview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora, and check out
Metave. Head over to metav.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that and Kelly sent
you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
So here's another one that might blow
your mind which I just got when in my
last role.
You can ask to put in your offer letter
that you want the option to be able to
liqufy and sell your options certain
point really
this I mean it has to be approved
obviously and it might not whatever
asking is the first step and the reason
is if you're like look for whatever
reason in your life you need or you want
or like I'm going to need more cash in a
year or two like I have goals or I have
a family like I I just and know we're
going to need more cash
after a year or two years of tenure.
I want commitment that I will be able to
liqufy some of my shares. So, it's kind
of like a mini, you know, secondary for
yourself. Really? Yes. And I'm not
saying it's super common. I'm just
saying that you can ask for that and it
might not be possible if the company
goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and everything's underwater
of course but you have it in there to be
able to do that. Wow. Okay. So, so walk
me through that scenario just a because
I've never heard of that before. Like
the way I would imagine it playing out
is the company and this is definitely
only for executives by the way. So when
when Kelly is talking about negotiation
really what she's saying like this is at
the exact level like anything director
and below if you're trying to negotiate
this stuff they're going to laugh you
out of the room but like so in this case
Kelly I'm assuming what happened was you
said okay the preferred price is 10
bucks if it hits
 
whatever we've seen significant
appreciation
and I hit two years of service time,
then I can sell up to like 10% of my
shares and the company will buy those
shares back. Do I have that right? That
correct? Yeah. Yep, that makes sense.
And and it it does get a little bit
complicated just for the listener of
like who buys the shares back because if
the company's buying them back, they
have to buy them back off the balance
sheet versus if we have, you know, other
investors lined up, right? So, if you're
timing this with a new funding round,
it's less of a big deal. But like in
this case, depending on how the
company's doing and all those sorts of
things, like you can this this clause
can trigger and I can imagine it really
pissing off a CFO if the timing isn't
great. Yeah. And look, I'll be honest,
it didn't happen. We didn't do it. But
that's not the point. The point is that
something you might be able to chat
about. That's interesting. I like that.
The other negotiable piece obviously is
a double trigger. We've talked about
this a lot. Yeah. So, just to explain it
to the audience, right? Which basically
means if the company has a liquidation
event like an IPO or a merger
and they fire me, all of my equity
vests. Yeah. Yes. Or some of it. Half of
it. Yeah. There's there's different
Exactly. There's different mechanisms
within the click. People like So, people
definitely negotiate this as time goes
on. I actually took a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the
episode that you and I talked about this
topic. What I learned from that feedback
is that for later stage companies,
double trigger becomes very common. For
earlier stage companies, it's less
common. But regardless,
if there is an M&amp;A event, your double
trigger will be negotiated as part of
that merger. So it m it's kind of like a
false security like it makes you feel
good that you have it but when the
actual event happens like the the
company who's going to acquire you is
going to sit down with you and say Kelly
like hey we saw this you're good or more
than likely not actually like we're not
signing this deal with the company
unless you take these terms and so
people should know that it's it's a
little bit of false security. Yeah,
sometimes, very rare, sometimes the
vesting schedule can be negotiated. Yep.
I would definitely not count on it. I
don't like doing it for exacts when they
come in. I'm like, everyone else has
this schedule. It's it's really touchy.
But sometimes the vesting schedule can
be negotiated. And I I find that the
best way to negotiate the vesting
schedule is also if you're negotiating
sever like pre-negotiating severance.
And I think the fairest thing that I've
seen for pre-negotiated severance is
like some cash portion in addition to
we'll just remove the cliff of your
equity because that that tends to be
like if I fire you after eight months,
you walk away with no equity. like as an
exec that can be a very very big deal
and execs get fired a lot. That's kind
of the way we leave the building. So
that that's something to think about.
Oh, what a time. So yeah, look, there's
a lot of negotiable aspects here. I just
to to maybe close this, you know, I just
think irrespective of all the bells and
whistles and negotiated things and
please reach out to us if you want to
learn more or you you know want to get
smart about this. I think it's really
important. But the most important thing
is do not take an equity grant on face
value and get excited and get all wound
up over a
sevenf figureure
equity grant because it could not be
what you think. And just make sure you
understand the strike price versus the
preferred share price versus the diluted
count in your ownership. It's really
important. It's such a complicated topic
and you just can't expect the company to
educate you. This is your
responsibility. It is no one else's
responsibility. It's yours. Every one of
these deals is bespoke. This is like
really like leaning on your tribe.
Kelly's feedback is exactly right. So,
ping us, but only ping us if you've
actually done the foundational research.
Do not ping us if you're like showing up
like what does this mean? Like ping
somebody else.
Thanks all. All right. See you. HR
