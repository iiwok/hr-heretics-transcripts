For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, we deep dive into executive
recruiting mastery with VC Andy Price,
covering why exec hires fail, back
channeling strategies, post-hire
support, and building scalable
leadership teams.
&gt;&gt; What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have Andy Price on the show. Andy,
you're a VC and you're also one of the
best exec recruiters in the world.
You've worked with huge winners along
the way, including Snowflake, Confluent,
Mulesoft, and Amplitude, just to name a
few of those. We're stoked for this
conversation. Welcome to the show, man.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So, so honored to be
here. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; I want to start with uh some of my
learnings at Door Dash. I worked really
closely with Tony and he always said the
Michael Jordan of exec recruiting gets
it right two out of three times. Why is
the hit rate for execs so low?
&gt;&gt; By the way, for him it might be
twothirds because he's one of the best
founders in ever. I think that guy is a
superstar and a great human and is
really committed to building an A+ team
and he's thoughtful, very thoughtful
about hiring as you know. So I would say
twothirds in the world of Tony is one
thing. The reality is like most often I
mean I had a partner with one of the
best venture firms in history, one of
the top two probably guess which one it
is say to me we get hiring right
onethird of the time.
So I think that the reason for that is
very simple. It's like if you look at
humans and then you look at companies,
you have complex organisms, right? Every
human is a complex collection of
molecules strung together, right? And
the same thing is true of companies.
Although what you do when you look at
companies is they're far more complex
than any individual human being. So if
you thought about this as a parallel to
like genomics for example, right? And
you're going, okay, can we understand
genomics and then figure out like how to
build drugs that fit this person's
specific genomic profile?
thereby increasing efficacy. Then you
say, "Okay, that's a huge win in
healthcare." So by parallel to making
hiring go to more like three out of
three as opposed to one out of three,
although Tony is again being generous at
two/3, you know, you really would have a
tough time. The reality is is that
there's so many variables that throw off
you could have a great candidate, right,
and a great company and yet those two
just don't make it because of variables
you cannot possibly see. In my mind, the
mitigation factors are really
understanding who you are as an
organization, what you need, and the
standard BS like, "Oh, we're this
culture and this person has to be a
culture fit." Usually, your culture is
wrong or it's immature or it's like
incomplete or it's a collection of
subcultures and it needs to evolve here
and the exec's supposed to take you
there. But the resistance to that, you
know, impact that these people are here
to make, right? There there's no exec
that's hired that's not there to improve
something, right? or change something.
So, by definition, everyone's into
change management without even really
even being able to articulate that. So,
I feel like mitigating these uh blowups
is all about being really pragmatic as
opposed to quote unquote aspirational
about whether or not the person coming
in on your company or the company you're
joining, if you're the candidate, you
know, are going to be this perfect
harmonious situation. You have to strap
in for some vibrations and wildness and
chaos and ambiguity in order to be
pragmatic about, okay, no, they're not
perfect and neither are we. Let's try to
figure out how we mesh together and give
this person a chance to succeed. Does
that make sense? And the fact that the
industry is so immature still around
organization development, HR processes,
onboarding, stuff like that, those are
all factors in why you have what I call
tissue rejection. So I want to know what
you do to try and mitigate that. What is
the artisal process to mitigate a bad
executive outcome?
&gt;&gt; Good question. I think the best way to
mitigate a bad outcome is you actually
have to silk with a company. So when we
designed our search firm, it was always
with the view that if you had more time
to dedicate to an existing company, then
you would actually understand what's
really going on. What happens in most
exec searches, founder will get on a
call because the VC said call recruiter
X, Y, or Z. And there's some really
great ones out there. The great ones
that I know that are competitors to our
search firm, Artisal,
have this exact same thing in common
with Artisal, which is like, okay, let's
just let's do not just one fly by
meeting. Okay, I need this. Okay, great.
We'll go find that person for us. Send
us a contract. We'll go find some people
for you. That's like simplistic way of
going. And it's a reckless approach. The
better thing to do is go, okay, what are
you doing? Tell me everything's wrong
with you. Tell me all your warts, all
your problems, all the things that are
not working. Don't tell me how awesome
your company is. Tell me where it's
going to go wrong. So the more we
understand that, the more a we can say,
"Okay, the candidate's smart. If they're
good, they're smart. They're going to
figure this out on their own. Let's
mitigate the concerns ahead of time so
we can actually close them." This is the
one magic thing you have to nail every
single time. How do you back channel the
hell out of somebody with people you
trust in a contextually accurate way?
meaning don't just back channel and talk
to the person that worked for them 85
years ago like that maybe knew them when
they were 25. You should only use
recruiters that have native familiarity
with the candidate you're hunting.
Meaning they should be specialized. They
should be a go to market person or an
engineering product person or finance
and HR recruiter or CEO recruiter.
Whatever they are, they should be
specialists and natively understand the
people you're chasing. And this is what
you do. You just call them and you say,
"Hey, I'm doing this. Do you have any
ideas?" First of all, see if they offer
up your candidate. That's easy. And then
if they don't offer up your candidate,
you go, "Hey, you know, I'm just kind of
curious." You don't tell them, "I'm
looking for a, you know, president of a
billion-doll privately held company."
You just go, "Hey, I've just heard some
things about this person. I'd love to
get your take." You're very vague about
why. If you have a good relationship
with that person, they'll offer it up,
but you just don't want to reveal who
the client is because you got to assume
these people are like in a high school
locker room and they can't wait to tell
somebody that they got a call about so
and so and about this topic. You need
really like five to seven ones that
count. Even three really count. It's
really about how much color you get as
opposed to volume of people. It's depth
of conversation, depth of context as
opposed to breadth of people. That
number.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have one more on this. In doing
this in my experience as well, Andy, the
thing that I've seen, you guys said 2/3
and one/ird. But I usually say it works
out 50% of the time just cuz my brain is
works simply. And and usually the reason
for it not working out in my experience
isn't the person's technical or
functional skill set or or whatever.
It's the it's the personality fit. It's
the vision fit. It's the dynamics once
you get in there and you really are
living with someone and you figure out
you can't live with this person. And
then I've gotten right. Well, let's get
rid of them. 60 days. Call the search
firm. They didn't do a good job. they're
not fit. Like, how have you handled
that? Because that's something that's
that's where it gets really messy.
&gt;&gt; I mean, look, recruiters are the most
overpaid people in the world. The
reality is is that the recruiters have
to get plant the right person and then
be in constant contact with them. You
should be talking to your candidates
that you hired once a month, once a
quarter, and you're going to detect
what's going on. And the early
vibrations, if you're doing the real
work, actually happens after the hire.
your real work is making sure that that
organism that you just planted in this
other organism doesn't have tissue
rejection or organ rejection whatever
you remember and so I think what you
have to do is detect early issues we
highly recommend you hire an ops person
and mitigate that you have to have trust
with your with your candidate that they
don't freak out because you got you give
them some free advice and it's really
just a heads up so you can mitigate a
lot of blowout risk by doing that and
then also being a person that the
founder or the VCs or both trust enough
that you say look it's the founders's
problem or it's a market product. You
know, we have these early stage
companies all the time. They have no
marketing, no product market fit. You
know, there's not a there there. And so
these sales execs are flopping around
trying to find some traction, some
repeatability. And in those early days,
it's such a risky, chaotic thing that
you really have to make sure that
everybody's heads are screwed on
properly even before you start a search.
A lot of times we look at these
searches, we're like, you don't even
need to do a search. should definitely
not pay any money to hire anybody yet
you are too early. Founders really need
to lead sales for example in C to A.
should never hire a VP of sales before
an a before some meaningful product
market or traction doesn't have BPMF per
se but track repeatable traction and so
people when they either overhire or hire
too early that's where we see a lot of
volatility and mitigating those things
is either not doing a search in the
first place and convincing the cl the
founder to wait until they're ready or
having sanity checks early and often
about what is appropriate at this
particular stage of a company.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talent at Signal Fire,
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metivview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora and check out
MeteView. Head over to
metaviv.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
love the fact that the work starts after
the hire is made. I can't tell you like
how many execs don't have an onboarding
plan. It's just kind of like and you
know I've always been very close to the
exec recruiter and the hire, right? That
that chief people officer of that
company. It's almost like a triad, a
trusting triad between the exec
recruiter, the CPO and the new officer
on like we are here to hug you and make
us successful, good, bad or ugly. And
that doesn't happen a lot. be surprised.
&gt;&gt; I love the idea of the exec recruiter
post hire giving asymmetry to the new
hire. I I love like that as a practice
and I don't think I've ever actually
seen anyone do that. Which brings me to
how should companies vet search firms?
&gt;&gt; That's a tough one, man. Um do you know
the candidate I'm trying to hunt?
Period. How natively do you know this
world? When the search firm comes to the
table, they should be coming in the
first meeting with ideas for the founder
to consider. Period. Like, I did my
homework on the thing. I looked at your
website. I looked at your competitors.
Here's my observations. And here are
some ideas. People should look out for
sloppiness. They should look out for
search firms that have no A+ clientele.
What happens is u a lot of times people
go, "Oh, just call so and so because you
can get a search done more cheaply."
There are search firms out there that'll
give away the service. And you go,
"Okay, well, let's look at their
clientele. It's a bunch of a F-minus
companies. So, if you're a candidate and
you're well placed, which is where all,
like I said, the best people are 90%
currently employed. And that's the bane
of the recruiter's existence. You're
carving people out of situations. They
don't need to take your call. You got to
give them a good reason. A good reason
is having an A+ clientele and really
saying, "This is what we stand for. We
don't take companies that are
turnaround, shrinking, this that." And
there are a handful of recruiters out
there that figured this out a while ago
and they're snotty as hell. I want to
talk to you about upandcomers and I I
think there's this big debate that's
gone on forever, which is do we hire for
experience or do we hire for trajectory.
I want to actually talk about one of
your LinkedIn posts that just absolutely
went off. You describe a situation where
the upandcomer gets the opportunity to
runs the show. They crush it for a few
quarters, but then they miss badly and
they don't know why. The CEO decides to
layer the upandcomer. In most
situations, the upandcomer leaves, but
what you're describing in your post is a
few recent situations where the person
puts their ego aside and decides to stay
for a year or two learning from their
new manager. What are these CEOs doing
that are able to keep these people
around?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's not just the CEOs who are
doing it. It's the person that's
layering the the incumbent. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Oh, interesting.
&gt;&gt; Important thing is for the person. I'll
give you an example of how it was really
really well orchestrated. You guys know
Confluent when Erica Schultz came in
over Todd, you know, Todd had done a
great job. But Erica came in and was
like, "You know what? Just give me a
year. You're going to invest more stock.
We'll figure things out. It'll be a, you
know, they convince those. The founders
and the person who come in both go to
the existing person and say, "Hey, thank
you for the amazing work." As opposed
to, "Here's where you screwed up." Todd
was a total class addict about it.
Stayed there, made sure that his people
were cared for. He was the total adult
about it. And then Erica was smart
because she didn't come in saying, "Oh,
I have to fire a bunch of people and
bring my own people in just what's the
standard operating procedure." So you
have really two three players. The
incumbent has to be an adult and care
about the company they just built. Two,
the person coming in has to be classy,
humble, listen, treat them like a
partner. Three, the founder has to
support this architecture and this
ethos, right? This approach to make sure
it it lands. And you shouldn't be
talking to candidates that are going to
top somebody unless you're saying to
them, how are you going to engage
existing team? So I just believe in
continuity and seamless transitions. It
was about orchestrating kind of the new
person weaving in from the last person
and whether whatever function is whether
it's CEO or head of engineering or head
of sales. These are high-risk situations
and people when people treat these
situations in a cavalier way and then
they wonder why they blew up. It's
because it was treated in a sloppy
cavalere way. I mean like that this is
not rocket science. If I'm a founder and
I have a team of upandcomers, what
should I be doing to help these people
scale?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have to bring in you have to
invest in advisory network and a solid
board. We brought in one of the best
sales exacts in history, guys retired to
be their operating partner and teach
them how to not screw up hiring, go to
market hiring. So you kind of need that
third party to a train up the person, b
give the sanity check to the founder
that hey there are issues that are
beyond this person's control or we can
build underneath them and let's try that
to a certain point build around this
human being. So investing in your
existing execs and knowing that they
can't do everything themselves. When you
hire a VP of sales, you can't expect
them to be world class at sales ops,
orchestration, productivity, coverage,
comp, the P&amp;L, attainment. You can't
expect them to do all that and then hit
a revenue uh growth number that's always
ridiculous. What do I do to equip this
person so that they can actually shoot
laser beams out of their eyes and fly?
They don't just come into your company
with an S on their chest and a red cape.
You've got to help them, right? That is
the best articulation for adviserss and
coaches that I've ever heard. All right,
last topic I want to hit is executive
career management. And so my take is is
like careers are a game. And I find that
the best execs play that game insanely
well. What are the common patterns of
how the best execs manage their careers?
&gt;&gt; Best execs are somewhat selectively
listening. They're never out looking
because why? Because they chose a good
company in the first place and one of
the questions is is that good company
starting to flame out or getting
acquired or taken private or whatever.
What's their motivation for, you know,
moving on? Or they're going to say, hey,
I have this uh person I brought into
cultivated. I'm now it's time for me to
go off and do another one because I'm
kind of bored and this is a little
programmatic for me and I want to grow
something again. So when you think about
the motivations of people that's one
thing but in terms of them you know
managing their own careers the smart
ones watch the industry in their spare
time. They don't do it during their work
hours. They're heads down operating but
then they take their spare time and
they're like interesting. This
generative AI thing might turn into
something. Maybe I should watch Open the
Eye Inan Tropic or I should watch this
company or that company or should I
think about workflow or should I think
about the tuning companies or should I
think about Sarah doing this
ridiculously
screaming fast chip that they built. How
should I look at this space because I
think I want to participate in it. So
they start studying the category and
building a little thesis in their own
minds about companies they'd be open to.
And then they hang around the right
people. There are three or four go to
market recruiters that are get all the
A+ late stage things and there are a
bunch of them that do the middle stage
stuff. bunch of them do early stage
knowing who to listen to and build trust
with it and then telling those people
don't ever call me about companies like
this I will it'll harm our relationship
they actually work with recruiters in a
pretty bespoke way where they say if you
show me things like this I'm more
actively listening if you show me things
like that I literally don't return your
call and the smart recruiters give them
only the things they ask for and then
you have some ball control on that
person but in terms of people managing
their careers they're always kind of
looking okay bases. Should I be in this
category? Is DevOps going to be more
interesting space than generative AI? Is
big data kind of getting
overwhelmed by you know AI which is
another way of thinking about big data.
You know in other words they're looking
at the categories in which they're
currently operating or want to operate
in. If you're at uh Veronus for example
and you're doing data security posture
management you might be like hm sire and
these other guys are kind of coming up
the curve really fast and so what do I
do about that? Maybe is my founder on
top of this or is my CEO on top of this?
Do we have a game plan to save off the
the horde or have I is this the end? You
know, would people at New Relic uh
towards the end were like, "God, Data
Dog is going to take us, you know, take
over the world." The smart ones saw that
and the companies somewhat reacted. They
did some good things. They had a nice
outcome, but at the end of the day,
people knew Data Dog was just going to
win. You could see it. And so I think
that the smart people are really aware
of their own situation and the futility
sometimes that of the situation that
they're in early and often and either
they do something to fix or they okay
I'm on the wrong horse and then I'm
going to move to this horse. But they
have a point of view on the kinds of
things they're open to and why.
&gt;&gt; My last question Andy is about exact
tenure. You know, back in the day when I
was young, it was three to five years.
It was this and then I've heard it's all
the way to to one year is acceptable and
everything in between. And there's just
a lot of noise out there on tenure and
whatnot. I just love your thoughts on
that.
&gt;&gt; I hate the one year BS. It's like you
can have one or two of those in your
career. You have three or four. Just it
tells you everything about somebody. And
then somebody was like, "Oh, it has to
do with the psycho founders." Like, no,
it does not. If you are smart and you
are judicious, you know how to vet a
human being. Otherwise, why why does
anybody give you the right to hire
anybody if you're not a judge of
character, you shouldn't have the right
to be a manager or a VP or a seale,
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Totally.
&gt;&gt; So, you should be able to look into the
eyes of the founder, ask them questions,
test them. One other thing I'll quickly
say is people don't ask each other hard
questions early on enough and gauge how
the other person can handle a hard
question. That's really important. And
so I think tenure has to do with people
being flaky and being like, "Oh, okay.
Well, I'm going to go make this money
there or make this money there." And
they're like little squirrels running
around the forest blindly trying to grab
the acorns, stuff them in the tree for
the harsh winter, and they're scrambling
around, but there's no game plan there,
right? Like they're not the alpha of the
forest for a reason. They're lower on
the food chain. So when you think about
the people that really kick ass, you
look at their career trajectories, they
may go through four or five major runs,
three, four, five, six years a piece. 20
years too long. Five years, yay. One
year, you like I said, things go crazy.
A company get acquired. They can run out
of money. There's all this volatility in
the industry. 100%. Give people some
passes for these couple of these things
here and there. But if you have a
succession of one year things, it's like
I don't want to see your bio have some
better judgment in. Come back to me. I
always tell people when they hit me on
LinkedIn, I'm like, I'm sorry, but your
bio is like a dog's breakfast. You've
done nothing. You need to go do
something with someone else. Then come
back to us in three years when you've
gone and killed it somewhere and proven
you can stay somewhere and make a
contribution. In a year you can barely
find your way to the office in the first
year. I mean come on.
&gt;&gt; Totally. Well, I was expecting a strong
strong response here and I got it. So
thank you. We didn't even
&gt;&gt; I'm serious. Like the people we all
aspire to and we all earn but we all
admire most people I know in the
industry do admire people with grit,
determination that did hard things very
well. And you can only do hard things
very well over an arc of time. It's not
a one year. You can't do any meaningful
impact in a year. I just really believe
that. I don't really care if people
agree with me or not. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Resilience is definitely coming back in
style. And I think that's actually been
one of the one of the nice things from
this macro environment is like those
people that are persisting are going to
have great stories to tell just like
you.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. People like millennials and
these Gen Zers, man, people always hate
on these kids. One of the things they
will say is that they really value
authenticity. Authenticity is like the
number one buzz word for them. It's
getting old for some people. I'm like,
I'm not getting old to me at all.
Authenticity is like if that's your core
belief that authenticity is like number
one factor, then you have more, you
know, more real conversations with
people and you you can actually work
your way through things. You're not
pretending. There's no BS in sight. if
you have that true north. So I actually
think that the industry has been driven
that way largely by the by the obsession
with authenticity from the millennials
which they pass down to these Gen Zers.
The best Gen Z people think about that
first and they know they have to live it
too.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Andy, you're a legend. Thank you so
much for the time today.
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much Andy.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Thanks so much for having me.
Appreciate it.
