best exec recruiters in the world.
 
best exec recruiters in the world.

Mulesoft, and Amplitude, just to name a
few of those. We're stoked for this

conversation. Welcome to the show, man.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So, so honored to be
 
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So, so honored to be
here. Thank you.
 
here. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; I want to start with uh some of my
 
&gt;&gt; I want to start with uh some of my
learnings at Door Dash. I worked really
 
learnings at Door Dash. I worked really
closely with Tony and he always said the
 
closely with Tony and he always said the
Michael Jordan of exec recruiting gets
 
Michael Jordan of exec recruiting gets
it right two out of three times. Why is
 
it right two out of three times. Why is
the hit rate for execs so low?
 
the hit rate for execs so low?
&gt;&gt; By the way, for him it might be
 
&gt;&gt; By the way, for him it might be
twothirds because he's one of the best
 
twothirds because he's one of the best
founders in ever. I think that guy is a
 
founders in ever. I think that guy is a
superstar and a great human and is
 
superstar and a great human and is
really committed to building an A+ team
 
really committed to building an A+ team
and he's thoughtful, very thoughtful
 
and he's thoughtful, very thoughtful
about hiring as you know. So I would say
 
about hiring as you know. So I would say
twothirds in the world of Tony is one
 
twothirds in the world of Tony is one
thing. The reality is like most often I
 
thing. The reality is like most often I
mean I had a partner with one of the
 
mean I had a partner with one of the
best venture firms in history, one of
 
best venture firms in history, one of
the top two probably guess which one it
 
the top two probably guess which one it
is say to me we get hiring right
 
is say to me we get hiring right
onethird of the time.
 
onethird of the time.
So I think that the reason for that is
 
So I think that the reason for that is
very simple. It's like if you look at
 
very simple. It's like if you look at
humans and then you look at companies,
 
humans and then you look at companies,
you have complex organisms, right? Every
 
you have complex organisms, right? Every
human is a complex collection of
 
human is a complex collection of
molecules strung together, right? And
 
molecules strung together, right? And
the same thing is true of companies.
 
the same thing is true of companies.
Although what you do when you look at
 
Although what you do when you look at
companies is they're far more complex
 
companies is they're far more complex
than any individual human being. So if
 
than any individual human being. So if
you thought about this as a parallel to
 
you thought about this as a parallel to
like genomics for example, right? And
 
like genomics for example, right? And
you're going, okay, can we understand
 
you're going, okay, can we understand
genomics and then figure out like how to
 
genomics and then figure out like how to
build drugs that fit this person's
 
build drugs that fit this person's
specific genomic profile?
 
specific genomic profile?
thereby increasing efficacy. Then you
 
thereby increasing efficacy. Then you
say, "Okay, that's a huge win in
 
say, "Okay, that's a huge win in
healthcare." So by parallel to making
 
healthcare." So by parallel to making
hiring go to more like three out of
 
hiring go to more like three out of
three as opposed to one out of three,
 
three as opposed to one out of three,
although Tony is again being generous at
 
although Tony is again being generous at
two/3, you know, you really would have a
 
two/3, you know, you really would have a
tough time. The reality is is that
 
tough time. The reality is is that
there's so many variables that throw off
 
there's so many variables that throw off
you could have a great candidate, right,
 
you could have a great candidate, right,
and a great company and yet those two
 
and a great company and yet those two
just don't make it because of variables
 
just don't make it because of variables
you cannot possibly see. In my mind, the
 
you cannot possibly see. In my mind, the
mitigation factors are really
 
mitigation factors are really
understanding who you are as an
 
understanding who you are as an
organization, what you need, and the
 
organization, what you need, and the
standard BS like, "Oh, we're this
 
standard BS like, "Oh, we're this
culture and this person has to be a
 
culture and this person has to be a
culture fit." Usually, your culture is
 
culture fit." Usually, your culture is
wrong or it's immature or it's like
 
wrong or it's immature or it's like
incomplete or it's a collection of
 
incomplete or it's a collection of
subcultures and it needs to evolve here
 
subcultures and it needs to evolve here
and the exec's supposed to take you
 
and the exec's supposed to take you
there. But the resistance to that, you
 
there. But the resistance to that, you
know, impact that these people are here
 
know, impact that these people are here
to make, right? There there's no exec
 
to make, right? There there's no exec
that's hired that's not there to improve
 
that's hired that's not there to improve
something, right? or change something.
 
something, right? or change something.
So, by definition, everyone's into
 
So, by definition, everyone's into
change management without even really
 
change management without even really
even being able to articulate that. So,
 
even being able to articulate that. So,
I feel like mitigating these uh blowups
 
I feel like mitigating these uh blowups
is all about being really pragmatic as
 
is all about being really pragmatic as
opposed to quote unquote aspirational
 
opposed to quote unquote aspirational
about whether or not the person coming
 
about whether or not the person coming
in on your company or the company you're
 
in on your company or the company you're
joining, if you're the candidate, you
 
joining, if you're the candidate, you
know, are going to be this perfect
 
know, are going to be this perfect
harmonious situation. You have to strap
 
harmonious situation. You have to strap
in for some vibrations and wildness and
 
in for some vibrations and wildness and
chaos and ambiguity in order to be
 
chaos and ambiguity in order to be
pragmatic about, okay, no, they're not
 
pragmatic about, okay, no, they're not
perfect and neither are we. Let's try to
 
perfect and neither are we. Let's try to
figure out how we mesh together and give
 
figure out how we mesh together and give
this person a chance to succeed. Does
 
this person a chance to succeed. Does
that make sense? And the fact that the
 
that make sense? And the fact that the
industry is so immature still around
 
industry is so immature still around
organization development, HR processes,
 
organization development, HR processes,
onboarding, stuff like that, those are
 
onboarding, stuff like that, those are
all factors in why you have what I call
 
all factors in why you have what I call
tissue rejection. So I want to know what
 
tissue rejection. So I want to know what
you do to try and mitigate that. What is
 
you do to try and mitigate that. What is
the artisal process to mitigate a bad
 
the artisal process to mitigate a bad
executive outcome?
 
executive outcome?
&gt;&gt; Good question. I think the best way to
 
&gt;&gt; Good question. I think the best way to
mitigate a bad outcome is you actually
 
mitigate a bad outcome is you actually
have to silk with a company. So when we
 
have to silk with a company. So when we
designed our search firm, it was always
 
designed our search firm, it was always
with the view that if you had more time
 
with the view that if you had more time
to dedicate to an existing company, then
 
to dedicate to an existing company, then
you would actually understand what's
 
you would actually understand what's
really going on. What happens in most
 
really going on. What happens in most
exec searches, founder will get on a
 
exec searches, founder will get on a
call because the VC said call recruiter
 
call because the VC said call recruiter
X, Y, or Z. And there's some really
 
X, Y, or Z. And there's some really
great ones out there. The great ones
 
great ones out there. The great ones
that I know that are competitors to our
 
that I know that are competitors to our
search firm, Artisal,
 
search firm, Artisal,
have this exact same thing in common
 
have this exact same thing in common
with Artisal, which is like, okay, let's
 
with Artisal, which is like, okay, let's
just let's do not just one fly by
 
just let's do not just one fly by
meeting. Okay, I need this. Okay, great.
 
meeting. Okay, I need this. Okay, great.
We'll go find that person for us. Send
 
We'll go find that person for us. Send
us a contract. We'll go find some people
 
us a contract. We'll go find some people
for you. That's like simplistic way of
 
for you. That's like simplistic way of
going. And it's a reckless approach. The
 
going. And it's a reckless approach. The
better thing to do is go, okay, what are
 
better thing to do is go, okay, what are
you doing? Tell me everything's wrong
 
you doing? Tell me everything's wrong
with you. Tell me all your warts, all
 
with you. Tell me all your warts, all
your problems, all the things that are
 
your problems, all the things that are
not working. Don't tell me how awesome
 
not working. Don't tell me how awesome
your company is. Tell me where it's
 
your company is. Tell me where it's
going to go wrong. So the more we
 
going to go wrong. So the more we
understand that, the more a we can say,
 
understand that, the more a we can say,
"Okay, the candidate's smart. If they're
 
"Okay, the candidate's smart. If they're
good, they're smart. They're going to
 
good, they're smart. They're going to
figure this out on their own. Let's
 
figure this out on their own. Let's
mitigate the concerns ahead of time so
 
mitigate the concerns ahead of time so
we can actually close them." This is the
 
we can actually close them." This is the
one magic thing you have to nail every
 
one magic thing you have to nail every
single time. How do you back channel the
 
single time. How do you back channel the
hell out of somebody with people you
 
hell out of somebody with people you
trust in a contextually accurate way?
 
trust in a contextually accurate way?
meaning don't just back channel and talk
 
meaning don't just back channel and talk
to the person that worked for them 85
 
to the person that worked for them 85
years ago like that maybe knew them when
 
years ago like that maybe knew them when
they were 25. You should only use
 
they were 25. You should only use
recruiters that have native familiarity
 
recruiters that have native familiarity
with the candidate you're hunting.
 
with the candidate you're hunting.
Meaning they should be specialized. They
 
Meaning they should be specialized. They
should be a go to market person or an
 
should be a go to market person or an
engineering product person or finance
 
engineering product person or finance
and HR recruiter or CEO recruiter.
 
and HR recruiter or CEO recruiter.
Whatever they are, they should be
 
Whatever they are, they should be
specialists and natively understand the
 
specialists and natively understand the
people you're chasing. And this is what
 
people you're chasing. And this is what
you do. You just call them and you say,
 
you do. You just call them and you say,
"Hey, I'm doing this. Do you have any
 
"Hey, I'm doing this. Do you have any
ideas?" First of all, see if they offer
 
ideas?" First of all, see if they offer
up your candidate. That's easy. And then
 
up your candidate. That's easy. And then
if they don't offer up your candidate,
 
if they don't offer up your candidate,
you go, "Hey, you know, I'm just kind of
 
you go, "Hey, you know, I'm just kind of
curious." You don't tell them, "I'm
 
curious." You don't tell them, "I'm
looking for a, you know, president of a
 
looking for a, you know, president of a
billion-doll privately held company."
 
billion-doll privately held company."
You just go, "Hey, I've just heard some
 
You just go, "Hey, I've just heard some
things about this person. I'd love to
 
things about this person. I'd love to
get your take." You're very vague about
 
get your take." You're very vague about
why. If you have a good relationship
 
why. If you have a good relationship
with that person, they'll offer it up,
 
with that person, they'll offer it up,
but you just don't want to reveal who
 
but you just don't want to reveal who
the client is because you got to assume
 
the client is because you got to assume
these people are like in a high school
 
these people are like in a high school
locker room and they can't wait to tell
 
locker room and they can't wait to tell
somebody that they got a call about so
 
somebody that they got a call about so
and so and about this topic. You need
 
and so and about this topic. You need
really like five to seven ones that
 
really like five to seven ones that
count. Even three really count. It's
 
count. Even three really count. It's
really about how much color you get as
 
really about how much color you get as
opposed to volume of people. It's depth
 
opposed to volume of people. It's depth
of conversation, depth of context as
 
of conversation, depth of context as
opposed to breadth of people. That
 
opposed to breadth of people. That
number.
 
number.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have one more on this. In doing
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have one more on this. In doing
this in my experience as well, Andy, the
 
this in my experience as well, Andy, the
thing that I've seen, you guys said 2/3
 
thing that I've seen, you guys said 2/3
and one/ird. But I usually say it works
 
and one/ird. But I usually say it works
out 50% of the time just cuz my brain is
 
out 50% of the time just cuz my brain is
works simply. And and usually the reason
 
works simply. And and usually the reason
for it not working out in my experience
 
for it not working out in my experience
isn't the person's technical or
 
isn't the person's technical or
functional skill set or or whatever.
 
functional skill set or or whatever.
It's the it's the personality fit. It's
 
It's the it's the personality fit. It's
the vision fit. It's the dynamics once
 
the vision fit. It's the dynamics once
you get in there and you really are
 
you get in there and you really are
living with someone and you figure out
 
living with someone and you figure out
you can't live with this person. And
 
you can't live with this person. And
then I've gotten right. Well, let's get
 
then I've gotten right. Well, let's get
rid of them. 60 days. Call the search
 
rid of them. 60 days. Call the search
firm. They didn't do a good job. they're
 
firm. They didn't do a good job. they're
not fit. Like, how have you handled
 
not fit. Like, how have you handled
that? Because that's something that's
 
that? Because that's something that's
that's where it gets really messy.
 
that's where it gets really messy.
&gt;&gt; I mean, look, recruiters are the most
 
&gt;&gt; I mean, look, recruiters are the most
overpaid people in the world. The
 
overpaid people in the world. The
reality is is that the recruiters have
 
reality is is that the recruiters have
to get plant the right person and then
 
to get plant the right person and then
be in constant contact with them. You
 
be in constant contact with them. You
should be talking to your candidates
 
should be talking to your candidates
that you hired once a month, once a
 
that you hired once a month, once a
quarter, and you're going to detect
 
quarter, and you're going to detect
what's going on. And the early
 
what's going on. And the early
vibrations, if you're doing the real
 
vibrations, if you're doing the real
work, actually happens after the hire.
 
work, actually happens after the hire.
your real work is making sure that that
 
your real work is making sure that that
organism that you just planted in this
 
organism that you just planted in this
other organism doesn't have tissue
 
other organism doesn't have tissue
rejection or organ rejection whatever
 
rejection or organ rejection whatever
you remember and so I think what you
 
you remember and so I think what you
have to do is detect early issues we
 
have to do is detect early issues we
highly recommend you hire an ops person
 
highly recommend you hire an ops person
and mitigate that you have to have trust
 
and mitigate that you have to have trust
with your with your candidate that they
 
with your with your candidate that they
don't freak out because you got you give
 
don't freak out because you got you give
them some free advice and it's really
 
them some free advice and it's really
just a heads up so you can mitigate a
 
just a heads up so you can mitigate a
lot of blowout risk by doing that and
 
lot of blowout risk by doing that and
then also being a person that the
 
then also being a person that the
founder or the VCs or both trust enough
 
founder or the VCs or both trust enough
that you say look it's the founders's
 
that you say look it's the founders's
problem or it's a market product. You
 
problem or it's a market product. You
know, we have these early stage
 
know, we have these early stage
companies all the time. They have no
 
companies all the time. They have no
marketing, no product market fit. You
 
marketing, no product market fit. You
know, there's not a there there. And so
 
know, there's not a there there. And so
these sales execs are flopping around
 
these sales execs are flopping around
trying to find some traction, some
 
trying to find some traction, some
repeatability. And in those early days,
 
repeatability. And in those early days,
it's such a risky, chaotic thing that
 
it's such a risky, chaotic thing that
you really have to make sure that
 
you really have to make sure that
everybody's heads are screwed on
 
everybody's heads are screwed on
properly even before you start a search.
 
properly even before you start a search.
A lot of times we look at these
 
A lot of times we look at these
searches, we're like, you don't even
 
searches, we're like, you don't even
need to do a search. should definitely
 
need to do a search. should definitely
not pay any money to hire anybody yet
 
not pay any money to hire anybody yet
you are too early. Founders really need
 
you are too early. Founders really need
to lead sales for example in C to A.
 
to lead sales for example in C to A.
should never hire a VP of sales before
 
should never hire a VP of sales before
an a before some meaningful product
 
an a before some meaningful product
market or traction doesn't have BPMF per
 
market or traction doesn't have BPMF per
se but track repeatable traction and so
 
se but track repeatable traction and so
people when they either overhire or hire
 
people when they either overhire or hire
too early that's where we see a lot of
 
too early that's where we see a lot of
volatility and mitigating those things
 
volatility and mitigating those things
is either not doing a search in the
 
is either not doing a search in the
first place and convincing the cl the
 
first place and convincing the cl the
founder to wait until they're ready or
 
founder to wait until they're ready or
having sanity checks early and often
 
having sanity checks early and often
about what is appropriate at this
 
about what is appropriate at this
particular stage of a company.
 
particular stage of a company.

Confluent when Erica Schultz came in
over Todd, you know, Todd had done a
 
over Todd, you know, Todd had done a
great job. But Erica came in and was

We'll figure things out. It'll be a, you

and the person who come in both go to
 
and the person who come in both go to
the existing person and say, "Hey, thank
 
the existing person and say, "Hey, thank
you for the amazing work." As opposed
 
you for the amazing work." As opposed

Stayed there, made sure that his people
 
Stayed there, made sure that his people
were cared for. He was the total adult
 
were cared for. He was the total adult
about it. And then Erica was smart
 
about it. And then Erica was smart
because she didn't come in saying, "Oh,

I have to fire a bunch of people and
 
I have to fire a bunch of people and
bring my own people in just what's the

have really two three players. The
 
have really two three players. The

about the company they just built. Two,
 
about the company they just built. Two,
the person coming in has to be classy,
 
the person coming in has to be classy,
humble, listen, treat them like a

it's CEO or head of engineering or head
 
it's CEO or head of engineering or head
of sales. These are high-risk situations
 
of sales. These are high-risk situations
and people when people treat these
 
and people when people treat these
situations in a cavalier way and then
 
situations in a cavalier way and then
they wonder why they blew up. It's
 
they wonder why they blew up. It's
because it was treated in a sloppy
 
because it was treated in a sloppy
cavalere way. I mean like that this is
 
cavalere way. I mean like that this is
not rocket science. If I'm a founder and
 
not rocket science. If I'm a founder and
I have a team of upandcomers, what
 
I have a team of upandcomers, what
should I be doing to help these people
 
should I be doing to help these people

be their operating partner and teach
 
be their operating partner and teach
them how to not screw up hiring, go to

build underneath them and let's try that
to a certain point build around this
 
to a certain point build around this
human being. So investing in your
 
human being. So investing in your
existing execs and knowing that they
 
existing execs and knowing that they
can't do everything themselves. When you
 
can't do everything themselves. When you

last topic I want to hit is executive
 
last topic I want to hit is executive
career management. And so my take is is
 
career management. And so my take is is
like careers are a game. And I find that
 
like careers are a game. And I find that
the best execs play that game insanely
 
the best execs play that game insanely
well. What are the common patterns of
 
well. What are the common patterns of
how the best execs manage their careers?
 
how the best execs manage their careers?
&gt;&gt; Best execs are somewhat selectively
 
&gt;&gt; Best execs are somewhat selectively
listening. They're never out looking

What's their motivation for, you know,
 
What's their motivation for, you know,

go off and do another one because I'm
kind of bored and this is a little
 
kind of bored and this is a little
programmatic for me and I want to grow

they start studying the category and

you have some ball control on that
 
you have some ball control on that
person but in terms of people managing
 
person but in terms of people managing
their careers they're always kind of
 
their careers they're always kind of
looking okay bases. Should I be in this
 
looking okay bases. Should I be in this

towards the end were like, "God, Data

and the companies somewhat reacted. They
 
and the companies somewhat reacted. They
did some good things. They had a nice
 
did some good things. They had a nice
outcome, but at the end of the day,
 
outcome, but at the end of the day,
people knew Data Dog was just going to
 
people knew Data Dog was just going to
win. You could see it. And so I think
 
win. You could see it. And so I think
that the smart people are really aware
 
that the smart people are really aware
of their own situation and the futility
 
of their own situation and the futility
sometimes that of the situation that
 
sometimes that of the situation that
they're in early and often and either
 
they're in early and often and either
they do something to fix or they okay
 
they do something to fix or they okay
I'm on the wrong horse and then I'm
 
I'm on the wrong horse and then I'm
going to move to this horse. But they

&gt;&gt; My last question Andy is about exact
 
&gt;&gt; My last question Andy is about exact
tenure. You know, back in the day when I
 
tenure. You know, back in the day when I
was young, it was three to five years.
 
was young, it was three to five years.
It was this and then I've heard it's all
 
It was this and then I've heard it's all
the way to to one year is acceptable and
 
the way to to one year is acceptable and
everything in between. And there's just
 
everything in between. And there's just
a lot of noise out there on tenure and
 
a lot of noise out there on tenure and
whatnot. I just love your thoughts on
 
whatnot. I just love your thoughts on
that.
 
that.
&gt;&gt; I hate the one year BS. It's like you
 
&gt;&gt; I hate the one year BS. It's like you
can have one or two of those in your
 
can have one or two of those in your
career. You have three or four. Just it
 
career. You have three or four. Just it
tells you everything about somebody. And
 
tells you everything about somebody. And
then somebody was like, "Oh, it has to
 
then somebody was like, "Oh, it has to
do with the psycho founders." Like, no,
 
do with the psycho founders." Like, no,
it does not. If you are smart and you
 
it does not. If you are smart and you
are judicious, you know how to vet a
 
are judicious, you know how to vet a
human being. Otherwise, why why does
 
human being. Otherwise, why why does
anybody give you the right to hire
 
anybody give you the right to hire
anybody if you're not a judge of
 
anybody if you're not a judge of
character, you shouldn't have the right
 
character, you shouldn't have the right
to be a manager or a VP or a seale,
 
to be a manager or a VP or a seale,
whatever.
 
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Totally.
 
&gt;&gt; Totally.
&gt;&gt; So, you should be able to look into the
 
&gt;&gt; So, you should be able to look into the
eyes of the founder, ask them questions,
 
eyes of the founder, ask them questions,
test them. One other thing I'll quickly
 
test them. One other thing I'll quickly
say is people don't ask each other hard
 
say is people don't ask each other hard
questions early on enough and gauge how
 
questions early on enough and gauge how
the other person can handle a hard
 
the other person can handle a hard
question. That's really important. And
 
question. That's really important. And
so I think tenure has to do with people
 
so I think tenure has to do with people
being flaky and being like, "Oh, okay.
 
being flaky and being like, "Oh, okay.
Well, I'm going to go make this money

the food chain. So when you think about
the people that really kick ass, you
 
the people that really kick ass, you

look at their career trajectories, they
may go through four or five major runs,
