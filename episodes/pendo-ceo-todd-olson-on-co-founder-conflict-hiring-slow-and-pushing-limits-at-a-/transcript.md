hey everyone welcome back to HR Heretics
I've been looking forward to this
episode for months we have Todd Olsson
here with us CEO and founder of pendo
which he started back in January of 2014
so it's been about 10 years plus or
minus Todd and I have known each other
probably for about four and a half years
now um when I came in as the chief
people officer and we worked very
closely and still do uh I wore pink
today for this and Todd knows I rarely
wear bright pink sweaters bright pink
shoes a lot but not bright pink sweaters
so I'm all in and pendo and prior to
pendo Todd was head of products for
rally software for about four years has
been a chief scientist board member CTO
and grew up as a developer
so we are we are really stoked about
this chat and he's probably one of the
most personable passionate and
charismatic leaders I've ever worked
with so this will be a good one so Todd
I'd love to hear I'd love to hear just
your journey I mean you you have been a
developer a scientist a technical
product Guru you wrote a book on it that
has been you know well sold did you ever
think you'd become a CEO did that ever
play into your mind or did it start with
the thing yeah look I mean yes and no I
think is the easy answer I mean just
being honest I don't know it's not a
very humble thing to say I guess but you
know when I was young yeah I I probably
saw myself in leadership and you know I
started working in a bank at age 14 and
I literally would bring a suit in a
duffel bag and I would change when I got
off a bus that let me off uh next to
this Bank MBNA which is now part of Bank
of America I put a full suit on the
bathroom and I go to work you know every
single day and I got a decent amount of
prominence you know where I would
interact with senior vice presidents at
banks at age 14 15 16 and I kind of got
addicted to business very very early and
I wouldn't lie if I didn't say it back
then I really I wanted to run the bank
one day or I thought I wanted to run the
bank one day now I I didn't know what it
meant to be a regulated industry and I
you know was certainly insulated by a
lot of it but um I felt it very very
early on um you know then I went to
college and started my first company
with one of the co-founders of of pendo
Eric bodic and and then it was
interesting no one took the CEO title
Eric called himself president I was
CTO uh and interesting we divided and
conquered the the business in some ways
you know I had obviously all things
technical but I also owned HR
interestingly as one of my first jobs as
an entrepreneur I actually I mean I
remember like going through tax tables
and writing like writing checks this is
pre peos and things like that so so yeah
I was always kind of passionate about
like people in the HR fun function and
part of the theory was most of our
employees were engineers and I ran
engineering so he might as well just
have me run HR as well so I was like it
seems like it all fits together so we
did that for a while and um you know I I
I think eventually you get kind of typ
cast in Tech as the CTO as the technical
person you know get with a group of
folks it's like well I guess you're the
CTO type you might as well just be the
CTO at this next thing so I definitely
got into a phase in my career where I
was like yeah you know we should hire a
CEO that's business e things maybe an
NBA NBA you know maybe a A salesperson I
always I I will say I probably felt a
little scared of sales earlier in my
career and that second startup so I
started a second company after my first
I was my idea I conceived of it I was
going to raise capital I was like let me
go go out and get a co-founder who can
be the CEO and run this thing and I'll
be honest probably one of the worst
decisions of my career I um I didn't
realize how much I seeded to him once by
bringing him in all of a sudden the
investors only want to talk to him like
things like core values what I I I felt
passionate about creating they're like
no we don't need those and it kind of
went from being what what I thought was
gonna be my company to like not my
company very very
quickly long story short that did not
end well like he and I you know we there
was definitely kind of a falling out at
some point he ended up departing I ended
up being the CEO with six months of cash
left in 2008 which as we all know 200 it
was not a great time to raise Capital so
I did get a soft Landing from it but
that was the time when I realized that
whatever I did next whatever I did next
I had to be the CEO and only because it
was a huge regret I realized that I had
given it up because I was fearful and
really didn't understand what the job
was and that's the other thing there is
no job description there is no this is
what you do every day when you come to
work so in that sense if you don't
really know what it is it's kind of hard
to say I want to do it and I think I
every time I've tried to be somewhat
humble in my life it's probably
backfired just own it man like if you
want to go do it go do it and I I think
that's kind of how we started pendo I
was very direct and honest with my
co-founders like you know we're gonna do
this and this is this is what I like to
do and this is what like my role to be
and and whether I'm a builder or not I'm
still gonna have this role so that's
kind of how we got in here yeah and you
mentioned co-founders so I don't think
I've ever asked a CEO founder this since
we started the show and I'd love your
take on it Todd because
I've worked in all my Venture companies
it hasn't been one founder CEO it's been
three or four every company and usually
that you know it's a little turbulent
and doesn't always end with duckies and
hores like I've been in the middle of it
and I've also been at companies like
penda where it works really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well
and you four I know Eric's not there
anymore but you four have been together
for years and three of you still are and
that's a very close working relationship
and I think think that's more Uncommon
than common and I love just to hear how
that works I obviously knew Eric Boda
because we started a company together
we're also best friends so we have
personal lives that are that are very
much intertwined and we hadn't worked
together for years prior to pendo and
we'd always said if the timing aligned
we would want to do it
again so we did Rahul jeane was a VC at
that company that I sold in 2008 so I
got kind of close to him that process
and kind of was calling him and he was
interested and I thought he'd just be a
good person to have on the team someone
that can handle just a lot of things and
I I was I joke and I would tell him to
his face we kind of call him the Jack of
all trades founder you know because he
had Finance he's had customer success
now he's in product you know he and he's
honestly a team player he'll just kind
of take on everything and by the way
really useful things to have in a
startup Swiss army knife super useful
and then Eric trone I I do think Eric
and I knew of each other we had never
worked together and I do think he was
one of the key hires because going back
to my first thing he helped me not be
typ cast into being the CTO because
originally when the three of us were
doing it without Eric trone it was
assumed that I was going to be like both
CEO and CTO sort of thing and I knew
that would ultimately limit the company
and by hiring a CTO who was world class
that can just kind of take that off my
plate it was really really powerful for
the business now we had an adjustment
period look there are periods where um
one of our original Engineers like we
were in this like tiny co-working space
like not much bigger than this room and
we're like stacked back to back and we
would get into it like I'm used to being
a CTO and he's used to be like and we
were just sparring at how you build
things and why we're doing this one time
like Scott parkerson whatever Orin
Engineers turned around it's like hey
Mom and Dad can you just stop arguing in
front of us like we just can't take it
any
longer but look conflict is part of any
relationship ship and how you deal with
that conflict and how you like like in
some relationships break because they
they like sweep conflict under the rug
and pretend it doesn't exist and and
I've being a big believer of let's
address conflict head on the good news
we have a lot of mutual respect for each
other so while we may have not always
agreed on how to get to the answer when
we have stepped back grabbed you know
lunch or coffee we've always found a way
through these things and I think it's
just about both coming to the
conversation wanting it to be successful
and working out because we do have a
mutual respect for each other you know
to this day you know Eric you know the
the Eric T is the most interesting one
you know and then actually I say this
one of the VCS early on didn't think we
to work together seed VCS and didn't
invest solely for that reason now ends
up being one of the worst decisions
financially that person probably
 
made uh but but yeah like when you have
two Founders that never work together
and they both have incred inedibly
strong personalities you just it could
end really badly because there's so many
tales in Tech of that occurring and I
think I think the good new maybe it's
our age you know I I'll just say I'm old
you know like well I was 38 the time I'm
 
age I think maybe we're at a point where
we'd also had
some like soft Landings not wild
successes where we wanted this one to
win when you have a chip on your
shoulder and you want to win and you
feel like you can you just got to work
through some things like you're going to
work through them and and I think we we
have and and yeah great great
relationship today I think it's Key to
Our Success absolutely I want to I want
to touch on the the relationship aspect
and how that has changed as you've built
your exec team so the the Jeff bezos's
quote that I love you know there's
always disagreement especially at the
exec level and I love the quote of
ultimately you're going to you're going
to debate debate debate but then you
have to get on get on board and and his
quote is is will you gamble with me how
do you think about pulling the CEO card
versus trusting your exec team or even
your co-founders to make decisions wow
that it is honestly one of the hardest
things and and I I I'll I'll share
another quote that I think about a lot
that it's aligned with that is I read a
quote from Ben hoods once that said that
if you if all you do as a CEO was always
agree with your leadership team what
value do you have in the room which wow
that's a powerful quote and like you
hire all these High powerered people and
you obviously they they want to be
listened to and respected but like when
do you take that that CEO card and I'll
tell you a handful of examples
one I'm a big in-person person and
anyone who knows me I I've gone on
record many times I I do not believe in
remote work really at all I love being
in the office it's huge for me and
postco we were trying to figure out a
way to come back and I had a lot of
people that told me no to a lot of
things first one user conference oh
shouldn't hold a user comp where people
won't fly to rale we hold it in Raleigh
folks like you have to get on a plane
pretty much most of our customers are
not here um so we rented an outdoor
venue and I just made the decision it
was like we are doing it and we're doing
it this year and it's going to be
outdoors and this is what it's going to
be and I think that really helped the
team next bit decision company kickoff
we bring everyone to Raleigh again fly
everyone in it is like $1.5 million
spend and I can tell you like our CFO
did not want that to happen
and she is a tough human being you know
and smart like and we have a great
relationship but I just and look what's
the ROI of that like getting get like
trust me man like I there's no
spreadsheet that tells you that's like a
good Roi there's Instinct and gut like
we needed to get together we hadn't
gotten together in years it felt like so
so I made that decision and um so that's
another one where I sort of overruled my
team like like rul like I have a
co-founder and my CFO saying we
shouldn't do it and I just make made the
call and we'll say once I made it
everyone got on board and then yeah all
three they're very similar examples an
RTO is another one returned to office
where um there's no question I've been
more active in those conversations than
normal um because I feel I I feel it's
absolutely critical to the future
success of our business and and I'll
take that beted every day and and um
yeah so I think those are areas where I
can tell you Nolan my my my
my mode for this is I listen a lot Bezos
also said recently in a podcast that he
liked to talk last in a meeting and I
don't I'm not always that disciplined
but but it's good advice by the way um
but in those I probably did speak last
and it
honestly I was probably boiling from
within and I realize if I'm boiling from
within me suppressing it is ultimately
bad for the company like if you just
have like an angry Todd walking around
that just like hates the decisions being
made and like like you do not want that
Todd showing up at your office and I
realized it doesn't happen a lot so like
it really doesn't it doesn't happen
every day it doesn't happen every week
um but it happened on those topics and I
realize if I what if I'm not being true
to myself like ultimately company will
fail or needs a different leader and I
still think I'm probably the best leader
for the company at this point Yeah you
mentioned Nan's question the the the CEO
car hard and every example you said Todd
wasn't like a technical product decision
it wasn't even a go to market decision
those decisions have to do with how the
ship is architected how it's sailing
where it's going and the people on the
ship like those are all cultural like I
think that was probably no one's secret
Point asking is these aren't hard black
and white decisions these are very
instinctual culture-based decisions and
I think that leads me to a question for
you which I haven't seen a lot either
especially in technical CEO Founders
I've worked with over the years a very
human element like you carry a very
human element with you know we get spicy
Todd and we get anger yeah but that's
normal but especially in times of high
stress you can surprise everyone with
amazing levels of perspective calm humor
like how do you like what is that
because I haven't seen that blend I've
seen engineering B like based robot CEOs
that don't have that and you I've always
told you this you have a unique blend of
both and I just want to know where that
came from look I think all of this is is
probably learned behavior um you know I
I you mentioned my bio that I worked at
rally software before this and and um I
you know I look I was humbled at that
company a number of times I was like
this high-firing you know
entrepreneurial product leader that came
in and just I I was used to running
people over just trying to be the
smartest person in the room and just
trying to power my way through
conversations and this is like a crunchy
Boulder based culture that did not care
about me and I was acquired in and you
know a number of people took me aside
and you know told me I had to I had to
act differently I had to build
relationship so I had to even if I
didn't necessarily respect every person
in the room I sort of had to find a way
to get these people on my side and um
and I did I invested tremendous I took
people out to dinner I took people out
to lunch I tried to understand where
they're coming from I spent more time
listening than I spent time trying to
run them
over and ultimately it led to more
success and what I realized is that to
be successful at different cultures you
need to adapt your style you can still
be successful in a lot of different
places and still sort of have the impact
that you want but you may need to do it
differently and and when I started pendo
I fortunately kind of I have both I
still have the ability to come into the
room and if I want to have a more sort
of top down or more aggressive I mean
I'm still hard charging and very intense
and things like that but I want to bring
people along I want to listen I want to
understand like what what's holding
people back from being on my side and
how do I Galvanize them and get them on
my side to do it because if they really
believe in it and in some ways if they
think it's their idea even partially
their idea they're GNA be more
passionate about it you're gonna get
more out of them you're ultimately more
successful achieving your outcom and and
I think I've learned a lot also over the
years um to take feedback I was not good
at taking feedback when I was young and
defensive immedately like like and I um
had invested a ton in in like trying to
be good about just ingesting it first
not reacting to it sleeping on it um I
think that's made me obviously a better
leader um Honestly made better partner
and spouse you know like like I think
all these things yeah look the benefit
of being married now my third time you
know like maybe I'm trying to get it
right this time you know I think you
know our personal lives I've got six
children all of which humble me all the
time I think th those those personal
things also have kind of adjusted the
way I approach everything in life hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after a word from our
sponsors here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where

HR heretic sent
 
you so Todd that's a contrarian point of
view from the CEOs that are lionized in
Silicon Valley like Elon doesn't listen
to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anybody Steve Jobs like you
know you get these
archetypes CEOs that are just like it's
my way or the highway like get on board
or get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off the ship and you're
saying the thing that I think that
actually employees really want which is
what one of the things I've met a number
of your uh folks on your exec team and
you have extreme followership and I
think this is like one of the secret
sauces is to like why you have it so how
do you actually like how do you practice
that like does it actually show up
especially if you're hearing feedback
from an exec you know because it's like
that's a dangerous game for the exec
because I've seen it in other in other
companies to where the exec team is
afraid to talk to the CEO and they're
worried about self-preservation and so
how do you think about like creating
that culture and what does it actually
look like in
practice look I look I think there's a
lot of power in being vulnerable and
when you and and I Tred to and and on
several occasions like open meetings
open discussions even open one-on ones
by being vulnerable first like if I am
vulnerable first and I like open that
door it creates an opportunity for
someone to walk into it now now if I
come I'm garded and I come in defensive
no one's coming close to that door but
if I'm I'm yeah I think that's the
biggest thing is opening that door and
and making it you know making it
acceptable to do so now I I'll comment
on this to your question though so I
think I think you know I've read Elon
biography and I I don't know him
personally but really interesting you
know it it a lot of what he does
actually resonated a lot with me like I
I feel like there are there are
consistencies like like setting a really
high bar challenging people to think
bigger and differently you know I think
those are the amazing qualities of Elon
and and I think a lot about that and I I
mean I push people a ton here like if
they give me one number I'm wanting like
double and and so I am similar that I'm
going to push the heck out of you and
strive for more but am going to listen
and I'm not going to tear people down
like randomly and I think I think the
question I had after reading that book
is would Elon be even more successful if
he treated people just like a fraction
better agreed my guess is yes like my
guess is yes because he has extreme
followership too but then he burns it so
like people see the great in him and all
he has to do is give them a little thing
back and he doesn't and I just wonder
how like what is the world missing out
on because he doesn't do that that's the
question I had after finishing that book
probably a lot be at Mars by now there
there is such there is such an
opportunity cost lost on that like yes
they get what they want stick approach
but but it's all transactional it's
probably I get paid a lot to get abused
by Elon and I'm you know making a lot of
money but there's no heart you know it's
it's it's Expendable assets and I will
tell you pendo is probably like the
company I've worked at with the biggest
heart knowing like people are there for
each other I've never from multiple
people never seen anything like it and
that is the difference you don't hear it
in Silicon Valley very often like and
and it's you know it's kind of like
Different Strokes for different folks
kind of a thing because like the people
who do work for Elon are kind of built
out of that cloth but like you know you
Jr I've met the CFO before like you guys
are like real humans and it's like oh
like I'm drawn to that and I think it
has a magnetic effect to other people
like you guys yes and I think I think
early Generations now I think this is
becoming more and more table Stakes I
don't think people are going to put up
with how it was as much I think people
are and maybe they will but they will
lean in first and they will seek out
organizations first where there's that
there's that pendo feeling if you will
versus something just not as great and
you need to make sure we don't like the
problem is how we talk about it CU like
unfort sometimes people they
they associate like this kind of culture
with being passive or not wanting to win
or not being a market leader and no I am
trust me I want to win like every day I
wake up put on my pendo t-shirt and I
want to go dominate the world and we
have a team that wants to down but we
can do it with heart and love and caring
about each other at the same time like
you don't have to sacrifice you can have
both and I think that's the story we
need to tell more like we can win
behaving in this way yeah yeah yeah I
know we're yeah go ahead I I actually
want to take the the the culture aspect
and now move it into hiring you guys are
how many employees now Todd roughly 800
okay so almost a thousand employees
you've been in business for 10 years
raised a lot of money have a very high
valuation talk to me a bit about how
your views on hiring has changed and how
in the weeds are you in hiring yeah yeah
I mean look at historically you know
incredibly in the weeds would be like
the short answer of it and and you know
Kelly will know this but I until she got
here and Jr got here I interviewed every
single employee and that would probably
that probably took us through almost 500
employees so I I did two things I
interviewed every single employee then I
did a oneon-one like a 90day check-in
after their first 90 days to just see
like hey you know has the experience
been as you expected what's different
like what's successful not so that's
just like one it's incredible portion of
my day especially near the end but it
was yeah I was intimately involved in in
um pretty much every hire now I will say
it there was a point where and this is
where like the the relationship with
Eric trone was so important the CTO is
that we did get to a point where it was
him or me on engineering hires and
because what we found in our basically
it's calibration exercise if he likes
someone I like someone and it got to a
point where it was like 100% calibration
and I started El you know eliminating
myself out of that and I still of course
review scorecards and you know pay
attention to things but I have a high
degree um of trust for that but you know
but in the end of the day the rest of
the or like like leaders are changing
all the time like like all sorts of
things are changing and growing
especially in go to market go to
Market's like taking off like a rocket
ship and there's like a new leader
almost every month and a a big why for
me in that wasn't just obviously keeping
the talent bar High and checking in but
you're also it it's like a hack for
understanding like what's this new
leader all about who are they putting in
front of me and then and then I could go
back and say hey why did you put this
candidate in front of me what did you
see that I didn't see or like what are
you looking for in a candidate so I
would use it for coaching often because
you're going very very quickly we didn't
have a lot of training or enablement or
like manage we had no manager training
so I would use it as a way to train our
managers on like this is how I approach
this and let's say we have three
candidates and like here's the pros and
cons and I'd ask them walk me through
your rubric this is how I'm looking at
it you're also ding patterns like
certain people that come from these orgs
don't seem to be the best fit that you
know so you're you're also developing
some pattern matching and like you know
when we're in North Carolina so there's
like three or four large tech companies
we'd hire from like I got a pretty good
sense fast of the companies we wanted to
hire from the companies we did not want
to hire from all because I'm intimately
involved and and every role was a little
different oh that company has great
marketers that company has great you
know bdrs that company has great this so
like some of it's just like a hack for
Speed to sort of understand like the
talent
landscape um so that was a big piece of
it you know now fast forward to today
you know um you know I I basically
approve every offer I interview
certainly every VP and above and some
directors and above for for certain
roles and I like being involved you know
if it's an emerging market or or a new
role I'm often involved and look
I read every scorecard you know I don't
do it a lot I mean it's very very very
rare but I did decline an offer this
week so you know it was interesting you
know it like scorecard was perfectly
filled out everything having but when
you I mean I read them and it's like ask
the person why they wanted to join pendo
and the first one was seems like a cool
software company wants to be in software
and then like you're reading this you
really like like had done no research in
the company didn't have a sense of our
values didn't have passion around our
Market Market in space like no like and
and that's one of the interesting shifts
in hiring we saw in the early days
people want to come here because the
mission and the vision and like like
they believed in it then you get a big
valuation put on you and you get you
know more visibility and all of a sudden
people just want to be at a hot company
Y and and you get a lot of those people
and once it becomes like a little bit
turbulent or they don't see the same
success as they thought they would
because it's a hot company they run they
go on to the next quote unquote hot
company and like so understanding the
why of the candidate I think is
incredibly important so I just declin
that one and go find someone who
actually wants to be here it's a really
basic thing and um not trying to make a
point always but every once in a while
it's sort of helpful to make for for
those listening Todd Founders HR other
other Business Leaders we have in the
audience that might want to start doing
this at earlier stages interviewing
everyone is there any go-tos what do you
scratch at any questions if you're
talking to a senior SDR like what do you
talk to these people about what do you
ask them and look for I mean look I I
think uh obviously if they have a career
you're looking for like job hoppiness
and things like that that's one of the
classic things pretty much every CEO is
going to look at and care about um and
they just have to have good stories
around it like just good stories like
there's gon to be things that don't work
out but I want to really go through it
and and dig deep ultimately I'm looking
for someone with a little bit of grit
and and so I'm looking for give me an
example of like something near you know
life career something that was like
extraordinary like something you're
incredibly proud of something that was
like hard you had to dig deep you know
and you know we we have some people here
that like changed career multiple times
that have gone through real challenges
in life real perseverance we've had like
former professional athletes here that
had like a massive injury in their life
and had to deal with like coming back
from that and like like those are the
kind of people that like tend to like
fight their way through anything and
like those are good they're Builders
they're Scrappy they're gritty they're
really persevere like those are the
kinds of things I'm trying to tease out
and get a lot of stories around it's
less just like oh you're a snowflake you
must be amazing yeah you know that
that's one of the other things like
there are some companies out there in
the world that have incredible product
Market fit and you could be a bozo and
be at that company and massive numbers
and be super successful and like but
you're still a bozo so then you come
here and it's like wow this is hard oh
yeah it's
hard yeah like we're not printing we
don't work on the AdWords team which
like you just hit a button all cash
shows up so like like yeah it's
different you know and and yeah so I
think I think knowing that and kind of
understanding what they did at specific
companies and what their contribution
was and what was hard I mean I think
that's what I'm always looking for yeah
I I think that's so unique we were
talking to Peterson remember Nolan a few
weeks ago and they were running bullion
searches with people that have been
chess Champions as like an input to
searches with these unique skill sets
and ways of looking at problems and life
so interesting I I want to take a
actually this one's for you Kelly so
like I was talking to a friend two weeks
ago she's at a public company she leads
the recruiting team there and she was
complaining to me that the CEO wants to
review every offer and her take was oh
he's like all up my ass and like you
know doesn't trust me and does and my
response back was like what else do you
want him to do like that feels like the
most important thing that he could have
an input on and so Kelly you know you
work at pendo right Todd reviewing
offers he just rejected an offer last
week how do you feel about that yeah
well I I'm going to go ahead and channel
and Shout Out Jr right because when I
started I was a CPO recruiting was like
one piece of like 20 20 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pie
pieces even though we were hiring like
 
I just I congratulate her because she
could have responded like that and do
you know what she told the recruiting
team and we told the whole people team
you think this is a bad thing
yeah like what like the people function
and the force we are in this company is
one of the most important things in
Todd's mind it could be the 180 he could
he didn't even know what ATS you're
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] using let alone looking at who
we're bringing in to this company and so
off the bat Nolan I mean she I credit
her again she celebrated that um and I
think it's a great thing now and also I
would say people respond like that the
the first thing people do when they kind
of want to push people away is they get
scared right they get scared that like
their house is in order people are
looking and Todd's a guy it's like if I
don't if I don't trust something and
it's not going well I'm gonna dig in
harder so like if you if you have your
stuff together and you feel great about
your process I invite everyone in right
it's just nothing but helpful the only
thing I will say is that scale it can
become a bottleneck it can become hard
when you've got I don't know again 600
net s a year it can become a lot so but
I don't think a CEO should not be
involved there's like look at like the
DUI checkpoints they don't test every
car they test three of 10 that go
through so I applaud a sampling which I
think you can get the same effect um as
right the time it takes to do every
single I also think what Todd's saying
though is he's willing to make the
trade-off of moving slower so he can
actually like peek in and see what's
going on is that right Todd yeah this is
the classic thing everyone knows this
it's like the classic adage in Silicon
Valley higher slow Fire fast right
everyone says that so few companies do
it they're in a rush to higher and
someone like on a performance plan and
we like oh pip it once pip it twice now
it's two quarters three quarters like
well they did a little bit better like
no we ignore this advice constantly as
as an industry and and I had a deck in
front of me last to to question whether
I should interview a candidate or not
and one of the cons was tax on T time
and and all I said to the person was if
we get this higher wrong do you realize
theack on my time would be like a
hundred times more than an interview
like a 100 times Ser this is one of
these roles where like I know if it went
bad like it had been like highly
stressful for me and take like probably
hours and hours and hours and hours out
of my time so I was like no I'll
definitely not to mention the dollars
right the dollars boom boom boom yeah
look I think um yeah I'm willing to yeah
look it does mean that I'm Lally telled
to my computer like I
I me even on vacation I'm improving
offers which is fine I mean like it's it
again not something I spent a lot of
time and I mean I'm reading the
scorecards it's not like it's Moby Dick
folks like it's like are
short I can rock through it pretty
quickly you know uh um so uh yeah I
think it's fine so and in this macro
it's you know take advantage of it we
aren't hiring 600 people a year but I do
want to ask about executive go ahead
finish but I want to go to exact hiring
real quick I I was actually going to go
to the same topic so I'll let you lead
mind meld so on the on the topic of
hiring Todd we you know since my time at
pendo we you we've hired a ton of
Executives in the company even C team
members some have worked some haven't um
a lot of people like to think that
hiring a CA Lev member is a 50% 50% work
out 50% don't and you live with that and
I just love to know one your thoughts on
that and just your learning the last 10
years maybe the last three years
specifically on hiring CT members what
that looks like for
you I mean yeah it's like the hardest
thing of all the things you know and the
most important thing because like you
hire like a c te member then you're
gonna give them rope like I don't know a
CEO that you can't not give them rope so
you're G to give them a lot of rope and
then they go hire a bunch of people they
put in some process and like if it
doesn't work out it's going to be like a
crazy crazy amount of work to fix it and
undo it and change it so like it is the
most important thing to spend time on
and and the hardest thing and then at
some at some levels like you're just get
something wrong so so what what's worked
for me and I've had like and honestly in
some cases just been lucky you know we
hired our CFO in
 
and I mean honestly got lucky I I think
I know what I was looking for I think
the general conventional wisdom in our
businesses is you look at kind of where
you are and where you want to go and you
try to hire someone that's kind of like
seen that been there done that you know
so it's like 10 to 100 or 50 to 100 or
it's 100 to 500 like like I mean Kelly
you had just seen in a looker and we
hired you in as Chief people officer I
knew that you could just replicate what
you did looker and you know how to do it
you're gonna bring in playbooks you're
going to bring in people you're gonna
like and you just prove that you can do
it and then the other thing about like a
looker that's actually a very good
example here is I I knew the CEO I mean
not super well like best friends but I I
knew the CEO I knew the investors I knew
culturally the companies were similar in
a way that I I felt confident that like
there was a like U and look it's a it's
not like in the heart of Silicon Valley
it's you know it's on the coast it's
like a little bit hippie and different
like like and I I I think that made it I
I I knew that it's G to be more like a
little more authentic a little more like
real like real people and I thought that
that would just be a good fit that's an
example I got it right
obviously now what we've learned now is
that just spend a lot of time with the
executive so we now do like these
exercises and it's not like like work
per se but it's like a half day and like
a whiteboard session and like try to
work through something and see like how
engaging it is I I I have a sense now
for like what's really important to me
and what's not really really important
to me um know I try to be direct around
how I'm going to behave and I encourage
other people to say you know go talk to
other directs about what's worked and
what's not and and and hear directly
from them I I'm an open book like I'm
unafraid for you to hear The Good the
Bad and the Ugly so like I'm not trying
to sell you per se rather I want to make
sure it's just a really good fit but
yeah I think Executive hiring is is
really really really difficult so you
know and here's the key don't rush it I
think the biggest issue you get into and
unfortunately I've had this experience
is that you get a couple of candidates
neither are the right candidate they're
both good probably good for different
situations and but they're not right for
you and you make a decision anyway
that's the hardest thing because then
you have pressure from a recruiter well
you know not a lot of people in the
market right now these are two pretty
hirable candidates and they sort of did
get you to your process and this search
is starting to take a while you know so
but my biggest advice to people is like
don't give in if you don't feel like
they're like 100% great for you don't
don't give in and then also step back
and find out what's really important to
you and and look I'll give the most
recent search we had you know as an
example I feel comfortable talking about
it but you know Will May is our most
recent cro and we got through the
process and like everyone was feeling
really good about him but but there was
some reticence over his age you know
he's a young guy you know a lot of
conversation around it to be quite
honest and and finally I steep back and
like look if you could hire me at that
age would you have and the answer was
well hell yeah would that been a good
decision yeah probably like probably
really decision because if you go back
 
company and that would have been a good
call you know like so I am now going to
treat this person differently than I
would have should have been treated oh
that's a shitty reason not to hire
someone isn't it so he checks every
other box you feel really good about the
hire and that's when you really
understand what's important to you and
what's not sometimes we get caught up
into what company they worked at or what
age they are what like like honestly
unimportant like like superficial vanity
things and not like what's the chemistry
like like digging into like the details
around how they handle certain scenarios
focus on what's really really matters
and like look so you know things are
working out well and and I feel like I
made the right call and just takes you
know stepping back to to make these
sorts of decisions on that Todd like
we've had both right it's just in my my
tenure with you we've had folks that
have worked out really well and not and
for those those leaders that are
listening that are new to hiring execs
or C team members like let's just say
the first 90 days like what would you
offer them as far as things that you can
see touch and feel where you know all
right like this this train is grasping
the track and we're good versus oh man
it's derailing like one or two things
that you'd offer them that you're seeing
that are good signs and not so good
signs yeah look I I think you want first
of all it's a lot about the relationship
with the exact that to me is like number
one like how is this person interacting
with you and there's two types of people
there's a I'm going to lock arms with
you and I want to on board together and
I want to learn how to be successful at
pendo and I'm G to talk to you as much
as I can and I'm gon to share you what
I'm learning and what you're learning
and we're going to work together through
this and there's other people that are
like I've got this leave me alone I'm
gonna go to in a hole with my team we're
going to come up with this plan and then
I'll just tell you what I'm going to do
that's a very bad sign anyone who just
tells you what they're going to do after
like going dark and like meeting
secretly with a bunch of people and not
including you in it it's incredibly
dangerous you want someone who realizes
it's the partnership you know I win if
they win and they win if I win like we
win together like that is it so like I
think so often execs are like you know
they're they feel like there's like some
expectation on them they they know
everything that's going on they can just
come in and they'll just take it off my
plate no I want to be on the bus with
you and so I think I think bringing you
along and having really open dialogue
back and forth is really really good I
mean one of the another good example
when you know the Jr example of coming
in and you came in it's like look in
order to hit our
plan we need to do referral bonuses I
don't believe in referral bonuses we
never had them it's like I need this now
look like this is someone within their
first 90 days telling me something I
simp do not believe in is necessary to
hit my goal but at least there was a
point of view and at least there was a
two-way conversation and she asked it
wasn't like she just like did it
secretly and like didn't tell me like
some exec try to do that oh I just
handled this without telling you I
didn't think you'd want to be in the
details on this or not know about it no
it was brought to my attention she knew
it was like a cultural like hot button
for me and we had a really open
conversation around and a two-way
conversation around it and like that's
what you want you want directness you
want how are they going to treat you are
they comfortable coming to you and
bringing something controversial in the
first 90 days something they know I care
about because invariably there's G to be
something here that is from the past
that people think may be sacred to me
that like they're comfort of coming to
me and having that direct conversation
it's going to matter a lot so how direct
and comfortable are they with me that's
one of the biggest signs to me you know
and um when that's when the directness
is there early you're going to have a
good relationship when they're kind of
scared or timid or like they sort of do
things p and you hear in the Great Vine
blah blah blah is doing this or said
this oh massive warning signs and I
think you see both yep what I what I
love about the will story is one of the
things we used to say at door Dash was
hell yes or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no and it sounds like
you were 100% like a hell yes the other
thing is that nobody's perfect and
especially with exec like we we have
this like unicorn in mind every time we
write the job description and then you
interact with real humans and it turns
out like we all have areas in which we
Spike and areas in which we need to grow
and as somebody who is also a young exec
one I love that you took the bet just
from a bias standpoint but two there's
ways that you can then round out those
skill gaps with either coaching from you
or coaching from others or mentors
outside of the organization and so I
would just encourage all leaders to
listen to how you made that decision on
somebody understanding that nobody's
perfect and then trying to round out
their gaps 100% totally I I want to talk
about HR because it's a it's a very
interesting time as we think about
people and people operations in in
 
narrative right now in Silicon Valley
that HR just mucks everything up that
they over complicate everything that
they're bringing things into the
organization that don't actually help
the business achieve
goals there's a lot of layoffs right now
in HR there's a lot of CEOs that that
believe that they can do without HR shth
just talked about this on Allin recently
what's your view on that Todd well
probably don't listen to shth so that's
probably first first recommendation but
oh look I I think of course depend like
the level of HR you need depends on your
scale I will say that so what we have at
 
or 30 so I think obviously it is size
adjustable but but at size and scale we
it you would be far slower if you didn't
have HR and and I'll tell you why like
like there are laws in the world and you
need to treat people consistently and
and and if you are going through
something like a layoff there's a way to
do it right and there's a way to do it
wrong and if you are undisciplined
sloppy unorganized and you start trying
to do a layoff and just think oh it's
just getting rid of people I'm sure it's
easy it could have devastating
ramifications for your business you
could lose people who you don't want to
lose unintentionally because of the way
you treated the person that was sitting
next to him yesterday right like like
people think that okay you have very
high performers sitting next to maybe a
lower performer and that both these
people understand that one's high and
one's low and then they somehow aren't
friends and they aren't buddies and they
don't what they don't have lunch
together they don't know about their
spouses or their dogs or whatever no
these people work right next to each
other then you treat one person
terribly do you think it w have an
impact on the person next to him you
were lying to yourself like and so the
way people come into your org people
people about onboarding package they
send you like boxes with like swag and
like cool things then when we offboard
you what like we like no you can judge a
company about how will they onboard and
offboard a human being period And if
they offboard people well and
respectfully and professionally that
doesn't mean to spend a ton of money on
it like people say you know you can
still be budget conscious but you can
still on board people professionally
treat them like human beings
like help them get their next
opportunity if you can and you have the
the skills to do it I think it really
really matters today and you know even
been like I've Ben horor kick today but
hard things about hard things he talks
about HR having to shift from one that
can you know essentially hire really
quickly to one that can execute layoffs
but and look no one wants to do a layoff
like you think I started a company to
lay people off like no it's absolutely
last thing to do it but if we're going
to do one because we simply have to do
it because it makes economic sense and I
have a fiducia responsible
responsibility to my shareholders we're
going to do it consistent with our
culture because guess what we're gonna
need to hire again in a few months
probably or maybe hopefully if things
turn or the market INF Flex like we're
going to have to continue hiring and um
the way we do this is GNA get noticed in
the industry and the market and people
talk so yeah no I think I think it it
matters a lot it matters a lot more I
think I have an a lot of respect for HR
business partners and what they did what
they do day in day out because here's
the deal like your employ like your the
brand of your company could be impacted
by the quality of your firstline
managers and it often is like people
talk about this all the time people
leave their they don't leave jobs they
leave firstline managers often so um if
you have a newly promoted firstline
manager that is scared to give feedback
to their direct reports and then one day
the direct report shows up and just gets
terminated unexpectedly and maybe the
right thing for the company yes that you
know person may not be a high performer
but the first line manager cannot give
feedback one that's a terrible employee
experience the person could
complain worse you could get an e OC
complaint which by the way is going to
take a lot more time and a lot more
energy out of your company and slow you
down way the hell more than just
properly executing on feedback
documenting it doing it the right it
doesn't have to be slower it just has to
be done well that's it like like it
actually helps you go faster if you have
good Management training if you have
solid hrbps that are taking them like
you're end up you're actually G to move
faster because you can move more swiftly
with confidence that you're not going to
have some devastating ramification at
the other end and I think that's how I
think about it and I think we've been
good here like actually quite good are
we perfect no I don't think any
company's perfect and when you have a
lot of Frontline managers yes we're
working with all of them and we're going
to make all of them as good as we can
but like you have Folks at different
levels in their Learning Journey but I
think that that to me is like where the
rubber hits the road like it's it's
right there and HR is critical to kind
of help you get all those Frontline
managers where you want them to I've had
probably like I don't know dozens of
conversations over the last five six
seven years with founder CEO
specifically Todd that ask me hey I'm
hiring a head of people Chi people
officer for the first or maybe second
time because the first one was not the
right hire like what do I ask how do I
how do I tell it's the right HR person
because you know you guys aren't
thinking about HR people 10 years ago
when you started this company and they
really want to know like besides the
nuts and bolts of the usual [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like
how do I know I'm getting the right HR
leader like what have you learned maybe
how would you interview differently
tomorrow versus five years ago if you HR
leader for you specifically correct I
think you know go back to what I said I
interviewed every person up to 500 that
I met with every single employee after
the first 90 days think about that think
about how much time it was and and why
did I do that well obviously I knew
people were important and I felt like I
wasn't getting a pulse at the time
without me personally doing it so what's
a great I mean a great HR leader is
giving me that pulse without me doing
all that work and or or or helping
direct me on where I should be spending
my time because I shouldn't it probably
shouldn't go from every employee to zero
that's probably probably too much of a
Band-Aid Rip but you want someone that
can still get that pulse check of like
where are my hot spots in the Y because
that's what I'm looking for oh I got a
hot spot over here maybe maybe that's an
area where I need to pay a little more
attention to I need to start looking at
that management chain and figuring
what's going on or I need to ask my
direct in that next one-on-one like
what's going on over here like just help
me out like come like something smells a
little off like that's what I'm looking
for out of an HR leader like and
ultimately it's where people are having
a are driving impact for our business I
think the other thing you want is a
leader that comes in that is a true CT
member they're not just a GNA function
that's a support function they have a
point of view they have a they have a
you know a goal for the year like you
you want you want one that's coming in
that's doing their own qbrs that's
having their own kind of okrs for the
year and for the quarter and like this
is our vision for the year for the
people of pendo and here's how we're
breaking it down quarter by quarter and
just like you'd expect out of a product
leader or a sales leader I I think you
need to be holding your HR leaders to
the same standards you hold every single
other executive on your C team too I
think that's the key I think often
people are just like oh they're please
hire everyone and just make sure
everyone's happy you know like that if
that's how you're relegating it that's
not a true business executive like that
to me is is where that differences and I
think that's what I'm hiring for now I
want I want someone sitting at the table
like I I want to go tackle International
like like what's our strategy for either
combination of employee branding and
talent acquisition internationally how
are we thinking about it right you know
I want I want this new product area like
AI is hot how the hell are we gonna
compete with open Ai and meta for AI
Talent y like give me a strategy like
like we have something to offer of
course but let's talk through a strategy
where we can go go win and go attract
the right kind of people to our company
uh and what's our story in doing that I
think those the kinds of strategic
conversations I think HR absolutely has
an impact on the business and and it's
critical if you can't find those people
in this market you may not win yeah
right so I think that that's kind of how
we think about it cool I love that Todd
this has been awesome I thoroughly enjoy
this conversation thanks for taking the
time man my pleasure man thanks HR
