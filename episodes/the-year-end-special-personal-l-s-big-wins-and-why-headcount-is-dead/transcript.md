in these terms what you throw Riz out
 
in these terms what you throw Riz out
there too like Risk on RI Riz what are
 
there too like Risk on RI Riz what are
we talk risk on baby I live on Twitter
 
we talk risk on baby I live on Twitter
all right here's my prediction so I
 
all right here's my prediction so I
think in general hiring will increase
 
think in general hiring will increase
but you will see at Company by company
 
but you will see at Company by company
headcount will stay
 
headcount will stay
flat and so how does hiring increase if
 
flat and so how does hiring increase if
headcount stays flat I think there's
 
headcount stays flat I think there's
just going to be more formations of new
 
just going to be more formations of new
companies and this is what I mean
 
companies and this is what I mean
partially by risk on is I think we're
 
partially by risk on is I think we're
going to see more early stage companies
 
going to see more early stage companies
those companies will grow until they
 
those companies will grow until they
reach like this point of like all right
 
reach like this point of like all right
we now have to like get going for
 
we now have to like get going for
profitability and I think that
 
profitability and I think that
profitability like Avenue comes earlier
 
profitability like Avenue comes earlier
now in a company's life cycle like now
 
now in a company's life cycle like now
it's around series C Series D when you
 
it's around series C Series D when you
have to get real about like your
 
have to get real about like your
headcount costs and so I think that's
 
headcount costs and so I think that's
the point to where you're going to start
 
the point to where you're going to start
to see these companies flatten out from
 
to see these companies flatten out from
a head count perspective but up until
 
a head count perspective but up until
then it's grow baby grow from seed all
 
then it's grow baby grow from seed all
the way through series C I also think
 
the way through series C I also think
the technolog is going to make it less
 
the technolog is going to make it less
cool to be big right it was like oh how
 
cool to be big right it was like oh how
many people do you have it's going to be
 
many people do you have it's going to be
cooler to be small head count is a
 
cooler to be small head count is a
vanity metric exactly like headcount is
 
vanity metric exactly like headcount is
a vanity metric that's definitely like a
 
a vanity metric that's definitely like a
I think that one's actually already done
 
I think that one's actually already done
for 2024 okay the other one I agree with
 
for 2024 okay the other one I agree with
you I think SAS seat based pricing which
 
you I think SAS seat based pricing which
is what we've had for all of SAS dies in
 
is what we've had for all of SAS dies in
favor of results based pricing yes it
 
favor of results based pricing yes it
it's you could just very clearly see it
 
it's you could just very clearly see it
now with AI like AI is actually it's
 
now with AI like AI is actually it's
kind of expensive to run underneath the
 
kind of expensive to run underneath the
hood and so these SAS companies are
 
hood and so these SAS companies are
going to start charging based off of
 
going to start charging based off of
results and try to take a rake off of
 
results and try to take a rake off of
those results my next prediction is
 
those results my next prediction is
someone is finally going to crack AI in
 
someone is finally going to crack AI in
the applicant tracking system like it's
 
the applicant tracking system like it's
insane to me that I can't find great
 
insane to me that I can't find great
talent that applies to my company

I know Ashley's already taken a crack at
this but somebody's GNA crack it's true
 
this but somebody's GNA crack it's true
it's GNA happen the best candidates are
 
it's GNA happen the best candidates are
going to float to the top we don't need
 
going to float to the top we don't need
to go through these back doors or side
 
to go through these back doors or side
doors anymore like some applicant
 
doors anymore like some applicant
tracking system is going to figure out
 
tracking system is going to figure out
that problem this year I think I think
 
that problem this year I think I think
we're going to see a lot more AI
 
we're going to see a lot more AI
