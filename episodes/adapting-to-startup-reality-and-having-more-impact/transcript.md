who work at later stage companies being
like Oh I could come in and kill it at
 
like Oh I could come in and kill it at
an early stage company and it's a
 
an early stage company and it's a
completely different world and what I
 
completely different world and what I
love about this person is they already
 
love about this person is they already
have the self-awareness which is step
 
have the self-awareness which is step
one to understand like what you know and
 
one to understand like what you know and
what you don't know and so I think that
 
what you don't know and so I think that
is like step one going into this is
 
is like step one going into this is
always be aware of your gaps have the
 
always be aware of your gaps have the
self-awareness to say this is what I
 
self-awareness to say this is what I
need help with and then go try and and
 
need help with and then go try and and
surround yourself with people who can
 
surround yourself with people who can
round out those gaps so step two then is
 
round out those gaps so step two then is
like really understand like what are you
 
like really understand like what are you
walking into and you know Kelly we've
 
walking into and you know Kelly we've
talked quite a bit about like
 
talked quite a bit about like
interviewing and I think early stage
 
interviewing and I think early stage
companies you have to be really really
 
companies you have to be really really
careful about what you learn in the
 
careful about what you learn in the
interview process I I don't think
 
interview process I I don't think
they're being malicious I just think
 
they're being malicious I just think
they're really bad at it and then they
 
they're really bad at it and then they
end up they they tend to get into the
 
end up they they tend to get into the
mode of I want to hire you and so I have
 
mode of I want to hire you and so I have
now stopped telling you all of the bad
 
now stopped telling you all of the bad
things about this place and I just tell
 
things about this place and I just tell
you all the good things and I'm like in
 
you all the good things and I'm like in
recruit and close at all cost mode and
 
recruit and close at all cost mode and
so it is impendent upon you to
 
so it is impendent upon you to
understand what's actually going on
 
understand what's actually going on
there number three is is to understand
 
there number three is is to understand
everything you have learned at a large
 
everything you have learned at a large
Stage Company is not applicable at an
 
Stage Company is not applicable at an
early stage company for example you will
 
early stage company for example you will
be flying at 70,000 ft that's the same I
 
be flying at 70,000 ft that's the same I
guess but you're also going to be
 
guess but you're also going to be
required to do the actual work you are
 
required to do the actual work you are
not going to have a large team under you
 
not going to have a large team under you
at 300 people you might have like two
 
at 300 people you might have like two
people on your team you might have zero
 
people on your team you might have zero
HR resources because the company is like
 
HR resources because the company is like
only focused on recruiting right now and
 
only focused on recruiting right now and

so are you actually prepared to do the
work and then I would say like number
 
work and then I would say like number
four before I turn it over to you is the
 
four before I turn it over to you is the
most important thing at any early stage
 
most important thing at any early stage
company when you're joining as an
 
company when you're joining as an
executive is the relationship with the
 
executive is the relationship with the
founder and that is something that you
 
founder and that is something that you
know I always say time cannot be
 
know I always say time cannot be
replaced you need to spend time with
 
replaced you need to spend time with

each other works and you're going to
 
each other works and you're going to
have an opportunity to build a
 
have an opportunity to build a
relationship before you start because
 
relationship before you start because
ultimately that relationship if it's not
 
ultimately that relationship if it's not

to know about about now but like there
was so much bias on bigger company
 
was so much bias on bigger company
people going to smaller early stage
 
people going to smaller early stage
companies and then those people going to
 
companies and then those people going to
bigger companies and I don't like it
