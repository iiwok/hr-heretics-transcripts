building helping CEOs build leadership
 
building helping CEOs build leadership
teams like a lot of what I talk about is

with John Carson at stripe and I and and
 
with John Carson at stripe and I and and

I was just I just casually said you know
look there's so much churn in early
 
look there's so much churn in early
stage executive teams it's one of the
 
stage executive teams it's one of the
most painful phases and and really most
 
most painful phases and and really most
leaders don't last more than um than two
 
leaders don't last more than um than two
years and it's I would say it's the
 
years and it's I would say it's the
exception not the rule right the
 
exception not the rule right the
exception is the leader that lasts
 
exception is the leader that lasts
longer than two years um and deserves it
 
longer than two years um and deserves it
because sometimes CEOs are just wusses
 
because sometimes CEOs are just wusses

and won't fire the person but um John
said to me uh you know that really
 
said to me uh you know that really
calmed down for us after a thousand
 
calmed down for us after a thousand
employees and and then I
 
employees and and then I
reflected on it and realized that was
 
reflected on it and realized that was
true for Facebook too like Facebook had
 
true for Facebook too like Facebook had
a huge amount of turn in the first um
 
a huge amount of turn in the first um
the first thousand employees and then
 
the first thousand employees and then
they built a leadership team Cheryl and
 
they built a leadership team Cheryl and
Mark that stayed forever like that it
 
Mark that stayed forever like that it
was the same people for 10 years I think
 
was the same people for 10 years I think
um and that so anyway I think there's
 
um and that so anyway I think there's
just a huge amount of turn and somewhat
 
just a huge amount of turn and somewhat
rightly so if you're growing quickly um
 
rightly so if you're growing quickly um
in the sense that like it's just hard
 
in the sense that like it's just hard
for someone to be as good at sort of the
 
for someone to be as good at sort of the
like 5 million to 20 million to 50
 
like 5 million to 20 million to 50
million as they are at 100 million plus
 
million as they are at 100 million plus
in terms of Revenue and then you know
 
in terms of Revenue and then you know
similarly like if you're not growing
 
similarly like if you're not growing

sometimes you're you've got people
hitting the wrong nail with the wrong
 
hitting the wrong nail with the wrong
tool you know they're using a p Pony
 
tool you know they're using a p Pony

this thing like great I'll find the
right person or I'll build the right
 
right person or I'll build the right
team under me or whatever you know that
 
team under me or whatever you know that

that but when they do that's when it's
magical you had mentioned your hit rate
 
magical you had mentioned your hit rate
being 50% and I I tend to agree like
 
being 50% and I I tend to agree like
mine's in that neighborhood as well um I
 
mine's in that neighborhood as well um I
have found that most CEOs and and most
 
have found that most CEOs and and most
managers in general move too slow to
 
managers in general move too slow to
move people out why do you think that is
 
move people out why do you think that is
and like what can they do to move faster

uh managing up down and sideways I have
 
uh managing up down and sideways I have
this great picture of a very
 
this great picture of a very
disappointed turtle that tells people to
 
disappointed turtle that tells people to
fire people um the reason is because
 
fire people um the reason is because
basically no matter how senior of a
 
basically no matter how senior of a
manager you are and no matter how many
 
manager you are and no matter how many
people you fired you spend a significant
 
people you fired you spend a significant
chunk of time thinking that it's you
 
chunk of time thinking that it's you
thinking that it's your fault that that
 
thinking that it's your fault that that
the person's not performing and that it
 
the person's not performing and that it
and and I feel like that causes you to
 
and and I feel like that causes you to
be like if only I could just tweak these
 
be like if only I could just tweak these
things then this person would finally
 
things then this person would finally
perform and and the truth is the more
 
perform and and the truth is the more
senior you get the longer you've done
 
senior you get the longer you've done
this the thing that you start to know is
 
this the thing that you start to know is
that as soon as you have that feeling
 
that as soon as you have that feeling
that something's wrong you need to start
 
that something's wrong you need to start
to do the work to figure out what's
 
to do the work to figure out what's
wrong um and I and and one of the things
 
wrong um and I and and one of the things
I was talking to that group of people
 
I was talking to that group of people
about yesterday is just like I
 
about yesterday is just like I
um I really believe that hiring has two
 
um I really believe that hiring has two
parts the first is finding the right
 
parts the first is finding the right
person or what I call making educated
 
person or what I call making educated
bets on people so you're making an
 
bets on people so you're making an
educated bet on someone the other side
 
educated bet on someone the other side
of the bet is how are you going to know
 
of the bet is how are you going to know
if it was right which means you need to
 
if it was right which means you need to
have that answer before the person
 
have that answer before the person
starts in two months and I'm I use a
 
starts in two months and I'm I use a
two-month time Horizon how would you
 
two-month time Horizon how would you
know if this person is working out as
 
know if this person is working out as
well as you thought they would better or
 
well as you thought they would better or
worse and I you need to scope all three
 
worse and I you need to scope all three
um in your mind all you need to do is
 
um in your mind all you need to do is
sit down and just visualize it okay what
 
sit down and just visualize it okay what
would I feel like in 60 days if this
 
would I feel like in 60 days if this
person was working out as well as I
 
person was working out as well as I
think they're going to I made a bet that
 
think they're going to I made a bet that
they're the person I think they are how
 
they're the person I think they are how
and and that can be numbers but not a
 
and and that can be numbers but not a
there's not you not every number moves
 
there's not you not every number moves
in two months so like this is the hard
 
in two months so like this is the hard
thing about sales leaders um but there's
 
thing about sales leaders um but there's
a lot of tangible things like oh I would
 
a lot of tangible things like oh I would
feel like the team was they had a handle
 
feel like the team was they had a handle
on the team and they were firing some
 
on the team and they were firing some
people moving some people out and
 
people moving some people out and
figuring out what leadership they needed
 
figuring out what leadership they needed
to bring in maybe they've brought some
 
to bring in maybe they've brought some
people in already I would feel like I
 
people in already I would feel like I
didn't have to worry about X Y and Z I
 
didn't have to worry about X Y and Z I
would feel like I would see xpq
 
would feel like I would see xpq
happening with my leadership team where
 
happening with my leadership team where
they had built relationships with the
 
they had built relationships with the
following people you can list this is
 
following people you can list this is
what it feel you can visualize and then
 
what it feel you can visualize and then
and then write out and then you can give
 
and then write out and then you can give
it to them you can say hey like here's
 
it to them you can say hey like here's
what I want to see in 60 days you don't
 
what I want to see in 60 days you don't
have to give them the whole list but you
 
have to give them the whole list but you
can give them some set of lists and
 
can give them some set of lists and
that's part of setting expectations for
 
that's part of setting expectations for
someone when they start this is what
 
someone when they start this is what
success looks like this is what I what
 
success looks like this is what I what
matters to me and then ask them to bring
 
matters to me and then ask them to bring
you a plan hey what are you going to do
 
you a plan hey what are you going to do
in the first 30 60 90 days whatever but
 
in the first 30 60 90 days whatever but
like I think often we stop at hiring
 
like I think often we stop at hiring
we're like Victory like I found the
 
we're like Victory like I found the
perfect person all done and um then
 
perfect person all done and um then
somehow we're surprised when half the
 
somehow we're surprised when half the
people struggle at two months or three
 
people struggle at two months or three
months or whatever and so it takes us
 
months or whatever and so it takes us
six or nine months to get rid of someone
 
six or nine months to get rid of someone
and by that time you've lost a lot of
 
and by that time you've lost a lot of
momentum you they've they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the
 
momentum you they've they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the
team they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the business I think
 
team they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the business I think
planning for the 50% matters to your
 
planning for the 50% matters to your
point figuring that out early right
 
point figuring that out early right
because if someone's N9 months in and
 
because if someone's N9 months in and
they're kind of struggling replacing
 
they're kind of struggling replacing
that person's very stressful and
 
that person's very stressful and
sometimes it can put the business back
 
sometimes it can put the business back
at least 12 months and so you want to
 
at least 12 months and so you want to
hang on to that person like try try like
 
hang on to that person like try try like
held and make it work yeah and I think I
 
held and make it work yeah and I think I
think there's value in in second
 
think there's value in in second
guessing yourself you know but to be
 
guessing yourself you know but to be
honest I've don't think I've ever had a
 
honest I've don't think I've ever had a
conversation with someone where they
 
conversation with someone where they
were like oh I I fired that person too
 
were like oh I I fired that person too
fast like should have slowed down like
 
fast like should have slowed down like
I've just never had that conversation
 
I've just never had that conversation
it's always like man should have done
 
it's always like man should have done
that n months ago I think that that is
 
that n months ago I think that that is
partially just because it takes us a
 
partially just because it takes us a
long time to to sort out what's really
 
long time to to sort out what's really
going wrong and and to some extent to
 
going wrong and and to some extent to
stop blaming ourselves or trying to fix
 
stop blaming ourselves or trying to fix

at the end of the day is like laying a
 
at the end of the day is like laying a
foundation for a conversation with

someone around like what you expect of
 
someone around like what you expect of
them and then having a conversation over
 
them and then having a conversation over
time about how they're doing relative to
 
time about how they're doing relative to
those expectations and if you're not
 
those expectations and if you're not
having that conversation then you end up
 
having that conversation then you end up
having either a a very long process of
 
having either a a very long process of
firing somebody B surprising them like
 
firing somebody B surprising them like

in the time that I need you know like
 
in the time that I need you know like
maybe we could fix it if we had six
 
maybe we could fix it if we had six

good I love your framework of setting
 
good I love your framework of setting
the expectation for yourself before you
 
the expectation for yourself before you
hire somebody and two months from now
 
hire somebody and two months from now
how will I how will I measure if I'm
 
how will I how will I measure if I'm
feeling if this is good or not good or
 
feeling if this is good or not good or
if it's working or not um I love that
 
if it's working or not um I love that
I'm going to start making everybody do
 
I'm going to start making everybody do
that before they make hires I do it at
 
that before they make hires I do it at
the beginning where you're scoping the
 
the beginning where you're scoping the
role and then at the end once you've
 
role and then at the end once you've
hired the person and I love the quality
 
hired the person and I love the quality
of that aspect of that totally like what
 
of that aspect of that totally like what
does what does it feel like what's going
 
does what does it feel like what's going
on on what's the vibe of this person
 
on on what's the vibe of this person
after two months that is just as
 
after two months that is just as
important to your point about the what
 
important to your point about the what
and the how totally we that's it's such
 
and the how totally we that's it's such
a good point Kelly like at Google we
 
a good point Kelly like at Google we
tried to do all this stuff to remove
 
tried to do all this stuff to remove
bias and I I think one of the things we
 
bias and I I think one of the things we
swung so hard to kind of just be robots
 
swung so hard to kind of just be robots
and I actually think like especially
 
and I actually think like especially
with executive level hiring like you
 
with executive level hiring like you
have to lean into
 
have to lean into
feelings yeah if they don't win the
 
feelings yeah if they don't win the
hearts and minds of the people that are
 
hearts and minds of the people that are
executing you're you're screwed I have
 
executing you're you're screwed I have
one more quick one for you Molly what is
 
one more quick one for you Molly what is
the biggest misconception are you seeing
 
the biggest misconception are you seeing
Founders having around HR leader roles
 
Founders having around HR leader roles
Chief people officers what are you
 
Chief people officers what are you
telling them
 
telling them
interesting can I rephrase the question
 
interesting can I rephrase the question

it's interesting the I'll just tell you
what I want to what I the question I
 
what I want to what I the question I
want to answer which is like what am I
 
want to answer which is like what am I
seeing Founders want and ask for that
 
seeing Founders want and ask for that
maybe isn't as common in the HR space
 
maybe isn't as common in the HR space
every founder I talk to right now wants
 
every founder I talk to right now wants
an operational head of people meaning
 
an operational head of people meaning
they want a head of people that thinks
 
they want a head of people that thinks
about the business
 
about the business
and understands the business and
 
and understands the business and
understands that at the end of the day
 
understands that at the end of the day
they're not responsible for employee
 
they're not responsible for employee
happiness they're responsible for one of
 
happiness they're responsible for one of
the largest budget budget items inside
 
the largest budget budget items inside
the company um they're responsible for
 
the company um they're responsible for
unit economics because at the end of the
 
unit economics because at the end of the
day like most companies most software
 
day like most companies most software
companies the two biggest expenses are
 
companies the two biggest expenses are
people and servers um you know obviously
 
people and servers um you know obviously
if you have like a retail business
 
if you have like a retail business
there's other costs but if people are
 
there's other costs but if people are
the biggest expense inside of a company
 
the biggest expense inside of a company
how do you as a people leader think
 
how do you as a people leader think
about running that at the process of
 
about running that at the process of
filling those seats well um and being
 
filling those seats well um and being
economically and fiscally responsible to
 
economically and fiscally responsible to
the business and the business that needs
 
the business and the business that needs
to be built um I think sometimes
 
to be built um I think sometimes
we uh have focused so much on happiness
 
we uh have focused so much on happiness
that we forgotten that everybody's going
 
that we forgotten that everybody's going
to be unhappy if there's no business and
 
to be unhappy if there's no business and
uh I see Founders pretty desperate for
 
uh I see Founders pretty desperate for
partnership that understands that at the
 
partnership that understands that at the
end of the day this is a business and if
 
end of the day this is a business and if
the business doesn't work which there's
 
the business doesn't work which there's
a lot of these days um no one has a job
 
a lot of these days um no one has a job
so I think that like for me if I were
 
so I think that like for me if I were
like gift something to the the sort of
 
like gift something to the the sort of
people leaders of the world it would be
 
people leaders of the world it would be
an understanding that everything has to
 
an understanding that everything has to
be business first um that doesn't mean
 
be business first um that doesn't mean
you people can't be happy I actually
 
you people can't be happy I actually
think people like winning number one
 
think people like winning number one
grow solves all problems right like
 
grow solves all problems right like
people like winning they like being part
 
people like winning they like being part
of a company that's winning that makes
 
of a company that's winning that makes
people happy first and foremost um and
 
people happy first and foremost um and
so the business is there there for
 
so the business is there there for
everyone to unite around and to try to
 
everyone to unite around and to try to
solve together and a lot of other stuff
 
solve together and a lot of other stuff
is is frankly a distraction um and I
 
is is frankly a distraction um and I
think that conversation is you know I
 
think that conversation is you know I
guess I've always sort of felt that way
 
guess I've always sort of felt that way
but it's really important these days
 
but it's really important these days
because you know somebody said to me
 
because you know somebody said to me
this week that there's they did math in
 
this week that there's they did math in
pitchbook and there's 1,200 companies
 
pitchbook and there's 1,200 companies
that haven't raised uh and might go out
 
that haven't raised uh and might go out
of business next year if they don't
 
of business next year if they don't
raise um and if that's true then there's
 
raise um and if that's true then there's
going to be a lot of Acquisitions for

for sure but there's also going to be a
lot of folks that can't get Acquired and
 
lot of folks that can't get Acquired and
aren't going to be able to raise and it

I'm curious how that since I was
surprised to see it so interestingly
 
surprised to see it so interestingly
enough CNBC actually reported it first
 
enough CNBC actually reported it first
and I have a relationship with the
 
and I have a relationship with the
reporter and so she pings me probably
 
reporter and so she pings me probably
like once every 3 months to get my
 
like once every 3 months to get my
feedback back on topics as it relates to
 
feedback back on topics as it relates to
people and what's happening in the job
 
people and what's happening in the job
market but I want to take a minute to to
 
market but I want to take a minute to to
run through the facts of what actually
 
run through the facts of what actually
happened because I think you see what's
 
happened because I think you see what's
happening on LinkedIn and then there's
 
happening on LinkedIn and then there's
this whole like from where I stand what
 
this whole like from where I stand what
actually happened so just facts I had an
 
actually happened so just facts I had an
interview with CNBC I told the reporter
 
interview with CNBC I told the reporter
that the open to work feature on
 
that the open to work feature on
LinkedIn is the worst feature ever push
 
LinkedIn is the worst feature ever push
to production for any social media site
 
to production for any social media site
I said that because I think it hurts job
 
I said that because I think it hurts job
Seekers
 
Seekers
and the reason why it hurts job Seekers
 
and the reason why it hurts job Seekers
is because many and I mean literally
 
is because many and I mean literally
dozens of hiring managers and Founders
 
dozens of hiring managers and Founders
have told me that they feel like people
 
have told me that they feel like people
who put that on their LinkedIn are
 
who put that on their LinkedIn are
desperate the reporter didn't get my
 
desperate the reporter didn't get my
quote like exactly right so like I'm not
 
quote like exactly right so like I'm not
going to like get into that but anyways
 
going to like get into that but anyways
they ran the story article goes live and
 
they ran the story article goes live and
many HR pros and recruiters vly
 
many HR pros and recruiters vly
disagreed with me and I think they had
 
disagreed with me and I think they had
like two points of view um one is from
 
like two points of view um one is from
the recruiting standpoint well no it's
 
the recruiting standpoint well no it's
easier to find people that are open to
 
easier to find people that are open to
work if they put the banner on there and
 
work if they put the banner on there and
like LinkedIn prioritizes those people
 
like LinkedIn prioritizes those people
what I would say to that is is that's
 
what I would say to that is is that's
objectively true but recruiters are not
 
objectively true but recruiters are not
decision makers in the hiring process
 
decision makers in the hiring process
and so I'm literally giving a
 
and so I'm literally giving a
perspective from the hiring manager and
 
perspective from the hiring manager and
founder seat the second piece of
 
founder seat the second piece of
feedback is I would summarize it as
 
feedback is I would summarize it as
Nolan is punching down and so the
 
Nolan is punching down and so the
feedback was like it's very harmful that
 
feedback was like it's very harmful that
you're putting this out there it's
 
you're putting this out there it's
misogynistic it's outdated it's super
 
misogynistic it's outdated it's super
biased and my response to that
 
biased and my response to that
is I want people to know what hiring
 
is I want people to know what hiring
decision makers are thinking and I was
 
decision makers are thinking and I was
very direct with what I said but the
 
very direct with what I said but the
intent of what I said was not to be
 
intent of what I said was not to be
biased it's actually to call out the
 
biased it's actually to call out the
bias so people see it and they're aware
 
bias so people see it and they're aware
of it and now people can make a decision
 
of it and now people can make a decision
and that's what I think is actually good
 
and that's what I think is actually good
about what happened so anyways Insider
 
about what happened so anyways Insider
did pick it up they have 11 million
 
did pick it up they have 11 million
followers on LinkedIn and that's when it
 
followers on LinkedIn and that's when it
like went hyper viral and I became the
 
like went hyper viral and I became the
villain on LinkedIn yeah um but any
 
villain on LinkedIn yeah um but any
that's that's the reason why I put out
 
that's that's the reason why I put out
there so people can see it well the
 
there so people can see it well the
thing so I I started seeing a bunch of
 
thing so I I started seeing a bunch of
pings and this and that I was like what
 
pings and this and that I was like what
is going what is doing what is he doing
 
is going what is doing what is he doing
now and I I thought about this a lot the
 
now and I I thought about this a lot the
past few days and talked to some folks I
 
past few days and talked to some folks I
mean the good news is you you had good
 
mean the good news is you you had good
intent like you have good intent right
 
intent like you have good intent right
you're trying to help you're trying to
 
you're trying to help you're trying to
call something out that you've seen so
 
call something out that you've seen so
others can learn from it and we can kind
 
others can learn from it and we can kind
of fix it or they can make a decision
 
of fix it or they can make a decision
that that that was your intent not to
 
that that that was your intent not to
punch down and say this is what this is
 
punch down and say this is what this is
what happens but this is what could
 
what happens but this is what could
happen you should be aware of it and
 
happen you should be aware of it and
make a decision I I think if the feature
 
make a decision I I think if the feature
hurts more than one person it's probably
 
hurts more than one person it's probably
no longer needed and when it first came
 
no longer needed and when it first came
out like let's go back when it came out
 
out like let's go back when it came out
in 2020 during the the pandemic it was
 
in 2020 during the the pandemic it was
necessary like a ton of people had lost
 
necessary like a ton of people had lost
their jobs like overnight and that
 
their jobs like overnight and that
actually was expeditious for recruiters
 
actually was expeditious for recruiters
yeah we're now three years beyond that

fixing bias I was probably one of the
 
fixing bias I was probably one of the
first people at Google to go through the
 
first people at Google to go through the
um the bi the the bias train for
 
um the bi the the bias train for
interviewers y I did this in like
 
interviewers y I did this in like
 
made much progress and it's not for lack
 
made much progress and it's not for lack
of attempt it's because human bias is
 
of attempt it's because human bias is
encoded into our
 
encoded into our
dnas and fixing that is going to take
 
dnas and fixing that is going to take
decades and I am all about doing that
 
decades and I am all about doing that
work there are many people that are
