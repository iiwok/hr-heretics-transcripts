# Molly Graham on Building a Powerful Network, Managing Emotions, + Creating High Performing Teams

## Transcript

 
there's a saying in the tech industry
growth solves all problems I actually
very strongly believe that's true
meaning you can have highly
dysfunctional companies that have a
magical product Market fit and that
dysfunction will get them actually
pretty far one thing we don't talk
enough about is the fact that if your
leaders don't like each other and don't
get
along everything's going to be shitty
inside your company to be honest I've
don't think I've ever had a conversation
with someone where they were like oh I I
ired that person too fast like I should
have slowed down maybe I seek the
impostor syndrome actually I was just
going to ask you how the hell do you
reconcile Bob chewing at your leg the
leg go the impostor syndrome with like
I'm taking jobs that I don't know
anything about your risk appetite is so
high like like no one does this that
seems almost masochistic and I love
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
[Music]
 
hey everyone welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast where we get into the
real talk of company construction these
are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and board members behind closed doors
we're Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially
with people but on the show we tell the
truth and expect the same from our
guests today we're excited to bring you
a conversation with Molly Graham Molly
Graham is a Silicon Valley Legend she
was at Google and then early Facebook
and then the nth employee equip before
they sold for $750 million Molly blew
our minds and I can't wait for you guys
to listen to it it was phenomenal I had
never seen someone so raw with some of
the kind of the most taboo topics when
it comes to founder CEOs Nolan the
depression the isolation the impostor
syndrome and literally unpacking that it
was so good that I was talking to a
Founder this morning and I gave Molly's
advice for how to evaluate exec to him
and said you need to listen to the show
when it comes out tomorrow totally I uh
emailed her right after literally like
we stopped recording and I emailed her
to hang out we got a lot of new stuff
from Molly too she told a story about
shth that had me absolutely dying
laughing I also think Molly gave us more
insight into the way that she thinks and
the way that she comes up with these
amazing metaphors like giving up your
Legos and the monster that's eating at
your leg and where those stories
actually came from yeah I I I actually
love that because everyone reads writes
a ton of Articles there's metaphors
there's all these things we've been
hearing in business for a long time I
had no idea where the Lego Story came
from and it was just it was really cool
to see that oh that's a real person
that's actually a real story that was a
pretty hard thing to work through and it
was just so cool to hear it talk about
that totally Molly is world class she's
on the Mount Rushmore in my opinion of
operators in the valley and I can't wait
for everyone to listen to the show stay
tuned everyone for after this episode
where Nolan and I baned her a bit on the
infamous open to work tab on LinkedIn
where Nolan was credited by Insider late
last week for his opinions on this I
have some opinions some of our opinions
differ some don't can't wait to talk
about it looking forward to it Molly
Graham welcome to HR Heretics how are
you I'm good thanks nice to see you guys
thanks for being on so you have maybe
two of the most like viral first round
articles of all time giving away your
Legos and why you need to make friends
with the monster chewing at your leg can
you give some insights into our audience
as to like what drove these articles and
what made you write them I appreciate
you mentioning the monster article
because most people only talk about the
Legos article and they're they're both
like near and dear to my heart the Legos
article was an accident because um it's
it's a metaphor I came up with when I
was working at Google that was sort of
my first job in Tech a long time ago in
 
time but um my department was 25 people
when I joined I joined in Communications
and um it grew from 25 people to 125
people in N months and so it was my
first experience with with what you
would consider crazy scale you know sort
of um a lot of a lot of Xing and um I
just noticed a pattern when people had
to give things away uh where it created
a lot of insecurity you know you're
somebody new joins you're worried
they're going to be better than you
you're worried you and it causes people
to kind of like hold on tightly to what
they know instead of embracing the
uncertainty and the opportunity that
comes with people taking over what
you've been doing so you can like go do
other things um and then I left Google
and went to Facebook uh again an
accident but um I sort of vividly
remember early on I was in the
Communications Department at Facebook
for like two months and I I had to take
over the blog from someone else we
didn't even have a Facebook page at that
time because Pages didn't exist it was a
Blog and I I was supposed to take it
over and the woman I was taking it over
from was having a lot of trouble giving
it away because she had uh um she had
built it from nothing so it's you know
and anybody that's been inside a scaling
startup knows what that feels like and I
actually talked to her about the Legos
um metaphor at the time where I was just
like look this is this is hard this is
what this feels like but there's can be
a lot of opportunity on the other side
if you if you let go of things um and
and it helped during those Facebook
years I sort of like repeated that
speech to people that worked for me to
myself to friends and then I did a
speech about it uh it was an accidental
speech and I um but I got like a a
really positive response uh the first
round blog was still pretty new so I
forwarded it to Camille and Brett who uh
ran it at the time and they were like
were loved it and I don't think any of
us understood what it would become but I
also think what it is is that people
don't talk about emotions at work all
that much like they don't talk we talk a
lot about how to scale we talk a lot
about um how to manage we talk a lot
about how to lead but we don't talk
about how hard it is and how emotional
it is and how scary it is and the fact
that you know every day you wake up and
you're like you know everyone around me
is better than me and who even gave me
this job in the first place and I really
I always say like I think the Legos
article just says like don't worry it's
all going to be okay and that's why
people like it so much um so I think all
I did was really just like normalize the
emotions with
scaling um and then the monster article
is the same thing maybe just a little
deeper because the monster I don't even
know where he came from but you can tell
that my brain just naturally creates
weird metaphors I was raised on The
Muppets so I think that's why he's a
monster um I always think he's like
animal or something like that you know
but um you know it became my metaphor
for all these emotions that you have uh
when you're going through these complex
experiences building a company um and it
helped me to externalize it um and
that's how I came up with Bob my monster
he's just the external manifestation of
all the emotions I that call them
monster attack so like you're having a
bad day and somebody's being a jerk and
you want to write the rage email like I
always say that's Bob that's my
monster's name is Bob I tell people they
can name their monster whatever they
want um but I it helped me to
externalize it it helped me to like sort
of manifested in a picture and then once
that article came out somebody actually
told me it's a literal tool that
psychologists use to help people manage
anxiety and I was like oh great turns
out it's actually helpful so yeah you at
like the the beginning of the Corning
the impostor syndrome
right like wave I I do have a question
about that cuz that was a while back and
I feel like I feel like it's common now
right people lean into talking about
impostor syndrome and Legos do you think
the industry has shifted a lot with that
CU back when you published those it was
kind of taboo or more taboo I would
argue than now yeah I think probably it
has shifted I think for any number of
reasons we've gotten better at talking
about work and um and feelings I the
thing that really struck me when I was
at quip um and I still think this is
true today is that
nobody it's better now but nobody really
talks about founder depression uh nobody
really talks about that experience of
founding a company and how emotionally
hard it is and we there was a couple
founder suicides around the time that I
was thinking about the monster article
and um you know I felt like we were not
talking enough about the tornado of
feelings that happen as you're building
something and particularly if you're
really early I think that has gotten
better there's a few people out there
really that have embraced talking about
depression and you know all of that but
I would guess I would say it's probably
a topic you can't talk about enough
because to catch somebody before they do
something dramatic like everybody needs
to be talking about it people need to
normalize it and help people understand
that just because they feel like
everything's terrible and they're about
to drive the car off a cliff like
actually that's that's normal that's
what founding a company feels like but
um yeah and also being an early employee
at a company because 100% so you you
were at Google in the tens of thous
 
pre-product walk us through the
differences of going from a scaled
company and then Facebook is still it
was post- product Market fit the company
scaling really fast to then pre-product
we haven't launched you're the ninth
employee what's that like yeah no
totally great point so I I would say
they were all very different and I was
unprepared for any of them Google I
stumbled into which sounds crazy but um
and you know at a company that big you
you identify more with the experience of
your team than you do with the
experience of the company so for me my
experience at Google was defined by that
scaling of the team um which was you
know 25 to 125 employees and then
Facebook again stumbled in there 500
employees uh 80 million users when I
joined and I left at 5,500 employees and
a billion plus users so was wild five
years um that everybody that was there
remembers vividly um and and yeah when I
left Facebook I was unprepared for what
 
um that was what and particularly with
that kind of product Market fit I mean
Facebook was an insane scaling Journey
that very few people get to go on and
I'm super grateful I got to to
experience it but it was literally a
different company every 1 to 3 months
which you know a lot of companies are
not that way um it's it was just such
rapid
scale um and then uh quip like I
literally like thought that I had a
picture in my head when I left Facebook
and I you know took some time off and
did a job search that was very short uh
ended up going to quip and um you know I
knew Brett and I knew one or two of the
other people there and and I thought
startups were just a lot of hard work I
thought that I thought that's what zero
to one was I thought it was like oh like
I get it I know how to work hard like
and I've been on an emotional roller
coaster of scaling and I think I was
absolutely floored in the first six
months by The Emptiness of startups and
the sort of feeling of loneliness and
the feeling of like EV everything we do
might not work and might not be that I
think it was I got run over by a truck
like we launched and I knew exactly what
launches felt like cuz and with you know
know Brett's brand like launching quip
was like everybody wanted to write about
us and everybody wanted to talk about us
and then we got to the other side of the
launch and it was just like nobody cared
you know and when I was hiring employees
into quip I tested them on this because
we hired a couple people from Facebook
and Google and I was like are you cool
working for some place that nobody cares
about you know are you cool selling a
brand that no one's ever heard of and
people aren't going to want to take your
call and people assume that that it's
them but it turns out it's the brand
they're working for and so with quip
like I I was in a dark phase about the 3
months after the launch and I really had
just this feeling of like this car
driving off a cliff or something and and
because I me I like thought it was all
my fault or something because I ran
everything go to market and um and I
went out to uh lunch with a friend of
mine who later ended up working at quip
and uh he had worked in the zero to one
space before which I never had and and I
was explaining to him how I was feeling
which was really hard I hadn't wanted to
talk to anybody about it cuz I just
thought it was like an expression of us
like failing or something like that and
I said to him yeah I just feel like
everything's a mess and like you know no
n's going anywhere and everything's
failing and whatever and he was like
yeah welcome to startups and I was like
and it was like I think it's like what
the Lego's article does for people is is
that moment I was like oh this is normal
I was like oh okay like and it literally
took the weight off my shoulders just
because somebody told me yeah that's how
everybody feels um and I feel like
that's you know again just to go back to
the Legos article like the power is when
somebody says yeah you're you're
supposed to feel this way and you're
like oh okay it gives you that
permission to actually this is actually
normal it's okay we've all gone through
it so different though it's it's so
different though at that stage Molly
like nine people and what's interesting
to me too is like you were in comms and
then you know did a bunch of other stuff
at at Facebook and and then you get to
like running go to market for a
pre-product company you do a launch
Brett's brand like you know get you guys
all over social media I actually
remember that I was an early quii tester
and then unfortunately I was like H like
I'm goingon to go back to Google Docs
like I think a lot of people did you you
you and other people too and then you're
you're what made me depressed noan it's
your fault exactly but then he'll do
that but then there's a gap right
there's like a three four year Gap and
next thing I know it's like quip is
selling to Salesforce for 750 million
doll and from my vantage point it's like
wow like overnight success but what
actually happened there like how did you
guys get that thing going and how did
you guys take on the monster that was
Google Docs quip is a great story um and
uh I think as you said overnight success
so I think that it's important to say
that everything that looks like
overnight success spends a huge amount
of time feeling like a giant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] disaster um and that the people
that are inside of it feel like
everything is terrible all the time the
story of Quip is could be told a bunch
of different ways but um I think the
like Salient thing to what you're uh
talking about is actually the the market
they picked in the first place um and
there's a lot of context around why quip
ended up being sold for as much as it
was um but you know Brett would tell you
that you have to pick a really big
problem like and that's how strategic
Acquisitions happen you have to pick a
problem that's like so big that you're
you're fighting the big guys um and a
lot of people you do see this we see a
lot of startups get started that are
features not products let alone products
that matter when you spend time in the
HR space like a lot of what I spend time
with Founders on is like yo are you one
of the big four because if you're not
your product's going to get cut like Bud
when but push comes to shove and we're
seeing that now with a lot of like the
recruiting products that showed up in 20
 
because budgets got cut and it turns out
all you all you buy is an ATS an hris an
engagement product and a performance
product and that's it you know what I
mean if you're not one of those things
people are going to cut you and this
would be Brett's point right like what
are the four or five major things that
every it manager buys like one of them
is productivity um and we learned that
in every single way so um you know but
fighting against the big guys is hard
right because it turns out that
Microsoft and Google have like a very
very specific selling motion including
they give they give office away for free
right in and yeah they bundle and and um
whenever somebody comes to me and it's
like I'm going to launch a PowerPoint
competitor I'm like let me tell you what
that looks like here's what's going to
happen to your Revenue like you can get
to a certain point and then you will hit
a wall because the big contracts the big
big cont like the truly big ones like it
is hard to win because you know you you
aren't going to get office out you
aren't going to get um Google out and to
some extent in a lot of cases we were
fighting with a free product right which
is what Google is um so I think lots of
lessons learned from that but in terms
of the acquisition itself there was a
rumor going around that Microsoft had
tried to buy Salesforce and then that
acquisition had fallen apart there then
uh LinkedIn was bought by Microsoft and
it was rumored that Salesforce was
trying to by LinkedIn so there was a lot
of competitive Dynamics going on um and
everyone was mad at each other uh and
you know I think Mark benof was really
frustrated with Microsoft and so there
was some Al alliances that he was trying
to build and one of them was with us so
you know a friend once said to me um a
friend who's had his company acquired
three times he said all strategic
Acquisitions start with Partnerships and
that was true for us um and I often tell
Founders that where I'm like hey if you
want to make an acquisition part of your
possible long-term plan you have to
start by thinking who who should I build
a relationship with and who who do I
have like a distribution who am I
complimentary to like where I have an
asset that they want and they have
distribution that I want or whatever um
and that was true of us in Salesforce
like we had already started those
strategic conversations and then they
got even more strategic because there
was like a little Alliance being formed
between Salesforce and other people and
then of course at some point you know
one of the people on the phone said to
Brett I think like hey like why don't we
just buy you guys for like I think he
said $500 million and Brett was like
well that's a very extremely high
opening offer it ended up being a great
thing for Salesforce for sure because
they got bread and and I think it also
let them you know end up buying slack
and kind of actually building a into the
productivity space which it's hard to do
um I don't think Brett ever sets out
building companies to sell them that's
not who he is and I think this was just
a moment of like uh a clear opportunity
um and it was you know obviously
incredibly good for the team and I think
he was really excited to give people
some kind of return for for their time
and their investment awesome story we'll
be right back in a moment after a word

description below ping me on LinkedIn if

something mly you mentioned a few times
about the concept of accidents right
this happened by accident this happened
by accident a lot of listeners including
myself when I started out it's got to be
like this here's the path and especially
Founders as well right here's my path
for the company I'm going to exit in X
years and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens and they become
depressed or you know it's really hard
I'd love to for you to share your
concept on accidents and kind of going
with the flow and if it's changed since
you started no it hasn't changed at all
if anything it's gotten much much deeper
and clearer in the sense of like how I
manage my career which even saying that
sentence I'm like I don't manage my
career I just stumble into things I
wrote an article about this recently
because I think a lot of the advice
you're given in college is terrible uh
really all throughout your childhood you
know people ask you the question what do
you want to do when you grow up and even
that question is a terrible question
because it means you're supposed to know
I don't yeah yeah % neither do I you
know I really am an advocate for not
knowing I majored in African history do
you know what I mean like I spent a huge
amount of time in subsaharan Africa in
college and then I like LED Wilderness
trips all over the world for a couple a
year after college and so I don't think
anybody thought I would end up at Google
or Facebook or any of these places I'm a
Believer in embracing not knowing and
then using your 20s as an exploratory
journey of like learning what I always
talk about is is filling out four lists
what you love doing what you're great at
what you hate doing and what you're bad
at and I'm a big Advocate that those are
four very different lists they have
overlap there is been diagrams um and
then you know designing your career
around the intersection between what you
love doing and what you're great at and
um and that requires experimentation it
requires trying things and being wrong
so like you know going into
Communications that uh Google happened
because I was in a publishing job in New
York um and then and going from Google
to Facebook happened because I followed
people which is definitely one you know
following smart people is one of my
other big pieces of advice so I followed
my boss Elliot shre from Google to
Facebook and then I was in corporate
Communications for two months and
somebody came to me Chris Cox came to me
and said hey I want you to come help me
out in HR and I was like sure and then
he was like I think Mark just asked me
to go run products so you work for this
other woman Lori goer who's still the
head of people at Facebook so she and I
started in the people department on the
same day basically and and grew up
together there cuz she was a marketer
and I was a communicator that was an
accident and it was a lesson in like I
like ended up running the performance
management system at Facebook because
nobody was organizing the project and I
just said to Lori hey can I can I
organize this I'll work with the hrbps
but can I like organize the system and
she was like yeah sure nobody else is
doing it so then I ended up running that
for 2 years I think a lot of it was just
like following my own intuition and like
finding gray spaces finding things that
weren't done obviously at Facebook there
was a lot of opportunity same with
leaving well there was a second chapter
at Facebook where somebody came to me
and said you know he had seen me rewrite
the values with Mark and him at Facebook
and he came to me and said hey do you
want to come build a phone well actually
what he said to me is you're useless you
shouldn't be working in HR like why
don't you go do something actually
useful with your time why don't you come
work for me wow what a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wow well if
you know chath that is basically his
pitch every every time um and he said to
me and he said why don't you come work
for me and I was like doing what and he
said well come work for Javi who's now
the COO of Facebook and run you know
help on International growth or come I
don't know there were two other things
and then he was like or you know I'm
going to build a phone and uh why don't
you come help me do that and I you know
again natural Intuition or whatever I
was like I don't want to do these other
things or I don't think I'd be good at
them you know cuz one of my best friends
worked for jav and I was like she's like
really good and I'm not good at anything
so I was like what is this phone thing
and I you know I was like why are we
doing that we don't like what the actual
F and then you know I spent some time
with him and I talked to Lori and I
talked to a variety of other people all
of whom were like don't do that my dad
Cheryl everyone was like ah it's kind of
a stupid project like it'll be I think
Cheryl literally said it'll be dead in
two months but don't worry you'll always
have a job and I yeah so I ended up I
ended up doing that and it was three
years uh on the mobile team at Facebook
helping really it ended up being helping
figure out the future for Facebook of
mobile and how we wanted to
strategically position ourselves I
really do feel like the only reason I
went to quip was because I worked for
Brett at Facebook these are all happy
accidents and I think the only thing
consistent about me is I just really
don't like doing what I've done before I
get bored really easily it's a huge flaw
everyone always offers you the job you
just had I left quip
and I don't know I think maybe Dylan at
figma was like looking someone was
looking for a COO that I'm sure is now a
massive company I think it might have
been Dylan I don't remember and they
were like why don't you go work for this
person hey do you want to come be a Ser
a COO of a series as SAS startup which
is what I literally just did and I was
like definitely not and the only job
that you know came my way at that time
that Peak my interest was the Chan
Zuckerberg initiative because I was like
this is weird like I don't know how to
do this and you know it's a philanthropy
it's a tech company and they're working
on Criminal Justice Reform and biomed
science like how do I do this and so
maybe I seek the impostor syndrome Kelly
I actually I was just gonna ask you how
the hell do you reconcile Bob chewing at
your leg you know the leg go the
Imposter syndrome with like I'm taking
jobs that I don't know anything about
yeah your risk appetite that seems
almost masochistic and I love it but how
do you reconcile that yeah your risk
appetite is so high like like no one
does this I mean do you run marathons do
you drink whiskey how do you do this so
like first of all there's like how you
get the opportunity in the first place
and you know a lot of that is luck like
it's being good at the job that you were
good at before and then staying in touch
with people that liked you that is that
is how opportunity builds over time you
know um I always say uh life is a barter
economy and that is actually how you
build a really strong Network and what I
mean by that is you do things for people
and then in two years or whatever they
owe you a favor yeah and I was saying to
not that you'd expect it obviously but
no and I but I think that like what you
want with a powerful network is a lot of
people that would do anything for you
and that means to to earn that you have
to do a lot of things for other people
and I feel like somebody was asking me
the other day like there's this concept
these days of like a personal board of
directors and they were asking me like
how I built mine and one of the things I
said to him is like you know to be
honest like I have an amazing I'm so
grateful for all the people that are
willing to like spend time with me when
I'm going through hard decisions or
whatever I have I consider them friends
not a board of directors but um but I
actually think the thing that I've done
that I'm proudest of is I have a very
broad network of people in the world
that would do anything for me because
I've done a lot of stuff for them and
and I don't think of it as like they owe
me I just think of it as like we do
stuff for each other and that that is
how you build a network jobs it's the
same thing like you want people to want
to work with you again so like first of
all don't be a dick when you're at your
company second of all like stay in touch
with people like every time I leave a
company I make a list of people that I
loved working with and I just stay in
touch with them and some of that is just
like we end up doing things for each
other over time and some of it is I get
not these days I get other people jobs
which I like doing I think to your
question Kelly about like Risk tolerance
I definitely have a really high risk
tolerance I don't really think of it
that way because I think of it as
getting bored easily I enjoy learning
curves that are so steep that I'm scared
I'm going to fall off them and when I
have like I've talked about in the past
like I have this concept of legs of a
stool um for work happiness and I think
everybody's legs are different for me my
legs are a mission that I that matters
to me that I want to work on uh people
that I love and and want to see every
day and want to learn from and then the
third is learning and when I say
learning what I mean is a curve so steep
you're gonna fall off I look for that
and that always means that I'm doing
something that I've never done before I
think that nobody talks enough about the
emotions that go with this and to do the
stuff I've done I've definitely gotten
really good and methodical about um
managing my own emotions but it doesn't
mean I don't have them like I was
sitting at czi which is like what 10 or
 
the actual [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hired me to do this job
like this is a70 billion philanthropy
and
I can't do math maybe I like is
everybody cool with that you know and
like I was sitting at this table with um
you know CI was really good for me
because the people that I was working
with were so impressive I mean it was
like biomedical scientists that's won
every award except for a Nobel Prize you
know David Pluff who ran Obama's
campaign Jim Shelton who was in the
Obama White House and has run you know a
bunch of really impressive organizations
and you know I'm the idiot that's
sitting there that's like pausing the
conversation while they're all talking
being like sorry can I just ask a
question like do we have goals I talk a
lot about being a professional [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
that's really what I am like these days
like what's that I I I I just have a
soap boox for a second I could not agree
more with this I've been you know doing
this God forsaken HR role for about 24
years and the thing I always say to
people is the the relationships and the
actual like authentic relationships I
don't think you can fake that like I
don't think you can say I don't want to
help people I don't want want to keep in
touch with people but I'm going to do it
because they're going to help me later
like that just doesn't work I just I I
would go so far as to say is your
mindset around that is probably one of
the biggest reasons you're getting
support for these jobs when you can't
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do math like I do think there's
a psychological Goodwill around that
because people like working with you and
I think that is that is something that a
lot of people do not spend enough time
thinking about and that that compounds
over time I I think um and it's amazing
what can come back to you or not I'm
also a big fan of analogies and it's
like that Force Gump right the leaf half
of it's luck and half of it's just how
how you're moving forward so thank you
for sharing that it's great yeah for
sure and I would say like I I actually
say half of it's luck and half of it's
saying yes when people ask you to do
crazy things which that's the risk thing
you know and I will also just say like
Risk partially comes from being secure
like being able to say yes to crazy
things like you know I've had Financial
Security and I've had people supporting
me like even Cheryl saying like I think
that project will be dead in two months
but you'll still have a job like that's
a kind of security so it's it can be
harder for people to take risks it's one
of the reasons I hate student loans is
because I actually think it causes some
of the more talented people in the world
to make very different decisions coming
out of college because they have to have
income right to cover student loans and
I think it's you know it causes a huge
drag on society and Innovation because
people are so uh married to that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
check they have to write every month so
anyway that's my Soap Box Molly it's the
your take on relationships is awesome
one of my bigger regrets is leaving uh
companies early in my career I told
myself I didn't want to be the person
that was like showing up to company
happy hours and like being like the
senior that just graduated and is now
like always around
and what I've learned throughout my
career is like it's not it doesn't have
to be that way like you can do it with
nuance and you could stay in touch and
care about people and just check in to
see how they're doing and it really
seems like you've mastered that skill
and I think what I've learned from you
so far is like you're amazing with
relationships and metaphors and you're
also just in the arena and you're just
you're you're in the arena just like in
there making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen and like I
think a lot of people are going to learn
from you and learn from this episode on
that note you've worked with amazing
teams uh at Google uh at Facebook at
quip these are all incredible companies
and you were there at you know
especially for Facebook and quip at
inflection points I'm curious about like
what it's like when teams are working
and also when teams aren't working and
how you dissect that and how you go
about getting teams to work well
together yeah well well I'm going to
answer this more from my last set of you
know five or 10 years working with
startups because I spend a lot of time
with Founders bringing me problems and
just saying here's what's going on
inside my company and I will just say
that like there's a saying in the in the
tech industry growth solves all problems
I actually very strongly believe that's
true meaning you can have highly
dysfunctional companies that have a
magical product Market fit and that
dysfunction
uh will'll get them actually pretty far
like it never ceases to amaze me um the
level of dysfunction underneath some of
the you know 10 and 50 billion dollar
more I would say 10 billion dollar
companies it hits you at some point the
dysfunction but the first thing that
matters is your business and if your
business is
sucking uh the dysfunction shows up more
clearly um one of one of my proudest
things is I I've built a couple really
happy high- performing teams in
Dysfunctional businesses and I think
that's hard to do it's actually one of
the hardest tasks because when all your
goals are read or when you know the
number isn't what your investors want it
to be like to have a team that's happy
and loves working together is it's an
extra effort you know when a Founder
comes to me and sort of says here's
what's happening and these people hate
each other usually they come to me and
say we're not hitting our goals and I
think it's the team's fault um a lot of
times what I I spend time first on the
business because the business matters a
ton um and if the business isn't going
well it it reverberates down into the
team and vice versa um the second thing
I spent time on is leadership
I have been thinking about this a lot
recently uh because we spend a lot of
time talking about executive recruiting
and we spend a lot of time talking about
how you hone and find the right person
for your marketing role or your sales
role or your engineering role or your
product role but one thing we don't talk
enough about is
uh the fact that if your leaders don't
like each other and don't get
along everything's going to be shitty
inside your company like if your
engineering leader and your product
leader don't enjoy working together it
is going to be very very hard to
effectively ship code um because those
two people have a bunch of friction and
tension um and it's going to show up in
meetings it's going to show up in
process and it reverberates down into
their team suddenly the product managers
don't like the engineers or whatever um
same on the marketing sales side so you
know I I like one of my hopes and one of
the things I've been talking to more
more and more Founders about uh recently
as they hire their first executive teams
or their second executive teams is not
just hiring individuals but hiring a
team and really thinking through that
team formation both like uh what roles
you actually need and then also the kind
of person I always with jobs I always
say there's the what and then there's
the how right so there's like what are
you hiring for what kind of experience
what kind of background what kind of
skills what kind of seniority and then
there's the how how do you wanted them
to do their work a lot of times we don't
focus on that how and and it it leads to
leadership teams that hate each other
and then it's just like a mess
underneath them and then you're not
hitting your goals and you're like why
am I not hitting your goals and it's
like because your sales leader and your
marketing leader hate each other
especially at early stage companies when
it's usually just about the revenue and
the code and the product I mean it's
true everywhere but absolutely um I
think it it shows up so fast in early
stage companies cuz you know hopefully
you're placing very few leadership bets
like three or whatever you know if
you're early stage and if those folks
don't love working together like it just
makes everything harder and and stuff's
already really hard you know uh there's
nothing harder than fighting for a
product Market fit so how do you think
about assessing for that as part of I
think Executive recruiting is a mess
it's so hard to get right Tony at door
Das used to say the Michael Jordan of EX
recruiting gets it right two out of
three times and so how do you assess for
those skills specifically the relational
skills between cross functional
 
exacts uh Tony and I violently agree my
number is 50% which is I think that I I
actually think I'm a really good
recruiter I learned from uh a woman
named Jamie toat green who's like one of
the best Recruiters in go to market in
the world and she really taught me uh
she did our first executive hires at at
quip and um
and I I'm I think I'm pretty good at at
this point my average is 50% you know
what I mean like it's and I talk about
that a lot to people because I think it
also means you have to be as good at
letting people go at parting ways when
it's not right and doing that
efficiently um as you are at hiring um
and it means hiring is hard and lots of
people aren't good at that and it also
means firing is hard and you got to get
good at that so
um the answer to your question in terms
of how is I think everybody has to find
their own way of assessing the how um
there was this really amazing uh
recruiter who I think was maybe the
first recruiter at Facebook um named
Andy Barton and he taught me a
psychological interview by doing one on
me where he he really I would call it
now I would call it a motivation
interview but a lot of what I do is just
try to understand people deeply who are
you where do you come from you know what
what made you make the decisions you've
made what have you learned like how do
you talk about yourself and your teams
and really why are you why are we even
having this conversation like what what
brought you to my front door what
brought you to this job and like a lot
of it for me is what are you looking for
and does that match what I need inside
the company and then you know in that
process I think of really deeply
assessing people's motivation and um all
that I think you can find out who people
are and whether they fit you know one of
one of the high performing teams that I
built we had this predominant L very low
ego executive team and I remember
looking for um one role I can't remember
what it was I think it was marketing and
I interviewed someone that I was like
this person is very talented like more
talented than anybody else I was talking
to and just came with a backpack full of
ego I I could feel it coming through the
zoom you know what I mean and I was like
yeah this is not going to work like
you're so great and I just could not
hire you cuz you would destroy my team
and I it's not worth it to me because
don't want to make the whole company
dysfunctional in order to have this
level of talent you know so yeah we've
had some hot takes recently on the
tenure for early stage Executives it's
 
what do you think about that I tell
people 18 months like when I'm when I'm
building helping CEOs build leadership
teams like a lot of what I talk about is
like they're like five years from now
and I'm like yeah yeah cute 18 months I
had a conversation once I think it was
with John Carson at stripe and I and and
I was just I just casually said you know
look there's so much churn in early
stage executive teams it's one of the
most painful phases and and really most
leaders don't last more than um than two
years and it's I would say it's the
exception not the rule right the
exception is the leader that lasts
longer than two years um and deserves it
because sometimes CEOs are just wusses
and won't fire the person but um John
said to me uh you know that really
calmed down for us after a thousand
employees and and then I
reflected on it and realized that was
true for Facebook too like Facebook had
a huge amount of turn in the first um
the first thousand employees and then
they built a leadership team Cheryl and
Mark that stayed forever like that it
was the same people for 10 years I think
um and that so anyway I think there's
just a huge amount of turn and somewhat
rightly so if you're growing quickly um
in the sense that like it's just hard
for someone to be as good at sort of the
like 5 million to 20 million to 50
million as they are at 100 million plus
in terms of Revenue and then you know
similarly like if you're not growing
sometimes you're you've got people
hitting the wrong nail with the wrong
tool you know they're using a p Pony
instead of a hammer or whatever so
totally and it makes sense I mean you
said Facebook was a different company
every one to three months like totally
different company I think that's
something I've seen is that people used
to feel bad about that and I think it's
it's not taboo anymore yeah I'm here for
a certain phase it's a tour of Duty and
I'm moving on and that used to be not
not a great gr a grade look even like
five six years ago yeah totally I think
it's uh it's complicated because but the
best execs that I work with that I've
hired that I've worked for whatever hold
on to power very Loosely and are just
like listen I'm here while I'm the right
person to be here I'm here to build the
biggest company I can build and um at
some point if it's not me like that runs
this thing like great I'll find the
right person or I'll build the right
team under me or whatever you know that
is it's very rare for an exec to say
that but when they do that's when it's
magical you had mentioned your hit rate
being 50% and I I tend to agree like
mine's in that neighborhood as well um I
have found that most CEOs and and most
managers in general move too slow to
move people out why do you think that is
and like what can they do to move faster
oh man I just did a talk this week to my
I run a little Community for operators
and I I do a talk uh every other
Thursday and we were just talking about
uh managing up down and sideways I have
this great picture of a very
disappointed turtle that tells people to
fire people um the reason is because
basically no matter how senior of a
manager you are and no matter how many
people you fired you spend a significant
chunk of time thinking that it's you
thinking that it's your fault that that
the person's not performing and that it
and and I feel like that causes you to
be like if only I could just tweak these
things then this person would finally
perform and and the truth is the more
senior you get the longer you've done
this the thing that you start to know is
that as soon as you have that feeling
that something's wrong you need to start
to do the work to figure out what's
wrong um and I and and one of the things
I was talking to that group of people
about yesterday is just like I
um I really believe that hiring has two
parts the first is finding the right
person or what I call making educated
bets on people so you're making an
educated bet on someone the other side
of the bet is how are you going to know
if it was right which means you need to
have that answer before the person
starts in two months and I'm I use a
two-month time Horizon how would you
know if this person is working out as
well as you thought they would better or
worse and I you need to scope all three
um in your mind all you need to do is
sit down and just visualize it okay what
would I feel like in 60 days if this
person was working out as well as I
think they're going to I made a bet that
they're the person I think they are how
and and that can be numbers but not a
there's not you not every number moves
in two months so like this is the hard
thing about sales leaders um but there's
a lot of tangible things like oh I would
feel like the team was they had a handle
on the team and they were firing some
people moving some people out and
figuring out what leadership they needed
to bring in maybe they've brought some
people in already I would feel like I
didn't have to worry about X Y and Z I
would feel like I would see xpq
happening with my leadership team where
they had built relationships with the
following people you can list this is
what it feel you can visualize and then
and then write out and then you can give
it to them you can say hey like here's
what I want to see in 60 days you don't
have to give them the whole list but you
can give them some set of lists and
that's part of setting expectations for
someone when they start this is what
success looks like this is what I what
matters to me and then ask them to bring
you a plan hey what are you going to do
in the first 30 60 90 days whatever but
like I think often we stop at hiring
we're like Victory like I found the
perfect person all done and um then
somehow we're surprised when half the
people struggle at two months or three
months or whatever and so it takes us
six or nine months to get rid of someone
and by that time you've lost a lot of
momentum you they've they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the
team they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the business I think
planning for the 50% matters to your
point figuring that out early right
because if someone's N9 months in and
they're kind of struggling replacing
that person's very stressful and
sometimes it can put the business back
at least 12 months and so you want to
hang on to that person like try try like
held and make it work yeah and I think I
think there's value in in second
guessing yourself you know but to be
honest I've don't think I've ever had a
conversation with someone where they
were like oh I I fired that person too
fast like should have slowed down like
I've just never had that conversation
it's always like man should have done
that n months ago I think that that is
partially just because it takes us a
long time to to sort out what's really
going wrong and and to some extent to
stop blaming ourselves or trying to fix
ourselves as managers Molly how do you
counsil Founders leaders HR leaders to
fire
Executives what's the textbook way that
should work I don't think it's that
different for executives in for in place
because at the end of the day if you're
good manager the person the person often
fires thems you know the person is like
yeah this isn't working I'm not happy or
I'm not performing because you've been
having conversations with them for two
months or a month or whatever that like
hey here's what I'm seeing and this is
what's frustrating me and this isn't
working and you know here's another
example and you know what management is
at the end of the day is like laying a
foundation for a conversation with
someone around like what you expect of
them and then having a conversation over
time about how they're doing relative to
those expectations and if you're not
having that conversation then you end up
having either a a very long process of
firing somebody B surprising them like
they think they're doing well and you
think they're not um or see it just
takes for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever you know
because then totally so I you know I
think for me uh I a put a lot of
emphasis on that conversation and making
sure that it's obviously a expect like
that expectations are clear and then
that I'm having a conversation with
someone about those expectations but I
think then with with truly senior
leaders um unless there's weird
intentions underneath a lot of times it
can be a very mutual decision um someone
sometimes has to be the one you know
sometimes you have to be the one that
says look this just isn't working out
and I don't think we're going to fix it
in the time that I need you know like
maybe we could fix it if we had six
months but we don't um and sometimes you
have to be the one that says so I want a
our ways um but if you've done your job
well as a manager usually they're like
okay I understand and I might be mad and
you might have to pay me some money but
I get it because we've been having this
conversation for a while Molly that's so
good I love your framework of setting
the expectation for yourself before you
hire somebody and two months from now
how will I how will I measure if I'm
feeling if this is good or not good or
if it's working or not um I love that
I'm going to start making everybody do
that before they make hires I do it at
the beginning where you're scoping the
role and then at the end once you've
hired the person and I love the quality
of that aspect of that totally like what
does what does it feel like what's going
on on what's the vibe of this person
after two months that is just as
important to your point about the what
and the how totally we that's it's such
a good point Kelly like at Google we
tried to do all this stuff to remove
bias and I I think one of the things we
swung so hard to kind of just be robots
and I actually think like especially
with executive level hiring like you
have to lean into
feelings yeah if they don't win the
hearts and minds of the people that are
executing you're you're screwed I have
one more quick one for you Molly what is
the biggest misconception are you seeing
Founders having around HR leader roles
Chief people officers what are you
telling them
interesting can I rephrase the question
it's interesting the I'll just tell you
what I want to what I the question I
want to answer which is like what am I
seeing Founders want and ask for that
maybe isn't as common in the HR space
every founder I talk to right now wants
an operational head of people meaning
they want a head of people that thinks
about the business
and understands the business and
understands that at the end of the day
they're not responsible for employee
happiness they're responsible for one of
the largest budget budget items inside
the company um they're responsible for
unit economics because at the end of the
day like most companies most software
companies the two biggest expenses are
people and servers um you know obviously
if you have like a retail business
there's other costs but if people are
the biggest expense inside of a company
how do you as a people leader think
about running that at the process of
filling those seats well um and being
economically and fiscally responsible to
the business and the business that needs
to be built um I think sometimes
we uh have focused so much on happiness
that we forgotten that everybody's going
to be unhappy if there's no business and
uh I see Founders pretty desperate for
partnership that understands that at the
end of the day this is a business and if
the business doesn't work which there's
a lot of these days um no one has a job
so I think that like for me if I were
like gift something to the the sort of
people leaders of the world it would be
an understanding that everything has to
be business first um that doesn't mean
you people can't be happy I actually
think people like winning number one
grow solves all problems right like
people like winning they like being part
of a company that's winning that makes
people happy first and foremost um and
so the business is there there for
everyone to unite around and to try to
solve together and a lot of other stuff
is is frankly a distraction um and I
think that conversation is you know I
guess I've always sort of felt that way
but it's really important these days
because you know somebody said to me
this week that there's they did math in
pitchbook and there's 1,200 companies
that haven't raised uh and might go out
of business next year if they don't
raise um and if that's true then there's
going to be a lot of Acquisitions for
for sure but there's also going to be a
lot of folks that can't get Acquired and
aren't going to be able to raise and it
just means that the business of how
people show up and how they help build
companies and how they help companies
achieve their goals is is more important
um but it is at the end of the day a
part of a business the goal is to make
the business Thrive could not agree more
and the era of luxurious beliefs is
over yeah I mean I would just say the
era of excess is over but yeah for sure
turns out turns out unit economics
matter who knew we're back we're going
to go through our rapid fire questions
um and so I'm I'm actually really
curious about this one for you because
you've hired so many great people who's
your best hire and
why best higher come on one so many no I
can't do it humble br oh there's so many
one person no no it's not me it's them
I'm I like have gotten to work with so
many incredible people in my life and I
it would be like I don't even know
picking a favorite kid they're all my
favorite I love them okay so then you it
is true you have worked with amazing
people on your team um tell us about the
best interview question to get signal on
them I I think I have an interview style
that works for me and I don't
necessarily recommend it to other people
the thing I recommend to other people is
find your interview style and the one
that works for you what I start with is
tell me your story and I I really love
stopping at the word story and and then
people start in really fun places you
know I remember when I interviewed the
guy who was the head of comp at Facebook
for a long time uh he said well I was
born in Romania and and then told me his
whole life story and and you know he had
a refugee back anyway it was it was
awesome and I I felt like I knew him by
the end and you know I I love where
people start when you say tell me your
story and then I love where they go and
it helps me but that's because I'm me
and it's because I listen in a certain
way and I probe in a certain way ask
questions in a certain way I love that
Molly Graham this is amazing thank you
so much for your time so good thank you
Molly yeah thanks you guys so fun so
Nolan how did Business Insider get to
you on the open to work yeah on LinkedIn
I'm curious how that since I was
surprised to see it so interestingly
enough CNBC actually reported it first
and I have a relationship with the
reporter and so she pings me probably
like once every 3 months to get my
feedback back on topics as it relates to
people and what's happening in the job
market but I want to take a minute to to
run through the facts of what actually
happened because I think you see what's
happening on LinkedIn and then there's
this whole like from where I stand what
actually happened so just facts I had an
interview with CNBC I told the reporter
that the open to work feature on
LinkedIn is the worst feature ever push
to production for any social media site
I said that because I think it hurts job
Seekers
and the reason why it hurts job Seekers
is because many and I mean literally
dozens of hiring managers and Founders
have told me that they feel like people
who put that on their LinkedIn are
desperate the reporter didn't get my
quote like exactly right so like I'm not
going to like get into that but anyways
they ran the story article goes live and
many HR pros and recruiters vly
disagreed with me and I think they had
like two points of view um one is from
the recruiting standpoint well no it's
easier to find people that are open to
work if they put the banner on there and
like LinkedIn prioritizes those people
what I would say to that is is that's
objectively true but recruiters are not
decision makers in the hiring process
and so I'm literally giving a
perspective from the hiring manager and
founder seat the second piece of
feedback is I would summarize it as
Nolan is punching down and so the
feedback was like it's very harmful that
you're putting this out there it's
misogynistic it's outdated it's super
biased and my response to that
is I want people to know what hiring
decision makers are thinking and I was
very direct with what I said but the
intent of what I said was not to be
biased it's actually to call out the
bias so people see it and they're aware
of it and now people can make a decision
and that's what I think is actually good
about what happened so anyways Insider
did pick it up they have 11 million
followers on LinkedIn and that's when it
like went hyper viral and I became the
villain on LinkedIn yeah um but any
that's that's the reason why I put out
there so people can see it well the
thing so I I started seeing a bunch of
pings and this and that I was like what
is going what is doing what is he doing
now and I I thought about this a lot the
past few days and talked to some folks I
mean the good news is you you had good
intent like you have good intent right
you're trying to help you're trying to
call something out that you've seen so
others can learn from it and we can kind
of fix it or they can make a decision
that that that was your intent not to
punch down and say this is what this is
what happens but this is what could
happen you should be aware of it and
make a decision I I think if the feature
hurts more than one person it's probably
no longer needed and when it first came
out like let's go back when it came out
in 2020 during the the pandemic it was
necessary like a ton of people had lost
their jobs like overnight and that
actually was expeditious for recruiters
yeah we're now three years beyond that
and so how how the open to work Banner
uh how a hiring manager reviews that
Banner is now different three years in
the the other thing I'll say is like on
fixing bias I was probably one of the
first people at Google to go through the
um the bi the the bias train for
interviewers y I did this in like
 
made much progress and it's not for lack
of attempt it's because human bias is
encoded into our
dnas and fixing that is going to take
decades and I am all about doing that
work there are many people that are
doing that work we should keep going but
if people are getting hurt today not
saying something is worse wor than
knowing it and keeping it to myself yeah
look I applaud you for saying it I think
there's a lot of folks out there on all
different parts right of this of this
side and they're bringing their own
experiences to the table when they're
reading it or agreeing or disagreeing so
I'm always going to I'm always going to
like kind of go at you with the it's not
a one- siiz fits-all dude it it never it
never never is now I will tell you I
disagree on it's 3 years later like
being in HR and seeing Informatica just
laid off 10% of their Workforce like two
days ago totally or whatever it was so
that is not over and the alism and the
community like help that I've seen on
LinkedIn with everyone trying to help
each other and is still going on is is
like nothing I've ever seen like I
haven't seen that on LinkedIn in my how
long is LinkedIn but like I've been
doing this 23 years and the level of
like wildfire community help and support
for people that have been losing their
jobs especially over the last 12 18
months yeah it's very big so I think
honestly noan you're you're getting a
lot of blowback on that because your
comments were seen as insensitive yep to
those that got screwed over by all this
nonsense totally and the audience can
disagree with me I think if you would
have posted that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 3 years ago or
four years ago you wouldn't have heard
anything uh you think so I I think that
people would not be as heightened to it
because the market was much different
and I I do I think well the banner only
came out during the pandemic well just I
know but I'm just saying what if it was
there five years ago I don't think you
would have gotten a lot of blowback
because people literally yeah are not in
the same it's the moment you're saying
it's the moment and I think the
environment has a lot to do with it and
I think and I've helped a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of
people in LinkedIn that lost their jobs
and I think people are speaking up for
other people now I will tell you and
people might disagree with
me as an
executive I wouldn't put that on there
why
not I well so first of all I don't
really think about it right so you
mentioned this and I agree with it
networking working your networks Making
Connections talking to people cold out
bounding hiring manag I just
that's what all I would think of I
probably wouldn't even think of changing
my yep I I didn't even know the feature
freaking existed to be honest like until
recently like so there there's that
piece of it but that being said like the
industry people are in the job function
people are in the levels of these of
these roles and like whether you're
full-time or temporary a consultant like
these are all factors that like come on
we're all reasonable this can't be a
black or white issue it depends for
hiring managers especially for early
stage startups they are biased what I am
saying is is people should be aware of
that and that there is a conversation
happening that they don't know about and
now I'm telling and look in parallel I
think there's a lot of things as a like
I got a lot of feedback on like well
Nolan you should be helping people
that's my intent you're trying and I
actually totally agree that school does
not prepare people to go find job like
the number one question I get from
college kids is how should I get a job
how do I get my foot in the and so I
actually have talked a lot about this
historically but I think like it's a
problem with our educational system is
we don't teach people applicable skills
that they're going to use to make a
living the other thing I just noticed
from this conversation is there is a
monoculture of thought in HR and I I
came in from a different angle on this
and I piss that monoculture off and
that's one of the reasons why we started
this podcast is because we wanted to we
wanted to have more of a discussion and
to to illuminate that there's other
points of view to get things done and as
I told people on LinkedIn look I'm
optimizing for Speed here I could have
chosen my words better it could have
been quoted better but I'm optimizing
for Speed and letting people know and
trying to help them yeah but look the
the bottom line for me is it's a data
point like your opinion on this like
whether you disagree or agree any
reasonable person would agree that
shit's out there so you should be you
should be aware of it take it or leave
it but exactly that that it it is it is
real in some respect and that that's my
biggest takeaway is it should be in in
the consideration set then um you know
it's funny like you said
recruiters see this but the higher
maners make the
decision again I could get chastised for
this but if I if I like pulled every
recruiter at pendo I bet you a lot of
them would be like I don't even really
mention that to the hiring manager but
the hiring manager's looking on LinkedIn
Kelly like every man I've never had a i'
I've never in the three years this damn
features been out I've never had a hire
manager say oh the circle's green like
forget it I and I've never even noticed
my myself when I've been hiring people I
literally like yeah it again it's like
whether you're looking or not I want
that person because they're the best
person for this job yeah and that is
that is the way the world should work
all the time my comments were to State
the way the way the world works is not
like that all the time I'm just telling
you in my career boots on the ground
scaling these damn companies I've never
how to hire a manager say the circle's
Green Forget it okay I'm going to
introduce you to some of the people that
I know I want I mean right The Point
again I don't care the point is not to
not to shun disagree or agree the point
is to understand everything that's out
there that's how you educate people and
that's what you're trying to do yep I I
appreciate the discussion I appreciate
you still befriending me um and I want
to hear from the audience too like am I
full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yep and I do appreciate
everyone's discussion and comments I
