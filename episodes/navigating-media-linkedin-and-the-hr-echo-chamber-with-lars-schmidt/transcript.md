all right everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today we
have Lars Schmidt on and Lars you are
kind of the OG of people
ophr content creation so where I want to
start is I want to know like how this
thing got started and how did you think
about like becoming an online content
creator ah you know OG like that's just
like play for for old but uh I'll I'll
uh I'll take that yeah I mean look I for
me it's like it goes back to probably
around
 
for
NPR uh I just came over there from
running Global Talent Ticket Master so U
pretty big shift very small team uh lots
of you know Whiplash in terms of like
team and res sources going from like a
global for-profit to a
nonprofit um and so around that time you
know i' had been working in the field
for you know about a dozen years um and
I wanted to start writing like that was
kind of my entry point like you know
blogging was a thing Twitter was a thing
this is like you know 2010 right so like
back back in the early days of social
media post friender but still old and uh
and yeah so I there's uh I Look to a lot
of people in the HR space who I admired
their writing style people like laor
Rudman uh Matt Charney Charlie Judy
people that were just really strong
writers um and I wanted to you know I
don't want to emulate them because you
can't really emulate other people's
Styles but I wanted to start writing
more and so for me it just started with
like reps and I'm not an actual writer
you know I'm not like a prolific like
there's some people who crank out like
you know newsletters every day that's
not me I've tried that before it sucks
like I suck at that like I have to
really have something to say
um and so I started thinking about like
what do I want to what do I want to
write what can I write about and you
know this was kind of where my interest
in like writing an open source and
social media converged because at NPR
like we went all in on employer branding
strategy this is like the early days of
digital employer branding so we created
one of the first employer brand Hashtags
with NPR life which you know now is kind
of common place then it was a bit of a
revolutionary thing um and so a lot of
my early writing was just like what we
were trying what we were experimenting
with uh what we were learning from that
where we were failing and uh and I found
that there was a lot of curiosity
obviously about a place like NPR so
being able to have the freedom to write
about that in a place that people were
curious about um I think gave me a bit
of a a running start on building like a
platform in an audience and that was
kind of how I got my start and the
writing led to speaking you know and it
kind of all built from that but that was
really the seeds of it is I I was really
just inspired by some really amazing
writers in the space and wanted to kind
of follow their lead and and establish
my invoice when did you get to this
point of going actually solo and and
going off on your own yeah so it was
 
was brought in as a transformation like
a turnaround person in PR so uh we were
making the shift from radio and
broadcast to digital uh we brought in
new chro to lead that he hired me to
lead the talent side of that so um once
you know that was like a three-year
project at the end of three years it
shifted to maintenance maintenance is
not where I shine so I was like H it's
time to kind of do something else and
I'm like well what am I going to do like
what do I really want to do next I had
an offer to run Global recruiting for
SoundCloud in Berlin and we almost took
that but you know my wife and I were
trying to start a family at the time and
we're like you know we're really going
to move to Berlin and like be so far
away from friends and family and like
our support networks and decided not to
do that and so um my boss at the time
had just gotten recruited by Elon to run
HR at SpaceX and wanted me to move out
there to run talent for him at SpaceX um
but we' already lived in La twice and uh
you know wanted to kind of grow roots in
the DC area where we are now and so I
said you know I can't move out there and
like help you build this team but I'm
thinking about starting my own firm and
I can come out and do that and do that
basically as an advisor to help you
build your team and do all the things
that I would do if I was in house but
just do it through a third party and so
that's kind of how I leapt across I
wasn't one of of those people that was
always like oh I can't wait of having my
own company and I you know grew up with
the entrepreneural desires like the
opposite was true I was like that's
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't want to do that like I
want to do ninet to-5 I want to have a
steady paycheck I want stability and
then something called blackberries
happened and and social media happened
and I was like you know what like I'm
never gonna have a job in the work that
I do that it challenges me that's it's
going to be a 9 to5 Monday through
Friday job so if I'm not going to have
that then why not not try to go out on
my own and see what I could build yeah I
just watched that movie by the way the
one about the Blackberry the rise and
fall the Blackberry oh great flick great
flick I had a holster I was a holster
guy I couldn't be it now I had a holster
yeah you had a holster oh my God it was
a thing it was a whole thing yeah part
of the uniform it was incredible I still
think it's easier to type on those than
the I than the the iPhone but oh yeah
keyboards yeah for sure so that's kind
of one of my questions Lars is you look
at your LinkedIn and you've built like
this Empire and I don't say that in like
a weird way or like it's speaking it's
teaching it's your company it's writing
Forbes I mean it's it's very
intimidating sounds like that wasn't
really planned if you looked at it I'm
like this guy architected all of this
and I can't do that like what would you
say to folks who were like I kind of am
interested in this stuff and don't
really know where to start or don't have
a lot of confidence in it how how did
that all snowball yeah I mean look I I
can see here I can tell you that uh that
this is all part of a master plan that
I've had around building this like
ecosystem of media and talent and I'd be
full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I tend to think about my
own career in like one to two year at
most increments I never look Beyond two
years and in doing so it allows me to
kind of explore my interests and my
passions as I'm discovering them and so
you know if you would have asked me like
literally if you would have asked me at
any point in my career over the last
decade two years prior to that moment
hey do you see yourself doing this I
would have said no so there is a certain
freedom and kind of serendipity that
comes with not being tied to outcomes
and being tied more to like curiosity
and I think for me like I've always been
not afraid of failure like I'm I'm happy
to experiment with things I'm happy to
try things I'm happy to Pilot things and
if they work lean into that and if they
don't don't and I think you know you
look back at podcasting right like so I
I started writing I I'll I'll Journey
back in a minute and then I'll come back
to your question so um once I started
writing I was originally writing for you
know like HR press so like you know some
writing for Sherm and some writing for
like LinkedIn talent and other you know
trade press and and I was like you know
yes it's good to write for these places
but if my main driver is like driving
change and having impact I need to take
the conversations that we're having in
HR out of HR and bring them to like the
sea Suite bring them to investors and
bring those to people that are in a
position to actually allow us to do this
work uh not just like this whole insular
kind of bubble of HR talk within HR and
so that's when I started writing for
Forbes um I got an introduction from
George Anders uh who was a contributor
I'd met him through Talent connect and
you know we we' done a few things
together and so he made an introduction
um but Fast Company was always like The
Bucket List place for me that's where I
dreamed of writing that's where I always
wanted to have a by line that's what I
aspired to and so I you know wrote for
Forbes for a few years I kind of used
that as like a training ground to
tighten my writing and get better at
that to then be in a position where I
was comfortable approaching fast company
and so I found uh uh I got introduced
through a friend who is a contributor
there and I they introduced me to their
editor uh generously because it's very
hard to get in there so I had a leg up
and that was you know a privilege that I
had uh and so I I said hey can I I I'm
very interested in writing for Fast
Company like Can I submit you a piece
and they were like yes you can submit a
piece uh we will decide whether we want
to run it or not uh you do not have any
editing rights it was like like feel
like you know this over it we'll see
what we can do so I wrote a piece
rejected now this doesn't fit okay can I
send you another piece yes you can send
another piece same rules apply sent
another police piece rejected can I send
you another piece and if I'm annoying
tell me because I don't want to piss you
off because obviously I still aspire to
write there and I don't want to like
burn in your Bridges before I even have
them but is that okay yes rejected so on
my fifth piece fortunately he didn't
give up on me he let me keep trying it
took this is incredible this is like
when Rudy was trying to apply to Notre
Dame and right like I was like I was JB
scrub I was walk on I was like yeah but
I but it's what I really wanted it like
this was something I really wanted like
there's no place that I was more
interested in writing because I just I
always been the big reader of Fast
Company I admire the way that they kind
of shape tastes and I think that
influence the industry and so I'm just
like again I kind of come back to First
principles if my goal is driving
influence and impact to Build a Better
World of work by elevating the field of
HR a place like bass company is where I
need to be sharing my ideas and so on
the fifth attempt uh I got accepted and
then I you know I learned I took all the
notes that he gave me uh on the forward
that he rejected and what he liked about
the fifth one I tried you know learning
from that incorporating that in the next
one and you know then I of got on the
streak where where we you know he began
to say okay well you have a point of
view that I think does uh matter and you
know your writing is fair but like I can
work with it and uh he helped me become
a better writer like the first editor I
had and after I think of like five or
seven pieces then I had my own by line
um in Fast Company and then ended up
having uh a new editor that I worked
with and have worked with since so um
but really like the the reason I say
that I give that story is like you know
yes it can be intimidating to
start and but nothing happens overnight
like I was rejected a ton um before I
started you know building this up when I
started my first podcast I had no idea
what I was doing uh and it sucked and
like it got better with time but it was
it's really just reps and so if you're
out there and you're on the fence and
you're like how do I approach this the
best way to start is just to start and
don't even think about necessarily
having an audience in mind or an outcome
in mind just start to get your thoughts
out whether it's uh writing you know
which I think is a great way to get
started whether it's like writing you
know writing could be like posts longer
form posts on LinkedIn right I know a
lot of people who are great writers who
don't write books and don't write blog
posts they just write on LinkedIn and
they're sharp and they're quick witted
and their their writing is really
valuable so it's like find where you're
comfortable lean into that um but just
be like try not to be tied to the
outcomes of what will happen just kind
of work on the craft and over time with
the Reps that craft will get better that
better craft will open more doors for
you when I was growing up but I was like
 
all these amazing careers on LinkedIn
and these high-powered people with these
these track records or someone like you
that are is doing all these things and
you get intimidated and it's just that
story is so helpful to to know that we
all have had so many hard times in doing
this like scratching and clawing and we
don't know what we're doing half the
time and you're trying and you're faking
it till we make it which is a term you
know thrown around but that's that stuff
is real um and that we're all really
human and we start somewhere because I
used to think like these VPS and these
big officers were like inhuman like gods
and and and they're not and I just put
it out there because I you know I used
to think like that so yeah I mean you're
right Kelly going from zero to where
you're just starting to bars feels like
you know you're climbing Mount Everest
and in I think totally what I love about
that story is it reminds me of the the
feedback Mr Beast gives to people who
ask him for video edits yeah and his
feedback is go make a 100
videos and it serves as this like
amazing uh filter because one you know
no one actually like goes and makes 100
maybe 1% of the people that do that ask
for feedback actually do it and then two
the people that go and make 100 videos
are learning along the way and they no
longer need the feed back and that's
that's what you did LS right you just
kept putting content out into the world
you got feedback on that content you
iterated on it and you made it better
over time and then with good content
came your audience yeah I mean look
that's the thing I think when you're
when you're a Creator you're by
definition you're building things to put
out into the world and you can see how
people respond to that so you can see
which things resonate um and which
things don't and like some of that is
metrics more of that is anecdotal like
I'm not really metrics person as it
relates to that like I'll have a
Whimsical post off the cuff that'll get
a ton of Engagement and something that
put a ton of thought into that gets like
no engagement I'm like wait a minute
that's you know part of it is you're at
the mercy of the algorithms right you
never really know how that's going to
work but like but you don't you don't do
it for that purpose you just do it
because like I have something that I
want to say and this is important for me
to to put out there and again like I
also say that this is just my own
approach other people have different
approaches so mine isn't right or wrong
there are some people that are like like
swear by force yourself to write
something every single day and that's
how you get the Reps and that's great
that's just not me right so I think also
like I I'll I'll be cautionary to not
like prescribe a
methodology around like what will work
for you anybody listening it's more of
just like this is what worked for me and
you kind of have to find what worked for
you but you'll do that I think by
listening to a lot of other people
who've created in a lot of different
ways and then take pieces from each of
them and kind of bu your own process hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after a word from our sponsors Real Talk
most Talent leaders haven't yet cracked
how to leverage AI for Meaningful impact
on their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting teams efficiency and quality
use metaview metaview is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
candidates during calls and save time on
the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline hiring teams
can make confident informed decisions
and talent leaders can finally take
control of the interview process join
Forward Thinking Talent leaders at high
performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and pora and out medavie head
over to metav vi. a/ Heretics to talk to
one of metav VI's product experts or get

minutes here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive
excessive ible and mobile First Tool
people actually like using it which is
why companies like Ryan a Dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shout outs and live streams among
other features help Elevate the employee

we sit at a desk or drive a truck make
work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human

a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from AGR Heretics
 
say I do want to ask you about the
downsides of being very online in a
second but just for people to have a
little bit more context you have almost
 
looks like you're actually in a
partnership with LinkedIn producing
podcasts for them how did that LinkedIn
podcast partnership come to be so I mean
I've been doing work with
LinkedIn like in range of capacities
since like 2010 probably I think when I
first spoke at Talent connect like way
back in the day um and so I had done
some editorial work with them and like
quote unquote influencer work with them
which you know makes me gag when I say
that referring to myself which I never
do actually by the way like anybody
who's calling themselves an influencer I
kind of have an issue with that I you'll
never hear me refer to myself that way
but I've been involved in some of their
programs that that do that and they had
a uh um they were trying to expand their
LinkedIn podcast network uh and so last
year um redefining work was one of about
 
accelerator program which is like a
six-month accelerated program that um
gave you exposure to their editorial
team their podcast team some of their
other hosts to learn more about like how
they use LinkedIn tools like LinkedIn
newsletter and Linkedin live um and um
that was a great you know experience
where I learned a lot and at the end of
that they invited um me to join to
officially join the LinkedIn podcast
Network so redefining work became a part
of the LinkedIn podcast Network so
that's kind of how I how I ended up
getting in there so cool it's just it's
a another lesson which is just the the
longer you're in the game the bigger
your surface area of luck becomes and
you just need to stay in the game so
you've been online for a long time what
are the downsides of being so online um
I mean yeah there certainly are
downsides to it like I think having
healthy boundaries between you know IRL
and social media uh can be a struggle
you know this has been something I've
grapple with for years like uh having
those healthy boundaries where I'm kind
of like put your phone away like I don't
need to be online right now like I don't
need to be looking at this and that is
is like a the general draw of social
media as a consumer not just a Creator
and so I think that the convergence of
being both a consumer and a Creator
magnify that so that's certainly one um
I think the second is you know when
you're a Creator and you have a presence
on social media and also depends on how
you show up like for me I try to show up
very authentically Who I Am with my
opinions with my shortcomings um with my
biases with My Views I try not to filter
much of anything I'm not saying that's
the playbook for a lot of people it's
not it's just for me personally that's
how I'm comfortable with and that means
that you know by opening myself up in
the ways that I do I will open myself up
to encouragement but also criticism
right I won't share views that people
think that I should share um sometimes
and I may take heat for that and I think
that that is just part of being online
is being part of being a Creator and
like you know do I love it h no but it's
like I realize that it comes with the
territory and I try to take it with a a
grain of salt the best advice that I got
actually five years ago is when I was I
was first creating my first CPO
Community which was the kind of the
original version of what is now the
Amplified Talent community and I was
drafting an email that I was going to
use to invite cpos from my network to
join and I sent it to a friend and I
sent to a few friends I'm just like hey
what do you think about this uh and just
I remember this very vividly like one of
my friends came back to me and said that
email sounds awesome that's a really
good email that is not you and I picked
up the phone I'm like I called
immediately I'm like can we talk about
that like can you tell me more about
what you mean he's like you know look I
know you pretty well and I know that you
know you have this distinct style and
like authenticity and just vibe that I
know you because I know you personally
like that email sounds great but it's
like a very corporate stiff sounding you
say all the right things but it's just
not you and like people are going to be
drawn to this community because they're
drawn to you not this kind of corporate
version of you and it was just it was so
profound in that moment because I think
that was right around the time I was
leading more into like podcasting and
writing and and all the things that
became kind of a lot of the media stuff
that I was building that was like an
unlock for me because I I probably
needed to hear that at the time and I
think from that moment on I was like you
know what you're right like I'm just
gonna I'm just going to be me and like
that will attract the people who I want
to attract and it'll repel the people
that aren't down with like that and both
of those outcomes are good I mean it's
just like employer branding right great
employer branding attracts and repels
and I'm just like hey I'm more
comfortable just being in my own skin in
that way and if it um you know repels
some people then then so be it well I
think I'd speak for Nolan and I when we
both say preaching to the choir there uh
we we agree you know Lars this this
media there's so many different things
you've been doing and and doing and and
right podcasting is really big now and
it wasn't before and I'm just curious
you know better than I would where is
all this going like what's the next
chapter of media and all these things
that you're dabbling in now are you
thinking about that at all if so kind of
what what are the trends that you're
seeing if we fast forward 10 years from
now yeah oh God 10 don't ask me about 10
years now I know three three years is
theing our AI robots to uh you know do
little writing for us you know it's
funny like Mars robot
I actually I had a a guy Kawasaki on the
podcast uh a week ago and he talked
about how he took like all of the
writing that he has done which he's been
prolific for decades and like programmed
it into a custom llm to create Kawasaki
GPT and he runs things by that as a
starting point which is fascinating but
that's that's so that's probably the
future which is actually here now uh I
think for me I mean it's interesting
like uh again I'm not a prolific writer
I don't consider myself to be a great
writer like I'm a decent writer but I
have to really have something I want to
say um I'm a decent
podcaster uh I'm a decent Storyteller
like there's any I wouldn't say there's
any one thing that I'm like I'm amazing
at X and that's not false humility I
think it's just like I'm I put in the
rep so I'm pretty good at a range of
different mediums and that's my
superpower is like being pretty good at
a at multiple things as opposed to like
being amazing at one thing I think in
this age of AI now it as a Creator it's
going to be interesting I mean you know
probably especially on LinkedIn I mean
at least half the stuff for reading it
was you know at least not if not totally
written by AI uh you know initially
framework by Ai and as we see uh you
know open Ai and tools creating more of
these video platforms you can create and
you saw I mean you know when we're
recording this like a week ago Reed
Hoffman interviewed an AI replica of
himself for his podcast right like that
technology is there and it's going to be
advancing so fast that I think even in
three years from
now I it's going to be I mean there's
going to be so much AI generated content
like the ability to to sift Kind real
from fake is going to be nearly
impossible and so I think what it comes
down to will be like the the role of a
Creator will be around both creation
using these tools but also curation
right um I looked at someone like a hung
Lee with recruiting brain food like he
has such an amazing ability to curate
interesting content and bring them
together in interesting ways that um
it's easier to trust those trusted
curators to help you surface the great
content that necessarily me as an
individual going out and you know me you
know I this is part of what I do as well
so like I probably have an advant but
like for the average person to go out
and be like hey I want to learn about X
where can I find that it's like you find
the person who's really known for doing
a good job of both creating and curating
an X and you follow that person so right
um right it's going to get wild I don't
know even even three years out I can't I
can't predict that with accuracy I think
that original voices will matter I think
great writers who have their own
distinct style will stand out in the sea
of AI generated content um they just
will because AI can't write like them um
but that's going to be fewer and further
between I think podcasting also becomes
an interesting platform because again
it's like what we're doing now you're
seeing people you're seeing them react
in real time you're seeing different uh
conversations obviously with this you
can take this up into multiple formats
you can slice it into video clips you
can have long form written pieces you
can use AI to you know
reformat other versions of content based
on the transcripts but still this
original Ip I think is something that AI
can't yet create
so yep one of the reasons Kelly and I
started the HR Heretics podcast is
because we felt that there was a gap
between what people wanted to hear
and what people needed to
hear how do you think about the stuff
that the HR Community needs to hear but
isn't as receptive to how do you think
about like do you put that into the
world do you filter that like what is
your thought process on some of those
pieces of content yeah I mean I I try
not to filter much like um honestly in
my I mean I'm at like 170 episodes now I
can only think of like one or two where
they've even been edited other than like
ums and like or of a guest flub
something was like hey could you like I
don't think I've ever actually edited a
piece of content of what somebody said
um and I've had guests on that I don't
agree with right I've had guests on
sharing ideas that don't necessarily
align with my own views um and frankly
I've taken [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know from that from
my audience at times where they're like
why did you platform that person why did
you give them a voice and I'm just like
you know my goal as as a as a host isn't
just to to make everybody feel good
about a certain topic it's to it's to
try to surface conversations and ideas
and topics that I think we need to
understand and we need to be thinking of
and they may not be things that we agree
with um but that doesn't necessarily
mean that we don't need to know about
them or be aware of them and I know that
that is a a fine line and I think that
we're you know we're also in this time
where I think it can be certain ideas
can be extremely polarizing and you know
certain people will have strongly held
beliefs that like platforming an idea
they don't agree with under any
circumstances is wrong and you shouldn't
do it and they're entitled to that
opinion but I I don't view that as as my
role I think my role is to try to
illuminate topics and ideas and Concepts
that are important to the field of HR
and that includes not just HR
perspectives that includes perspectives
from CEOs and Business Leaders who view
our field from a different lens and I
think uh frankly and you know that's one
of the things that we you need more of
in our space is I think that the the the
Pod the general kind of HR podcast if
you will ecosystem has certainly grown
and there's some great podcasts out
there um but I think we we need more we
did put a little bit more effort into
telling the stories from the business on
what they need and expect from us um
because our role is a business function
and we have to be able to think about
those um you know whether they're
consumers of our you know Services uh or
Partners like we have to see how we have
to understand how they see us and how
they think about us uh even when we
don't like how they see us and how they
think about us I gu sure gets a bad WAP
but I could not agree more hey everyone

and tell I'm Nolan and Kelly from HR
Heretics Cent
 
you like the worst thing you could do is
to just kind of affiliate yourself and
listen or or eat the things that only
that only you agree with in that you are
right I mean in these HR roles we see
everything um I've had to you know work
with people that I frankly very much
disliked or had different views on life
and my my rights for example and and and
the goal I think is to understand the
whole consideration set because you're
always going to have to work with
everyone those that you agree with and
don't and if you don't understand
everything you can't do that effectively
and so I think that's what nol and I
have tried to do as well and frankly
we've tooken heat as well and it's like
don't don't think that this is my view
but that's the goal is to dissect
everything yeah and it's hard I think we
do have a role to be
um while we're doing this also be
intentional around the the you know who
we are platforming in some cases and
what Stories We Are uplifting and
servicing that might not have the same
access right so I I think that that
piece is a responsibility that that we
have and I think we need to try working
on and we can always do better frankly
in that sense um but it's interesting
like I think we we are our work is so
volatile the environment that we work in
is so volatile and you know I remember
recording a podcast with somebody um
soon after January 6th and uh you know
they were pissed livid like many people
were and they were just like you know
half of my company is celebrating this
like how the hell do I live with that
how the hell do I like try to be
balanced or neutral uh in an environment
like this where like this is just such
an embarrassment and I'm so like
frustrated by these events and
so it's it's tough like I I'll never say
that it's easy and and I will also say
and I try to do this often that like I
get to be a bit of an armchair
quarterback right where like I'm not in
I'm not an operator today I'm not in the
trenches I'm not doing this work and I
try to own that all the time because I'm
like it's easy for me to have this
perspective that I do because it's not
in the trenches right now uh as some of
these other operators are so the
perspective is a bit easier for me to
have but those are the real kind of
things that we're we're navigating as
people leaders and I think those are the
things we have to talk about the thing
that Kelly to go back to your question
of like where does media ago in three
years the thing I'm most worried about
is I where I think it's been going and I
think will continue to go is into these
Echo Chambers to where it's like you
there's so much content being produced
that you could just go to the content
that makes you feel good and that's why
I asked Lars the question because I
actually you know I'm a I'm a frequent
listener and I do hear you bring up
opposing topics and the thing that I
would just encourage our audience to
continue to to lean into is that even if
stuff makes you
uncomfortable and when you initially
hear it and you may never agree with it
but I think we have to be more open to
changing our
minds that's the thing I'm most
concerned about right now with just the
state of our society is that we get an
idea in our head of the way that the
world should work and then we hear
opposing ideas to that and we're
immediately rejecting those ideas and
and for me personally one of the reasons
I wanted to do this show is because when
I worked with Henry who was the CEO of
ca he said a ton of crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all the
time and I thought it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nuts
and it turns out like like 12 to 18
months into my job I was like oh my God
he's right like 70 to 80% of the time
and I'm wrong and it just it was like
this huge Epiphany to me of like when I
started to hear other perspectives
that I initially thought were completely
off
base it what if they were right like
what if I could steal man that side of
the argument and that's what I'm I'm
hoping to see more in our industry
because uh I am worried that HR is
becoming too much of an of an echo
chamber and Kelly you and I have taken a
lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sounds like you've taken a
lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for having opposing opinions
but I do think actually one of our jobs
as content creators is to present the
other side doesn't mean you have to
change your mind but I do think you need
to be able to hear that that's the thing
like I I would say it's not it's not
even about changing your mind it's about
being open to understanding the why
behind all different opinions because
that's what the HR role is it's not just
having one and rejecting the other it's
being able to explain all even if you
choose one or you believe in one and I
do believe that that is a key element to
be being successful anywhere doesn't
have to be in business or in HR but
being successful anywhere
is to be able to understand and take in
the entire consideration set to then be
be better versus to your point KN in
this rejection and that immediate
knee-jerk rejection I think can be can
be you know tailored back to many
different reasons why someone does that
right but yeah that's that's the goal
and that's why I listen to content and
whatnot is to expand knowledge not
contract to your point about the echo
chamber I think there's also something
to be said around like um an ability to
understand and appreciate nuance and
gray zones and I think that that you
know we're kind of in this like
polarized time in so many regards right
where it's like it's this or it's that
and and and and if if you and no matter
where you stand right if you're if
you're locked into this or that you have
a real hard time seeing the other side
or or even being open to like what can I
learn from the other side and and I've
always you know tried being very
comfortable um being open to being wrong
so I I'll I'll have an opinion I'll have
a view but I'll I'll listen and you know
maybe my view will be the same maybe my
view will be reinforced maybe my view
will be softened because I understand a
different perspective and and to kind of
put more meat on the analogy I think
specifically like we have to like honor
the fact that we're you know three you
know white people talking about the the
the world of work and and there's a lot
of uh there's a lot of nuance in life
experience that we just don't have and
so for us like if we are if we're
wanting to kind of Build a Better World
of work we have to we have to own that
we have to understand that we have to do
our best to
proactively grow and learn in those
areas and and in doing so that also
means we're probably going to make
mistakes along the way I've made tons of
mistakes uh along the way especially as
it relates to trying to you know better
understand you know Dei and better
better kind of build more inclusive
companies and and and you whether it's
you know you know platforming
individuals or just learning more about
like experiences that are not my lived
experiences but um I I've I've been very
fortunate and again like this is where
I'm kind of open to feedback I've been
very fortunate that I've had a lot of
learning moments over my career
especially as you know a Creator writing
things were like I I may have approached
things in one way with a a complete lack
of awareness how something might be
interpreted um by people with different
life experiences that I've had and then
I've had people kind of call me out and
and or call me in even you know to say
hey you know what like this is how this
came off and you know I know you so I I
you know I don't think you meant it this
way but just know that this is how it
came off and like those moments for me
have been really enlightening because
they've they've helped me realize that
like it doesn't really matter what your
intentions are necessarily like it's how
they're received and and so I think it's
just for me it's like it's planted the
seed to always try to be thinking about
that um when it comes to like stories or
content or ideas or concepts um because
I'm you know middle-aged white male I am
the peak of privilege right with a lot
of the things that I've been afforded
and it doesn't mean that I haven't
worked harder like there's no reason to
even get into that but like that is
that's all real that's all very tangible
and so like those are things that I
think especially as a creator that I I
try to be mind I don't always get it
right um but I try to kind of have in
the back of my mind yeah I found that
more often than not you know multiple
things are usually true at the same
time yeah that's lars's point on Nuance
um I I just finished Tim Urban's what's
our problem book and I I'm going to do a
longer post about it in the next week or
two but the the point around Nuance Lars
I think is really really well said and
we just live in this time right now uh
to where it's just so everything is
polarized and it's we're we're trying to
filter decisions into right or wrong
black or white yes or no and 95% of the
world is in this gray one of the goals
with our show is like we're trying to
help people navigate that I see you
doing that too and I just want to call
it out and appreciate it because I think
we just need that in society I'm worried
about how much appetite there will be
for it in the near future I mean look
I'm an optimist by default I will always
be an optimist by default but I also
worry I mean look we're heading into
what will be the most contentious
election cycle that the the US has ever
seen uh UK is g to be going through
something similar soon after uh this is
happening around the world like the
polarization the the othering of uh
people that don't share your views yeah
it's it's hard to kind of look at the
trends of where all is going and find
reason for like hope and optimism that
like something will happen that we'll
find a way past that but you've got to
hold on to that hope I certainly do um
but but yeah I think if you're if you're
not concerned you're probably not paying
attention yep well said so transitioning
here to the Amplified Community um tell
us a little bit about that Community how
big is it and then what is that
Community talking about as it relates to
you know we're in the middle of May in
 
that uh I launched kind of this
iteration of it I launched soon after my
last book um redefining HR was published
so I had a lot of people you know
reading the book and responding and then
saying um where can I go to continue my
education um like modern HR and at that
time there really wasn't many places
that uh I felt comfortable sending
people I mean there they're more now so
I'd have a better answer now if I was
asked that question but then I didn't
and so I said well what if I built a
community aimed at like connecting and
developing and supporting the next
generation of cheap people officers and
so that's kind of how that came to be
and it started with like leadership
development cohorts uh originally
started as the the amplify Academy it's
kind of evolved into the amplifi
community now uh there's about 800
members across 40 over 40 countries um
that make it up today uh you can learn
more about it amplify talent.com
Community but um in terms of
conversations I mean it is uh it's you
know any number of things that I think
will mirror what you're seeing on uh
LinkedIn so um how to deal with uh
layoffs and burnout and instability of
just this environment lots of
conversations around searching for job
in HR because a lot of people are you
know on the receiving end of layoffs and
kind of looking for work um uh you know
what are the current uh how to stay
committed to diversity inclusion efforts
uh when we have this kind of these
headwinds that we're seeing especially
in Tech right now around like budgets
and resources being cut um how to build
you know better how to become Better
Business Leaders uh and build that
business Acumen how to influence the sea
suite and Leadership I mean it's
interesting like as you mentioned like
I'm very active on LinkedIn uh you know
I think a lot of the conversations that
I see in our community mirror a lot of
the broader conversations that I see on
link in which miror conversations that
I'm seeing happening in other people
leader communities that I'm a part of
right so it's like I think we're all
kind of navigating similar things uh as
a as a leadership you know cohort what
is what is one thing that that you're
seeing over the years Lars that that has
always kind of been there across HR that
either is still a gap today or we
haven't progressed enough and some of
the reasons why you think those blocks
are there you know we can still get a
lot better at building business Acumen
but that's kind of more of an obtuse
concept that I don't really want to you
know get into the the weeds of um you
know one of there something I've been
talking about um that I think is
particularly relevant now uh is we
really suck at being
selfish and I've written about this so
like if you've you know read anything
I've written or heard any podcast you're
watching this feel free to like Fast
Forward 30 seconds right if you want to
kind of get this again but for those of
you haven't like the our work is so hard
the demands of our job are so difficult
right and it's easy for us to just like
have our head pulled down and be so
committed to that work that we're not
taking enough time to think about our
own growth and our own development and
you know look at like the wave of this
you know new round of generative AI
That's impacting everything and it's a
it's a runaway freight train at this
point and if we're not paying attention
to this we're going to get swept up by
it and so it's like I think we have to
do a better job like we all talked about
the analogy of like putting on your own
face mask before putting on others face
masks in the pandemic and how we suck at
that as an industry we still suck at
that the selfish analogy applies to that
as well like we have to be very mindful
around the time that we're investing in
our own growth and development as as
practitioners As Leaders um because a it
makes our own career more resilient and
in the volunteer volatility that we've
experienced last couple years like
obviously that is crucially important uh
makes us more resilient in the age of AI
which is a really important distinction
uh and ultimately it brings more value
to our business you know if we're
increasing if we're if we're diligent
about increasing our capabilities and
our understanding and our growth mindset
we're bringing more value to our
employer right and we never we never
think about that we're always like oh I
I want to you know take this course but
oh I have so many deadlines and
deliverables like I don't have time and
like that's an excuse that will always
be there it has always been there it
will always be there we've got to break
that cycle and and and find way to make
time to focus on our own growth and
development because it's just it's too
Dynamic of an environment that we're in
and too volatile of an environment for
us and that if we don't do that it's at
our Peril so I will I will beat the drum
yeah on that as something that we need
to change because uh again it's like
it's 360 value it's value to us it's
value to our future selves and it's
value to our
employers well said that's that's such a
Lars ISM right there so what Lars I
think is really good at is taking
actually like hard feedback and
packaging it in a way that makes you
feel really good about hearing it like
that's like that's like a like my
version of the insult sandwich is that
is that that no no no no it's it's a
compliment because basically like
another way to frame it is is like we're
not uh in this industry people leaders
don't have their head out looking around
at the rest of the business they don't
have their head out looking at at
technology um they're kind of like have
their blinders on
and so like I just I I love the way that
you
frame constructive feedback and it's
something that I've been working on
because I think it makes it really
digestible for people and it's in the
version that they want to hear it which
is investing in yourself yeah that's
really well said well I mean for me it's
like I wanna I want to empower people I
don't want to tear people down right and
so it's like I think I always try to see
the good in people I always try to like
help them see that because I think some
people struggle to see the good in
themselves and so it's like I this is
more of like a call to action for our
field and like it will Elevate us
collectively just like open source did
in the early days of Open Source right
it made us better collectively it got us
out of this like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] War for talent
you know Zero Sum we all have to compete
with each other mindset which was like
totally always manufactured like that
was never true but like we believed it
and now we don't right and so now it's
like you're a relic of the past if
you're like well why would I share this
practice like this is my competitive
Advantage right like yeah good luck with
that mindset right like you gota you got
to move on and so I think this is just
you know really like a call to action
for us to like say okay look we got I
mean you you can zero in on AI and
that's easy to do right now so let's
just do it right it's easy uh but like
the I say it's a runaway train like it
is like there's no going back in this so
like we can be in denial around that we
can we can point out validly and we
should be pointing out that there's
issues with bias and there's issues
there's lots of issues that we have to
be mindful of and account accounting of
but this is happening whether we're
doing that or not and if we're not in
those rooms we meaning HR leaders if
we're not steering the policy around how
and where we're going to use generative
AI how and where we won't use generative
AI it's G to happen without us and then
it's going to happen to us like we have
to be this is where and to have those
conversations we have to be informed we
have to be playing with perplexity we
have to be watching open AI you know new
product release that happened yesterday
when they're talking about
gp40 you know coming out and the new you
know uh computer vision that's going to
be embedded in it and and what that
means for business like we have to have
a point of view on these things we have
to be aware of these things and if we're
not we're doing our our field and our
businesses and ourselves a disservice so
I just want to make that like that call
to action to people that like you you
you get in there you've got to get in
there because if if you're not it's
gonna happen whether you are or not and
if you're not it's going to happen to
you as opposed to with you totally yep
one of the things I'm I'm continually
learning from you is just like how to
package that in a way to where people
can actually hear it versus field
defensive I think you do that really
well all right last thing for me is
you've also built a search firm for
people leaders specifically yep what do
you see as the common traits as the best
in the
field yeah I mean look there are so many
qualities to me I think the CPO is one
of the hardest jobs in the SE Suite um
for a range of reasons but like you have
to have a m of your own domain that's
table Stakes but you have to really
understand the business you have to
understand the financials you have to
understand the go to market strategy you
have to understand the competitive
landscape and threats you have to
understand the funding and the runway
you have to understand how the strategy
May pivot in the next couple years what
that might mean for the talent that you
have or that you need you're entering
this new era of you know AI is now part
of the workforce quote unquote so you
are now also a talent architect that has
to be thinking about okay this is our
strategic plan as a business how do we
achieve that through a mix of FTE
Outsourcing Freelancers guilds
Automation and AI uh right like this is
a very complex job and then you're also
overseeing the most volatile asset a
company has which is its people so it's
a very difficult time in terms of traits
you need to be successful learning
agility certainly is one I mean that the
two biggest that I often key in are
learning agility and network Equity I
think those two pieces are essential um
resiliency is essential like let's face
it you know you are going to get caught
holding the bag even when it's not your
responsibility a lot of the times that's
just the nature of this work you're
gonna get thrown under the bus by your
peers um you're gonna have to deal with
like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] storm of like the
aftermath of a January 6th what do we do
what do we say uh you know Russia just
invaded Ukraine we have employees in
Ukraine what do we do um we have
employees in Israel
um we we lost employees in in Israel or
in Palestine um what do we do right like
these are very human volatile massive
things that you have to deal with so
that that resiliency is key um but also
really the thing that I think separates
the Great and the Exceptional from the
good is that trust you have to be able
to build that trust with your founder or
CEO with your seite peers you have to be
able to have have that level of trust in
order to be a truth teller to them
because you have to tell them some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
they don't want to hear sometimes yep
and that's your job like that is the job
and I think that's the biggest struggle
that I think these we're in an a point
right now where like a lot of the
seasoned cpos are moving out of the
field we have this next generation of
cpos moving in the field they have not
experienced those moments of like
uncomfortable
 
truthtellah you know in that role but
it's it's critical for your success and
so you know the there are people who are
moving into these roles that maybe
aren't comfortable enough doing that and
they're allowing their company to kind
of make some bad decisions and go in the
wrong direction sometimes because you
know they haven't really you know
established that trust and so you know
all of those things I think have to be
there to really be uh an exceptional uh
people leader today that was my you know
last question for you Lars is is in the
the talent demand supply of of the cpos
out there and I got the sense that there
has been this generational kind of turn
happening where us OG's if you will or
old people are starting to move out and
there's a new generation coming up is
that true are you seeing some people
come back are you trying to get those
ogs back in those seats and why aren't
they coming how are you preparing or
presenting the the Next Generation up
that's a whole dynamic that I've been
kind of watching the last few years uh
it's a whole thing and it is what's
happening right and so I think that you
have it's it's it's the perfect storm of
a couple things right so for one you
have those season those OG leaders uh
they're burned out they're tired they're
stepping out and that stepping out may
be moving into coaching it may be moving
into advisory roles it may be moving in
taking sabatical and maybe retiring in
some cases but there's an exodus at that
top level there's more of an appetite
for people leaders across the board so
you have especially in Venture B
companies uh they're tending to hire
heads of people earlier because they've
lived through the mistakes of what
happens when you wait too long and you
break your infrastructure at 500 people
and then you know it's painful to build
again which you know I'm sure both of
you have experienced probably have seen
so uh so there's more of an appetite on
the Venture backside you also had more
companies um that maybe underinvested in
HR during the early days of the pandemic
they were exposed because their HR
wasn't capable of meeting that moment um
and so they've realized hey you know
what we actually need to be investing
this a critical business function we
have to invest more in this so those
companies are now maybe who would have
gotten by on maybe a director or VP like
they're now hiring a chief or a VPO so
there's more demand there's less
Supply um I think it's putting more
stress in this next level of leadership
I mean frankly that was one of the
reasons why I launched the amplify
Talent Community I wanted to there
weren't enough platforms developing that
next Generation like there's a lot of
great communities that tailor to
existing cpos and existing head of
people but there really wasn't much
catering on that next Generation that
like their direct report line or maybe
even a notch below so building up that
group but I'm also seeing in some cases
uh those season you know ogs as you say
moving back in right who Maybe started
coaching and they did that for a while
they did a sabatical and they're just
like you know what okay like I'm I'm
ready to get back in the uh in the arena
so to speak so I don't think that that
that cohort of experienced cpos who left
in you know Midway through the mic I
don't think they're gone forever I think
some of those are coming back um and so
yeah it's a mix of all of those yes for
sure awesome cool Lars this has been a
total blast please come back on the pot
I've learned a ton from you in this
episode and I think our audience is
going to love this one yeah this is
great thanks Lars yeah well no kitty I
appreciate you having me on and uh again
thanks for hosting uh these
conversations and uh giving me an
opportunity to share some BS thank you
