all right hey everyone how are you doing
welcome to another segment here on HR
Heretics we have our good friend Jeff
Diana back on with us today for a short
segment you know Jeff he's been around
the block few times multiple times CPO
board member adviser Etc so how you
doing Je doing well good to catch up yep
same so Nolan Jeff and I went to the
Elevate conference in La couple months
ago this was the one hosted by NOC CPO
HQ it was great it was very intimate 100
people a lot of great conversations a
mansion in LA was also great and
interesting but so Jeff moderated a
panel that I sat on with a couple
friends and it was all about this
concept that we all know about HR people
being business people first and some of
people were like I'm so tired of hearing
this like it's just been this thing for
years has the puck really moved and so
it was a really good chat and we thought
in this segment we could kick the ball
around a little and share some
highlights some other questions get your
take as well Nolan that's my initial
take when I hear that is like oh my god
I've heard this discussion but it
actually hasn't translated into any
specific action for the most part so
what what did you guys talk about what
happened and so that was it people were
like uh it's like the old HRS at the
table like Jesus what does that mean and
so it was all about not just saying this
stuff and talking at 880,000 FT but what
do you do what does that tactically mean
in unpacking what the hell that is so
that people that were there could take
away some things to do and so the first
thing we kind of said is like HR is
Business Leaders first that is the most
you know like what the hell does that
mean so we talked about what does that
mean in your mind as far as like break
it down Jeff Nolan and I can too on what
exactly that means because it's been
thrown around so many times I ask 10
people I get seven different answers
yeah I turn it to your point it's kind
of funny because this conversation is
going going on for a while and there was
frustration that we're still having it
yet I think at the same time there was
still an acknowledgement that we're not
there yet right so we can be frustrated
by it but what the heck do we do about
it when I think about being that
business leader first mentality I like
to think about it in sort of dos and
don'ts and the coraly I give is we
always talk about our values in it but
and you're like what does it look like
and sometimes people are good by seeing
the what you do and sometimes they're
like the absolutely don't dos right or
it's equally
valuable so to me when you start a
conversation when you dissect an issue
where do you start from do you start
from classic HR oriented activities like
what programs do we offer will are
people like it will they be happy with
it like we're in our own track of
thinking a business leader first HR
person starts by understanding what is
the financial variables what's our Trend
within it how is that tracking to where
the business would like to be how does
it look relative to competitors or the
market so it's all about those financial
measures those external variables those
Trends in our company performance
nowhere in there is how will it impact
our people will our people be happy with
it how do we sell it to our people it's
all about that business orientation
market and customer landscape so
starting with those measures I think is
the number one way that I see people
talk about it and when I talk about it
and people tell me you don't seem like a
an HR person at all part of me gets very
frustrated at that comment I know
there's a complement in it and when you
ask them to unpack it they say one you
can talk the numbers as well as a
functional leader and two you never give
me any of that HR speaker HR jargon and
so on the don't list to me that's
important I never start with we ought to
do this it's the right thing to do kind
of concept now I have that lens guiding
me not not only a personal moral compass
but a cultural compass for the company
but it's not my plan of attack and how I
speak or how I try and influence on a
decision and so those kind of two
elements to me are probably the best
examples I can give you yeah let me add
to that Jeff so one of the things that
we did at door Dash is we made every
single employee Dash once a month it was
either Dash or due customer support once
a month and I thought it was really
annoying when I first heard about it
it's like oh my God I have so much
to do this is really what I'm gonna have
to go do next and it turned out it had
some really positive benefits for us one
was it got my team incredibly intimate
with the business and the product
specifically with like how the product
works and what's interesting is is like
once you understand how the product
works then you can understand all of the
people that are working on that product
and the problems that are trying to
solve and you can more deeply empathize
with them so you know for us it was like
once we started to do that then the
second order of that was like the
business stopped thinking about us as
like the team on an island in a corner
you know doing recruiting or doing HR
and it was more like actually these are
our partners because they deeply
understand what we're doing why we're
doing how we make money and how the
business operates that's like for me I
think the essence and and stuff that I
try and drive into folks that I work
with now is like well have you got on a
phone call like with a s with your sales
team have you done customer support
because I immediately like it does not
take that long a couple of hours a month
and the next thing you know there's
going to be a sound bite around you and
your team that is not like it's the team
in the corner it's like holy Nolan
and a couple of his folks came and
actually tried to sell with us yesterday
like what other HR leader does that
that's where I think people should start
and then I think there's like all these
second order things of understanding the
p&amp;l and stuff like that but man just get
your hands on the business and get in
there I love it I mean the other one I
talk about is product certification
right whether your company requires it
when you join or not especially if
you're in the software space it's like
do you go through the certification that
are people deploying the technology will
do or the people troubleshooting it from
a customer success perspective and you
get this depth of knowledge of the
feature set why we use it what are the
personas that use it right this richness
customer but what I love about what you
said noan is there's just a visual to
you literally sat with the people in the
business which is always funny because
of course we are too but you've created
this brand and visual that like well
they're real they're serious they're
interested they're involved they're not
sitting in isolation just in their
functional area and I think that's an
awesome one one litmus test that I often
you know when I was in the seat I used
to say is like in the last two weeks who
on the SE Suite team have I had had like
a very very intense conversation about
our business and our Direction like no
HR no nothing but who have I gone
toe-to-toe with not necessarily
toe-to-toe but who have I chatted with
about what we're doing where we're going
Etc that was a big witness test for me
because I think that starts to change
you know the perception of us only
talking about the the HR stuff and
there's two things that I'll add that I
I really didn't think about enough early
in my career that I think are pretty
actually powerful and one is not just do
you know your business the one that you
sit in but do you understand the market
landscape the competitive nature can you
talk about what you're doing in relation
to what's going on outside because
that's where I've seen and I've actually
myself gotten kind of stumped or brick
walled where the conversation quickly
went to competitive nature and whatnot
and I couldn't really talk to that and
that that that that is a speed bump the
second one and this is kind of
interesting because it might be
controversial is I don't think you can
be a great influencer and a business
leader and founder Le companies unless
you understand how the founder is
actually irrational maybe irrational
about their business about their product
about their baby
because that matters right like you can
come with all the data and all the stuff
but I mean Nolan's a CEO and if it's
something that he feels so VIs Cal about
and so emotional about you have to talk
about that a little bit differently and
you're not going to get very far and so
I just want to put it out there that
understanding and somewhat empathizing
with this this founder emotion is a big
part of leading the business yeah and I
think look to your point around
influencing why do you do that why do
you get out there and talk to the
customer and do CS it's like so you
understand literally how the the work
unfolds in the business you can talk
intelligently about it why do you have
to understand the business economics to
do the same thing because when you're in
that room with other leaders they're
talking about the
overall impact of the company on its
financials on its shareholders on its
customers so we don't have that level of
knowledge we can't contribute one thing
you said Kelly to me is like knowing
knowing the numbers like when I think
about this and I talk to folks in HR
that are like I want to be more business
oriented I'll usually ask them and I'm
thinking of layers of the cake around
the metrics right usually simple
question like do you know your operating
plan and the goals sure know that now
they may not know how that work unfolds
to no one's point of like being in the
track doing it I may ask them like well
do you understand our financials usually
I get a little bit more wobble I might
be able to tell you the AR growth number
but can they really go through and
dissect the financials then I ask them
like within those two things do you
really understand the functional metrics
of our business like what is CS
measuring what do they care about what
is engineering driving what is the
marketing team looking at do you even
know the top metrics let alone the
Trends on them and that's all still
insul then you go to the outside of like
what about our competitors do you know
their health do you know their
performance do you know the broader
Market landscape do you understand
macroeconomic Trends going on in the
world and around interest rates the flow
of money and the price of money like
there's so many layers to this cake and
the most effective HR leaders are well
schooled in all of those and they
leverage all of those in the
conversation because what I actually
find fascinating as much as we feel like
we're at this position of lack of
literacy and we are guess what most of
our functional leaders can't cover all
those layers of the cake either so if
you can and you can have some knowledge
as broad as macroeconomics to markets to
competitors to us and you have some
insight across that and you bring that
into the conversation now you're not
only adding real value to the business
but you have legitimacy to your voice in
a way you've never had before so Jeff
that's such a great point you know going
back to to Door Das so door Das is a
three-sided business very complicated
business and I remember like in my
second or third week I sat in a wbr
weekly Business review and I had no idea
what anybody was talking about like I I
felt like the emperor had no closed
moment of like holy like I don't
get any of this and and there's a couple
things that you can do when you
experience one of those moments one is
is you could just like try and pick it
up as time goes on I tried to do that
for another week and I was like I'm
still not getting this stuff and so what
I ended up doing was I grabbed I grabbed
one of our finance leaders and I was
like hey can you just show me the p&amp;l
and tell me about the things that you
look at like where does your eye go
every month and every quarter and tell
me why and that was such an Illuminating
conversation for me because it was like
I I was able to ask the stupid question
my ego got over like oh I don't know
everything and by asking that stupid
question it brought him in to be like oh
Nolan really cares like Nolan actually
like wants to understand this thing and
I think oftentimes you know in our
function we we do have a lot going on so
we're busy number one but the second
thing is we don't want to appear stupid
we don't want to appear like we don't
know something and I've always found
that if you can frame the question the
right way asking the quote unquote dumb
question actually brings in more
partners of the business to help you get
your job done and also like brings them
more empathy and it shows them that you
care about it yeah and that's my
question like this sounds this sounds
wonderful we're Business Leaders We Know
It All blah blah blah like you guys know
I mean we don't know we're on the seat
but people are strapped resources are
slim people don't even have time to go
to the bathroom during the HR job most
of the time like how the hell do you
gain all this knowledge like what is
what is both of your advice on how to
achieve this without you know working 50
hours a day like it's hardly I would I'd
call BS on that I don't have time to do
that I know we're all crazy busy but
you're making an investment that will
allow you to have more influence be
smarter to make better decisions
prioritize your work like yes you have
to find a few hours to do that but the
payoff will be more than the time you
invest for sure so I I think that's
important to me I do a couple things
like I'm with no one I I actually go to
the fpna leader that's the finance
person I hit because they look across
the business they're in the data they're
in the trends and by the way they often
get no voice they're sort of the behind
the scenes person of the CFO or the
business line Finance people so that's a
place I go they have knowledge they want
to share it I don't even think it's so
much about asking dumb questions and I
don't worry about asking dumb questions
I think you're just asking them to share
their expertise and there's not a human
on the planet that doesn't feel good
when they're approached to share their
expertise and they acknowledged as being
smart and having value to add like we
talk about it all the time with our
broad-based employees they don't feel
valued enough like so go do it talk to
your fpna leader the second person I
talk to sales Ops leader they run all
the territories the commissions the
trends what's going on there so I sort
of get broad-based from the finance
leader macro conditions and cost metrics
and I get a deeper click on growth from
the sales Ops leader and by the way not
only do I gain knowledge I get to size
up those people which is a big part of
my job anyways by having these deep
conversations with them and you force
them to be able to explain things at an
elementary level that often gives them
an aha moment of what they know or can
they say it simpler to reach the masses
in the company and so it has all sorts
of goodness in those couple
conversations so one is talk to those
people two read there is so much
freaking stuff out there in public
filings and analyst reports or your
business plan plan in your company like
there's great ways to get that knowledge
and then the last one I really like to
do is practice pitching the business
like every HR meeting I have I will
pitch the financial report we did in the
leadership team meeting it at nauseum so
I know not only where my gaps are if I
had to Pitch hit in an investor meeting
for the CFO I should be able to do it
and if I can explain that to my team
I'll fine-tune my pitch and my knowledge
also be bringing the HR function along
where they often lack that level of
acumine as well same thing with pitching
Executives in the search process is like
if I can really talk to them about my
business to sell them on it and answer
their tough questions on why you versus
competitors I feel like I'm building
that muscle yeah the the sales Ops and
the finance P that's a that's a great
start I could not agree more the third
leg I'd throw in there is the customer
success side there's so many questions
what do they say what do they like why
are they leaving why are they staying
what are like you can get so much
information from that group and Founders
really care about their customers I mean
that is a big freaking conversation at
any sea Suite table especially in you
know preo companies it's it's a great
way to spend time as well hey everyone
we'll be right back in a moment after a
word from our sponsors Real Talk most
Talent leaders haven't yet cracked how
to leverage AI for Meaningful impact on
their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting team's efficiency and quality
use metav view metaview is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
candidates during calls and save time on
the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline hiring teams
can make confident informed decisions
and talent leaders can finally take
control of the interview process join
forward-thinking Talent leaders at high
performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and Kora and check out
metaview head over to metav view. a/h
Heretics to talk to one of metav VI's
product experts or get started for free
you'll be uppr running an AI enabled in
minutes
I'll take it even like a step further so
Kelly your initial question was is like
God everyone's so strapped like how do
you create time for this and when you
are strapped I always think about well
like what's the one Domino that's going
to knock down like four or five and this
is like it it actually doesn't feel like
it does because it doesn't tie to like
your Tactical HR or recruiting work but
it turns out it actually does and when
you're doing the things that you guys
just said I think those are awesome
strategies to deploy I would actually
say like have recurring meetings with
those people because what you find is is
then you're able to go to the executive
meeting and you're able to provide
Insight sometimes that your other
partners actually don't have one of the
things I always say to my friends who
are in in exec roles is like get out of
the Ivory Tower like just get out of the
tower get to the ground and you're going
to figure out a lot of things by just
getting down in there with your
compatriots and I find that like when
you actually do those sorts of things
you're able to come to the exec meeting
with insights that like could illuminate
something that your Finance or your go
to market leader doesn't even know yeah
another thing that I mean I've been
doing for years and I think it's a nice
forcing function if you don't do it and
shows the business that you're serious
is do you do qbrs and operating reviews
for the people's side right do you
unpack that and run it as a business
like all the other functions are
expected to and do you not just do that
yourself but you participate in the
other the functional wide operating
reviews and qbrs like we presented along
with marketing along with sales along
with products and taking that a step
further then we would Infuse so we would
do present our own Etc but we would have
slides within each of those functional
qbrs it's a people slide especially for
that function presented by that business
partner leader and that Talent
acquisition partner and if it's okay if
it's like crappy at first or a V1 just
get in there and it will evolve and you
will be not just viewed but you will be
a part of the fabric of how that
business runs totally Kelly and then and
then you take it when you're sitting in
the other ones then it is your job as a
leader to take those learnings back and
synthesize the learnings for your team
right because that's that's the main
thing is like hey it's great for you to
get this knowledge but if you if your
team can be a reflection of that then
all of a sudden like the the sound by
internally changes and and that's when
you really start to win the war and when
it's like we don't think of them as the
HR or recruiting team we just think of
them as our as our colleagues totally
and at first it might be like oh how
cute look HR wants to do a review like
fine you know take it get in the ring
and keep going I tell you two other
examples to me where it's helpful one
I've always pushed my team to say we can
impact the business as a function by
being the best run discipline in the
company and you think about what we want
to advise the company on it's their
spend their efficiency how well they
operate how well they execute their or
design all these types of things and so
I try to rally my team on and pride
myself on wanting to be recognized as
the best run function in the company
because there is respect from functional
and Business Leaders of like they know
how to run an amazing ship that's
everything from how we Define and
execute on work how well we can measure
what we do all of those types of
activities our operating rhythm of how
we meet how efficient it is because we
all know at the company level there's
inefficiency in there and if we can
demonstrate high performance I've been
at several companies where CEOs have
said you have the best run function of
the company help teach us how to run the
company more efficient more effectively
and that's not just squeezing cost right
that's how well we execute how well we
can predict how knowledgeable the team
is all of that type of stuff and it
gives HR teams something to Rally around
where we do feel like especially outside
of the sea Suite role you're like I'm
just deep in the business like I'm off
on an island I do this little functional
work now it's like no we can be about
the business show them something that
will impact the business and that gains
a ton of credibility yeah and also the
mobility right just to be you know a
little selfish for a minute we're seeing
more fluidity now with HR folks going
into the business and business folks
going into HR that that is I mean I was
in a go to market role for a year before
I left pendo and you don't you don't do
that unless you can demonstrate and
understand that you you know had value
so there's a lot of things around that
that are really cool that they could
open up with this too yeah I'll give you
a great example when I was at success
factors with with Lars I still remember
my first 30 days on the job and the
thing that Lars was most impressed with
was I went I asked to go to sales
kickoff HR had not typically gone and I
literally met every single salesp person
there I didn't sit at the dinner I went
table to table I met folks I asked what
they were working on I told them call
upon me now granted you know selfish
Advantage we're selling to HR so they
care a little bit more about what we
think yeah yeah but where did that lead
that led to the sales organization going
wow he gets it maybe we should get him
into some deals and and it led to my
team taking our own sales quota I had
two or three members make sales Club
every year I was there because we sold
so much for the business with the
business and that would have never
happened if I had just pitched the
concept but I got out into the business
they showed I was knowledgeable they
showed I cared that I was willing to
learn to roll up my sleeves and then
they were willing to let me into those
functional areas to have greater impact
so similar to your bit Nolan on spending
time with cs they're going to let you
into their business by virtue of you're
knowledgeable and you've sort of been
vetted that you get it and you're smart
and you're intelligent it's going to
open up opportunities to have more
impact for the the people function than
we will get
otherwise
amen this is great anything else from
you from you both on this for today no I
think I think you guys nailed it I'm at
like again for somebody who's like
generally annoyed with this topic I
think these are the the Tactical things
people should do in order to make sure
that they actually are thought of as as
a respected colleague which is the goal
awesome well great to see you Jeff thank
you for joining us yeah thank you both I
appreciate you letting me back on and
anytime I can help you you know give me
a shout good to see you Jeff all right
thanks everyone see you later see you
