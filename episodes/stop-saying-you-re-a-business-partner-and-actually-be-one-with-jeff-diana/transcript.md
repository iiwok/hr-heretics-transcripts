there's a complement in it and when you
ask them to unpack it they say one you
 
ask them to unpack it they say one you
can talk the numbers as well as a
 
can talk the numbers as well as a
functional leader and two you never give
 
functional leader and two you never give
me any of that HR speaker HR jargon and
 
me any of that HR speaker HR jargon and
so on the don't list to me that's
 
so on the don't list to me that's
important I never start with we ought to
 
important I never start with we ought to
do this it's the right thing to do kind
 
do this it's the right thing to do kind
of concept now I have that lens guiding
 
of concept now I have that lens guiding
me not not only a personal moral compass
 
me not not only a personal moral compass
but a cultural compass for the company
 
but a cultural compass for the company
but it's not my plan of attack and how I
 
but it's not my plan of attack and how I
speak or how I try and influence on a
 
speak or how I try and influence on a
decision and so those kind of two
 
decision and so those kind of two
elements to me are probably the best
 
elements to me are probably the best
examples I can give you yeah let me add
 
examples I can give you yeah let me add
to that Jeff so one of the things that
 
to that Jeff so one of the things that
