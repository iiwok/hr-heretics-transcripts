Etc and there was I still doing HR like
I'd done in the
 
I'd done in the

the BBC was coming to an end myself my
co-founder Karen Moran we went for a
 
co-founder Karen Moran we went for a
very long lunch in Covent Garden and
 
very long lunch in Covent Garden and
we're like look can we take our shared
 
we're like look can we take our shared
frustrations and do something with this
 
frustrations and do something with this
you know get off our backsides and
 
you know get off our backsides and
actually come up with ways in which HR
 
actually come up with ways in which HR
could be fit for a disrupted world so
 
could be fit for a disrupted world so
that's where disruptive HR comes from
 
that's where disruptive HR comes from
and and that's what we've been doing for
 
and and that's what we've been doing for
the last 10 11 years you know it's been
 
the last 10 11 years you know it's been
it's been amazing I love it still love
 
it's been amazing I love it still love
it because we get to work with HR
 
it because we get to work with HR
professionals who are open and curious
 
professionals who are open and curious
you don't come to disruptive HR if
 
you don't come to disruptive HR if
you've got a closed mind and you happy
 
you've got a closed mind and you happy
with the way things are you come to us
 
with the way things are you come to us
if you're interested in or believe that
 
if you're interested in or believe that
HR needs to be different um so yes
 
HR needs to be different um so yes
that's what we do so Lucy that's I want
 
that's what we do so Lucy that's I want
to ask you about that because um you
 
to ask you about that because um you
know you started the business 10 11
 
know you started the business 10 11
years ago and I do think at that time
 
years ago and I do think at that time
there was this Yearning For Change
 
there was this Yearning For Change
within HR to essentially go from a
 
within HR to essentially go from a
compliance and legal function to more of
 
compliance and legal function to more of
like a a strategic business partner
 
like a a strategic business partner
function and I think you guys nailed the
 
function and I think you guys nailed the
timing right like everyone was talking
 
timing right like everyone was talking
and so I think a lot of that has
 
and so I think a lot of that has
actually happened and we've seen kind of
 
actually happened and we've seen kind of
this next era but to to your point there
 
this next era but to to your point there
on you know people don't come to
 
on you know people don't come to
disruptive HR who don't want um who
 
disruptive HR who don't want um who
don't want change I actually am
 
don't want change I actually am
experiencing something else in the space
 
experiencing something else in the space
right now which is uh I'm calling it
 
right now which is uh I'm calling it
like this this homogeny of thinking
 
like this this homogeny of thinking
within HR which is there actually is
 
within HR which is there actually is
resistance to change there's resistance
 
resistance to change there's resistance
now to hearing outside opinions that
 
now to hearing outside opinions that
challenge especially what we were doing
 
challenge especially what we were doing
call it in the you know 2020 to 2023
 
call it in the you know 2020 to 2023
time
 
time
frame are do you agree with that there's
 
frame are do you agree with that there's
a lot in what you've said so just to
 
a lot in what you've said so just to
kind of unpack and maybe challenge a
 
kind of unpack and maybe challenge a
little bit um I don't think that the
 
little bit um I don't think that the
transition to strategic business partner
 
transition to strategic business partner
was ever nailed um you know I still meet
 
was ever nailed um you know I still meet
with a lot of HR professionals who are
 
with a lot of HR professionals who are
struggling to make that transition so I
 
struggling to make that transition so I
think there is still an appetite for
 
think there is still an appetite for
change what I do think where I do agree
 
change what I do think where I do agree
with you is that we made some step
 
with you is that we made some step
changes as a result of the crisis around
 
changes as a result of the crisis around
covid um understandably you know whether
 
covid um understandably you know whether
that be you know the whole kind of
 
that be you know the whole kind of
working from home or working
 
working from home or working
flexibly um a level of trust because we
 
flexibly um a level of trust because we
had to because we couldn't see people so
 
had to because we couldn't see people so
we were trusting them improvements in
 
we were trusting them improvements in
the way that we were communicating
 
the way that we were communicating
virtually and uh asynchronous
 
virtually and uh asynchronous
communication really helping with people
 
communication really helping with people
who are uh working both remotely but
 
who are uh working both remotely but
also across uh Global um
 
also across uh Global um
organizations so I think we made some
 
organizations so I think we made some
really important step changes which I'm
 
really important step changes which I'm
now seeing being road back on so you
 
now seeing being road back on so you
know the the leaders who are coming out
 
know the the leaders who are coming out
and saying everybody back into the
 
and saying everybody back into the
office office we need to see you to
 
office office we need to see you to
trust you um that I think is a real
 
trust you um that I think is a real
shame because I think we did make some
 
shame because I think we did make some
step changes which perhaps weren't as
 
step changes which perhaps weren't as
solidified and we did they not they
 
solidified and we did they not they
didn't stick but but is it is it a real
 
didn't stick but but is it is it a real
shame like I I mean I get it personally
 
shame like I I mean I get it personally
that I want to work remotely and like
 
that I want to work remotely and like
that's a choice for me but you know what
 
that's a choice for me but you know what
Kelly and I always talk about along with
 
Kelly and I always talk about along with
one of our friends call mccre is the
 
one of our friends call mccre is the
number one thing that's important is
 
number one thing that's important is
that companies Define themselves and if
 
that companies Define themselves and if
a company defines M themselves as having
 
a company defines M themselves as having
an in-office presence I I I'm not sure
 
an in-office presence I I I'm not sure
if like the broad stroke of saying like
 
if like the broad stroke of saying like
this is you know not not okay or we're
 
this is you know not not okay or we're
you know now as a field we're taking
 
you know now as a field we're taking
steps back I'm not sure if that applies
 
steps back I'm not sure if that applies
like what do you think about that well
 
like what do you think about that well
what I think is that it's a personal
 
what I think is that it's a personal
choice ideally and that I think
 
choice ideally and that I think
employees are
 
employees are
grown-ups um supposedly and leaders are
 
grown-ups um supposedly and leaders are
supposedly grown-ups and that the most
 
supposedly grown-ups and that the most
Progressive approaches are where you as
 
Progressive approaches are where you as
a leader sit with down with your team
 
a leader sit with down with your team
and say what works for us what works for
 
and say what works for us what works for
us as individuals what works for the
 
us as individuals what works for the
client what works for what we're doing
 
client what works for what we're doing
in in terms of the work at the moment so
 
in in terms of the work at the moment so
I love um Swiss re they have an
 
I love um Swiss re they have an
expression which is own the way you work
 
expression which is own the way you work
and that is you're a grown-up you know
 
and that is you're a grown-up you know
what you've got to deliver you know the
 
what you've got to deliver you know the
implications for the team you know
 
implications for the team you know
what's your social or caring obligations
 
what's your social or caring obligations
let's have a conversation and see what
 
let's have a conversation and see what
works you're not going to get everything
 
works you're not going to get everything
you want
 
you want
necessarily because you're not not
 
necessarily because you're not not
working in isolation but let's have a
 
working in isolation but let's have a
grown-up conversation and find something
 
grown-up conversation and find something
that can work so I think it's about that
 
that can work so I think it's about that
personal choice rather than I don't
 
personal choice rather than I don't
think working from home is good working
 
think working from home is good working
in the office is bad it depends on the
 
in the office is bad it depends on the
individual what the team's got going on
 
individual what the team's got going on
what the clients need and I think for
 
what the clients need and I think for
some people working in an office all the
 
some people working in an office all the
time is great and that's what they want
 
time is great and that's what they want
or that's what the clients need um but I
 
or that's what the clients need um but I
think it's about it's this blanket
 
think it's about it's this blanket
approach and so I think what we did was
 
approach and so I think what we did was
in HR uh we went for the two days out
 
in HR uh we went for the two days out
the office three days in which is just
 
the office three days in which is just
kind of it doesn't mean anything you
 
kind of it doesn't mean anything you
know you've got people who are now
 
know you've got people who are now
having to go in and commute and sit
 
having to go in and commute and sit
there and do their emails because it's
 
there and do their emails because it's
an in-office day rather than what what
 
an in-office day rather than what what
defines the work what is what's needed
 
defines the work what is what's needed
by the individuals there's a um a UK
 
by the individuals there's a um a UK
public sector body but they say you know
 
public sector body but they say you know
we come together when it has value and
 
we come together when it has value and
purpose and that's a judgment call and
 
purpose and that's a judgment call and
through discussion rather than this
 
through discussion rather than this
blanket approach because we don't trust
 
blanket approach because we don't trust
managers to be able to have a
 
managers to be able to have a
conversation or explain their reasoning
 
conversation or explain their reasoning
for why they want people in so now I'm
 
for why they want people in so now I'm
not a kind of you know all working from
 
not a kind of you know all working from
home is good and all working in the
 
home is good and all working in the
office is bad but I do think that people
 
office is bad but I do think that people
want and benefit from a degree of
 
want and benefit from a degree of
autonomy and that autonomy and control
 
autonomy and that autonomy and control
over how when where I work um can be a
 
over how when where I work um can be a
really powerful piece of engagement yeah
 
really powerful piece of engagement yeah
I mean to to Nolan's Point Lucy we have
 
I mean to to Nolan's Point Lucy we have
talked about this a lot um we've we've
 
talked about this a lot um we've we've
stretched it we've looked at all the
 
stretched it we've looked at all the
angles we've I mean we've talking about
 
angles we've I mean we've talking about
it for 18 months since this podcast
 
it for 18 months since this podcast
launched uh and some of the predict you
 
launched uh and some of the predict you
know hypothesis that we have is that a
 
know hypothesis that we have is that a
lot of folks struggle with this this RTO
 
lot of folks struggle with this this RTO
this remote this hybrid in office
 
this remote this hybrid in office
concept because they do try to blanket
 
concept because they do try to blanket
they kind of Follow the Leader and then
 
they kind of Follow the Leader and then
go back and they're not really secure
 
go back and they're not really secure
in their identity you know and the
 
in their identity you know and the
clarity of that identity and the why are
 
clarity of that identity and the why are
you are you seeing that across the
 
you are you seeing that across the
clients you work with how what are you
 
clients you work with how what are you
telling them yeah no it's a real mix and
 
telling them yeah no it's a real mix and
there's the full spectrum between you
 
there's the full spectrum between you
know everybody back in the office the
 
know everybody back in the office the
kind of classic will let you work from
 
kind of classic will let you work from
home some of the time two to three days
 
home some of the time two to three days
with any without any real clarification
 
with any without any real clarification
about why two to three days um and then
 
about why two to three days um and then
we've got the more Progressive more
 
we've got the more Progressive more
grownup organization that are saying
 
grownup organization that are saying
look we're not going to mandate this
 
look we're not going to mandate this
from the center actually sit down so ARA
 
from the center actually sit down so ARA
is an engineering company and the HR
 
is an engineering company and the HR
team there said look we're not going to
 
team there said look we're not going to
mandate when you work or how you work or
 
mandate when you work or how you work or
where you work but what we do expect you
 
where you work but what we do expect you
to do is have a conversation and
 
to do is have a conversation and
consider these points um about you know
 
consider these points um about you know
the nature of the work uh where can we
 
the nature of the work uh where can we
build in flexibility and that's really
 
build in flexibility and that's really
positive because it's giving a degree of
 
positive because it's giving a degree of
control without this kind of centralized
 
control without this kind of centralized
policy I think the identity point is an
 
policy I think the identity point is an
interesting one because I think
 
interesting one because I think
sometimes we can major on this idea that
 
sometimes we can major on this idea that
culture and identity comes from an
 
culture and identity comes from an
office or a physical presence um in
 
office or a physical presence um in
reality most organizations have multiple
 
reality most organizations have multiple
cultures depending on the team or the
 
cultures depending on the team or the
work that they're doing we just take the
 
work that they're doing we just take the
BBC you know the culture and journalism
 
BBC you know the culture and journalism
and the News guys was incredibly
 
and the News guys was incredibly
different to television or radio or
 
different to television or radio or
online I think it needs to be much more
 
online I think it needs to be much more
granular than um this idea that we have
 
granular than um this idea that we have
an identity and you must come in or you
 
an identity and you must come in or you
don't have to come in I think it's much
 
don't have to come in I think it's much
more around the work the individuals the
 
more around the work the individuals the
relationships what needs to get done and
 
relationships what needs to get done and
what's most appropriate for that do you
 
what's most appropriate for that do you
think that holds for smaller companies
 
think that holds for smaller companies
yeah I do I think in some ways I think
 
yeah I do I think in some ways I think
it's probably I mean you know just take
 
it's probably I mean you know just take
my own company we're a small company
 
my own company we're a small company
there are uh nine of us and we've never
 
there are uh nine of us and we've never
had an office we have somebody who's in
 
had an office we have somebody who's in
the the aisle of orne which is in
 
the the aisle of orne which is in
Scotland which takes you 40 hours to get
 
Scotland which takes you 40 hours to get
to we have somebody in Malaga we have
 
to we have somebody in Malaga we have
people spread around the UK we've never
 
people spread around the UK we've never
had an office but I would say we've got
 
had an office but I would say we've got
a very strong identity I think the
 
a very strong identity I think the
identity comes from the way you make
 
identity comes from the way you make
decisions the way you treat people the
 
decisions the way you treat people the
way you do business um I don't think we
 
way you do business um I don't think we
need an office for that I think that
 
need an office for that I think that
comes through conversation judgment

couple of years lack of trust exactly
yeah I mean I find this this really
 
yeah I mean I find this this really
frustrating I think so much of what HR
 
frustrating I think so much of what HR
does is because we don't trust managers
 
does is because we don't trust managers

engagement um so um I think that HR
spends a lot of time compensating for
 
spends a lot of time compensating for
poor managers and we don't trust them to
 
poor managers and we don't trust them to
manage and so much of what we do with
 
manage and so much of what we do with
employees is because we don't it's not

that we don't trust employees actually

they were looking at how they could
improve the conversation around
 
improve the conversation around
diversity Equity inclusion um because

going to work it's small little tweaks
it is enabling a conversation that
 
it is enabling a conversation that

the talent review with the assumption
 
the talent review with the assumption
that everyone in your team is ready to
 
that everyone in your team is ready to

prepared to talk about everybody so it's
just small things none of which in and
 
just small things none of which in and
of itself is going to tra change things
 
of itself is going to tra change things
dramatically but I do think the answer
 
dramatically but I do think the answer
lies in keeping a conversation going
 
lies in keeping a conversation going
that is open and doesn't alienate people
 
that is open and doesn't alienate people

seeing a
 
seeing a
polarization and for those organizations
 
polarization and for those organizations
who are still very Pro Dei there is the
 
who are still very Pro Dei there is the
risk that a lot of the conversations
 
risk that a lot of the conversations
just go underground and that's not going
 
just go underground and that's not going
