# Bryan Power on Exits, Loyalty, and Why Your Goodbye Matters More Than You Think

## Transcript

 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have Power Hour with Brian Power. What's
up, Brian? Good to see you, bro.
&gt;&gt; Third time at the show. Thank you again
for having me.
&gt;&gt; I just have to say I saw Power Hour on
my calendar invite and I was like, what
the what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I thought it was just
an inside joke and here we are branding
it like Dear Heritage.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is I will I got to take
credit for this one. I'm a I'm a drive
time radio guy and so like you got to
have like stickicks for the regular
people who come on.
&gt;&gt; Power hour. Let's go.
&gt;&gt; You guys, the last time I was on, we did
Kelly's least favorite corporate lingo
and you said it was going to be a thing.
And I don't think you ever did it again.
So, we have to bring it back to make it
a go.
&gt;&gt; We should do it. Let's close today with
another another lingo.
&gt;&gt; Great. Exhilarating. All right, Brian,
you are now unemployed. Congratulations.
&gt;&gt; Unemployed. Thank you. [clears throat]
And as part of your unemployment,
you decided to write the diet tribe on
how to quit, which has gotten like it's
all over my LinkedIn. Interestingly
enough, I'm working on a search right
now talking to a finalist candidate and
was like, "Hey, like you know, he's
thinking about how to transition out of
his company." And I was like, "Oh, let
me send you this thing." So, I've
already seen it. It's everywhere. So,
you are now like, you know, the the new
Shakespeare. Everyone's seen your stuff.
give us the rundown on the why, like
what drove this article.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's something I've been thinking
about for a while. And I said at the
beginning, like I didn't want to write
it while I was working because I thought
my team would think I'm quitting because
it's about quitting. And that's kind of
weak, but also I just didn't want to
deal with it. But it's always a topic
that I think is not discussed enough,
which is what are some things you should
consider when you quit? And then, you
know, as I've gotten older, I turned 50
this year. I'm really realizing a lot,
particularly of younger employees,
haven't been taught stuff, and they
haven't been able to learn stuff by
working in the office with other people.
This is the type of thing you would pick
up through osmosis of just being able to
chat with people at work, which I think
is one of the downsides of so much
remote work is that just kind of
cross-pollination of how to do things.
And as I've, you know, teed off on
wishing younger people knew how to do
more stuff, I've also come to realize
it's the burden and the responsibility
of people with lots of experience to
share. So I was like, you know what,
instead of complaining about people
leaving the wrong way, I'm just going to
say these are my thoughts. But it was
really just trying to get something off
my chest. I was struck by how many
people commented they had never I don't
want to say been told because that means
they should have heard it from me but
had never seen it written down you know
so that was validating in taking the
time to do it you know the point of the
article is you can really screw up your
time at a company with very little time
left at a time when you think you've
actually put pencils down and then
inversely is maybe less common I've seen
people who just got crushed by the
company fired for performance, clearly
not working out. And the way they manage
themselves in the last two weeks changes
that entire reputation to where people
are going out of their way to really
help you find your next thing because
you're just such a pro. And again,
you're in the people space. You have a
front row seat to this type of stuff.
But it's just so important because the
pain you witness when people screw this
up unnecessarily is real.
&gt;&gt; That was my story. Like I I told you,
Brian, when you wrote this, like my
response back to you in my comment on
LinkedIn was like, I wish somebody had
given this to me 10 years ago. And it
turns out it's not it's not an intrinsic
thing. Like you need to actually watch
other people do it. You need to see
mistakes. You need to see it done super
well in order for you to do it well. And
I'm so happy you wrote this down. Like a
couple things. I had like a ton of
highlights in this thing, but the like
in your first paragraph you say no one
teaches employees how to leave their
company and it's so true and you need to
be taught like you're not going to just
get it right the first time having
flying completely blind on the thing.
The other thing that you said really
early in it is you said your exit often
becomes the entire story of your time at
a company because it's the last thing
people remember.
&gt;&gt; It's the last impression.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, Kelly, we've talked about
this a little bit in the past, but like
this is uh it's it's hard to get right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I love the article, Brian.
Like, no wonder this is power hour.
Like, this was a power article. And the
question I have, um, you know, we can
talk about the reasons why your points
are all very salient and appropriate and
like why do you all think this is not
more widespread? I'd love to diagnose
like what happened here. of two ideas
and I think again part of it for me is
as you mentioned in the beginning I just
left next door after seven years and I
focused so much on the transition more
than I ever have at any company before
and so that also I think was a
motivation to write this I had a great
exit and transition I felt really good
about handing things over like the
timing that's just like not that common
I get sometimes people have a new job
they are going to and the timing of
responsibilities being handed is murky.
Everyone's motivations change. Like, I'm
going to rethink this. Companies should
spend time on how to leave the company
they're running because it's going to be
different strokes depending on where you
are. We talk all day about the way you
should do certain things at the company.
It's a really important moment. Even
just kind of playing the handoff, you
know. The second point is I think people
once they quit is like both sides become
selfish.
if you're not being thoughtful about it.
So the boss is like, "Are you kidding
me? I have to deal with all this stuff
now. Like, do you know what my freaking
wig looked like and now I have to deal
with this, too?" So there's like
potentially resentment and the other
person's like, "Hey, I got to go. You
know, I'm out of here. I'm not doing
anything else." And that just changes
the dynamic and introduces so much risk.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I think that, you know, if I zoom out a
little bit, like, by the way, which is
also a terrible corporate lingo, zoom
out, and I just said it, so I'm just
gonna, it's not my answer later, but
it's one of them. But if I zoom out a
little bit, I feel like we're evolving
to making this stuff less taboo.
remember, you know, years ago when it
was you're at this company and you want
to present the you're in forever, like
I'm going to be here for 20 years and
I'm gonna and then the books came out
where it was, you know, tours of duty
and these like rotational concepts that
it's okay and you should be a great
company to be at and mo more importantly
a great company to be from. And like the
past five years, I talked about that
very openly. Like we want to be an
amazing company to be from and all these
leaders go off and do great things.
Great. And now I think what you've
unleashed here because I don't do it
here at Supio and I literally like I'm
toying do I put it in the onboarding
sessions? Probably not. But there is
whether you talk about under career
pathing or growth or development or
learning there is something to be said
about like when you probably leave here.
here's how to think about doing that. I
love that evolution.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, as I thought about it,
like all the pain between a manager and
employee is on expectations that are
off. Manager think the person's doing
one thing, the person thinks they're
supposed to be something else. And in
this situation in particular, they're
really divergent, you know, and it's
everything from the person's like, "Hey,
I'm going to do the right thing here,
but like I got to go and I want to get
out of here." So, like minimum. And the
manager's like, "Hey, you got to hang on
and keep doing everything until I'm
actually ready." And it also is a bit
adversarial now because the incentives
and loyalties have just been disrupted.
And yeah, to your point, Kelly, this is
what I've thought of is you just say,
"Hey, let's just kind of set this up at
the beginning here that when you leave,
this is kind of what we think the right
baseline is." And then you work around
that versus this total improvis
improvisation on everybody's part
otherwise.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but Kelly, you nailed it, right?
Like the expectation mostly is still
when we give you an offer letter, you're
going to work here for the rest of your
life. Like that is what companies want.
That is truly what people want. And so
when you think about the dynamics
involved with that, it's complicated.
Companies don't want you to leave. They
expect you to be loyal. And so there's
kind of this like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to like break somebody's
heart here and they're not ready for
this. It's like the thing we never talk
about that goes underneath the rug that
just fers over time and then I surprise
people with it and it's like this big
weird, you know, life event thing versus
to your point, I do think it's
modernizing. Brex just had this amazing
recruiting ad around like wanting
quitters. Yeah. So Joel and Heather
nailed it. They just absolutely nailed
it. And it's about launchpad. It's like,
you know, to your point about places
that you want to be from, but I do think
it's a lot of this is loyalty based and
companies still expect loyalty and if
you expect loyalty, then you can never
talk about this thing because it's not
loyal.
&gt;&gt; I think you're completely right that
it's not just like, yay, let's all just
go talk about quitting tomorrow. That's
not what this is. It still is very
complicated and there's emotions and all
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that goes along with that. But
I think this is kind of our job in these
companies. like I'm doing it here to
make things that are under the table or
this or that bring it out on the table
in the right way at the right time with
the you know what I mean with the right
staging but this is stuff that we can
this is like the value in creating these
modern companies where people do feel
motivated and safe and excited about the
present and the future like we can
actually shape this stuff and I think
that's something that shows up in how we
work too it's like if you have a company
where you don't ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk about
single points of failure or when this
person leaves. Not like if this person
quits. No, when this person leaves one
way or another, what happens? Are we
spending time talking about that? So,
there are ways you can kind of do this
where you can bring it out in the open.
But look at this whole AI like frenzy.
Like our two-year average tenure is now
like 14 months, I think. So, I'm like
wild. It's crazy. It's
&gt;&gt; you're fools not to, I think. And if you
don't, I think you'll be caught more on
your heels than otherwise going forward.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was trying to I was trying to
think of like where could you just
steal, you know, templates to do this?
You know, your point, Kelly, you're like
in motiva. How could I do something like
 
running? And, you know, when you rent an
apartment, the terms of like handing the
apartment back is in the lease.
You know, it's like you got to restore
the paint to the original color and
anything on the wall you got to put.
It's like some very basic standards. And
I'm like, you could totally do something
like that in an offer letter. You're
like, look, whatever you quit, you could
quit in six months, you could quit in
six years, but these are kind of like
our base level expectations on how
you're going to handle it. And it'd be
better than it'd be better than nothing,
you know, cuz to your point, Nolan, like
it's Nolan, you're right, like the
assumption is this is the last offer
you're ever going to accept in your
career, you know, working for us
forever. And it's not true. You know,
you're probably going to leave at some
point.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But you're blowing up the ego of
the founder there. A lot of this is just
like the founder the founder cannot
&gt;&gt; accept that reality
&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt; and and they have to have and this is
where honestly Brian you doing this I
think this is going to go around the
founder circle and make people realize
like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like yeah like these people
aren't going to be working here for
forever and so I actually think like
that's helpful.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do think the whole nature of
what it means to have a job is just
changing so much. It's always been
changing but it's very turbulent in the
last five years. Work from home changed
it so much and AI is changing and more.
layoffs changes so much, you know, and
the fact the company every company has
discussions every six months at least on
moving on for some people at the company
and it's fine that that's happening. But
then when it's reciprocated, you know,
to your point, Nolan, it's like, wait,
you're going to quit? Like this is
disloyal, you know? How dare how dare
you? How dare you no longer believe, you
know? So, I don't know. I think there's
some right sizing.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. Metav is the
AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metav's suite of AI agents works for you
at every stage of the hiring process.
Their platform powers instant job postc
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metav changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
MeteView covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to

be up running and AI enabled in minutes.
Yeah, you said something in the article,
Brian, that you know that I think
connected to a hot take I had a while
ago that managers shouldn't find out
during the resignation conversation how
someone has been feeling.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And this is kind of remember when
I went a little bit a little bit wild
Nolan on exit interviews and I was like
if we find out what what's been going on
with the undercurrents like during the
person's last hour when HR people do
exit interviews that is a problem. It's
kind of reminded me of that because if
you can create these cultures and
connect with people and kind of assess
and diagnose and create, you know, at
least safe spaces of not one pocket of
like getting you can, you know, these
things even before someone resigns and
it may not even be about that person,
but it's themes about the culture and
the team and those undercurrents. So, I
just kind of chuckled when I read that
because I was like, yes, same thing for
freaking exit interviews.
One thing that surprised me, so
obviously got a a lot of public
comments, a lot of love, really feeling
validated.
All of the sidebar was about the
discussion about be open and start with
your boss if people were like really
&gt;&gt; couldn't do couldn't have done that.
&gt;&gt; Like my boss was a freaking disaster.
That just would not have worked. And
like my boss I had no support from them
and like I know what you're saying ass
seemed good intent, but I clearly was
not being reciprocated that my manager
was looking out for me. So, I needed to
put like my shield up and get out of
there. And I could not get into I
totally understand this where this
position where you tell your boss you're
leaving and they go to war against you
because you've now made their job more
difficult and now they're vindictive and
you've got to get out of the building
because they're going to make this whole
story about how you were going to get
fired anyway. And like I was shocked at
the text I got. Maybe sad because I I
tried to say I think this is the right
way to do it. But that's such a valid
set of cases that manager capability on
this, which is what you're talking
about, Kelly. It's like when you find
out in the exit interview, you're like,
come on.
&gt;&gt; It's my last I'll shut up after this,
but I wrote this down before we started.
We don't do preps. We just we just go
this is why people love this. Um, but I
wrote down because we talk a lot about
how employees should leave a company and
like, you know, and all the things they
can do wrong and the industries are
small and I agree with all that. We
don't nearly talk about how managers
also [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up. And it says so much
about you as a leader how you respond
and react to that news. And believe me,
if you're doing that stuff, Brian, like
no one's going to no one's going to work
for you, follow you anywhere. And that's
one of the first things I look for in
leaders that we hire is who will follow
you? What kind of leader are you? and
come across a ton of them. Like that's
the old Seinfeld like that's a shame.
&gt;&gt; But on the loyalty piece, you don't get
points as a manager when a good person
leaves at most companies, right? And so
it's so much easier to just be like,
"Oh, like they they were shitty anyways.
Like we can replace them, right?"
Because they're covering what the
company thinks is the original sin,
which is letting go. Like you didn't
hold on to the great person. Why aren't
they going to be here for forever? And
so managers have to go into CIA mode.
That's what like that's the thing
underneath the thing is it's all about
company loyalty at the end of the day.
And this employment contract is being
rewritten in real time. We just haven't
had enough cycles through it for a
manager to be like, "Yeah, like it's
better for them, Mr. CEO, Mr. or Mrs.
CEO. Like this is the right thing for
them."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a lot of nuance underneath
that though, Nolan. You know what I
mean? Like scenario A is
you know, A+ star employee um that's
been there eight months and the manager
is a total disaster and like a total
loser and they have to leave because
that person's terrible. Scenario two is
I mean I've had this someone's been with
you for over two years, three years,
they're growing, they're kicking ass,
and they get a number one opportunity.
and the culture and the programs and the
philosophies are set up such that I've
been talking about this at leadership
calibration for the last eight months
like hey this person is like on it like
I'm planning for the back fill because
they're probably get a sale and their
wings are points
&gt;&gt; yeah I to totally agree with you Kelly
like you're exactly right I still think
it's not safe at most companies for
managers to say things like they've
reached their terminal ceiling here for,
you know, whatever reason.
&gt;&gt; I think it is best for them to leave.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like it's not a safe thing to say.
&gt;&gt; That that is our job to help turn that.
If you can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] leave,
&gt;&gt; leave. And I think I think there again
feeling my age. There's some immaturity
that happens when someone good quits
that there's like this insecurity about
well they can't be that good otherwise
they wouldn't be leaving or like what
does it say someone's leaving we can't
let that get out because that might
change the story. It's like really too
much. It's like people it's a great
thing to work with great people whether
it's for two years or five years or
longer. It's actually really bad to work
at a place where no one ever leaves you
know gets really calcified. new people
coming in and picking up the flag and
running downfield is a great thing and
you got to create some movement. So like
mass attrition all the time isn't really
what I'm saying, but like we can just
calm down if someone did a good job for
a couple years and decides they want to
try something else with their career
that we don't need to have this whole
narrative about what it means about the
company or the individual that is now
totally changed by the fact that they
are moving in a different direction.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you guys want to know something
funny? I I do this at every I've done it
at every company the last 10 years is
when I start to that exact point, Brian,
of oh, they're great. Oh, they resigned.
Well, they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You know, I I I
asked for the attrition list as far back
as it goes. And every unregrettable
termination I like dig into. I'm like,
&gt;&gt; tell me about tell me tell me about
this. And I swear like 30% of them get
overturned.
&gt;&gt; 30? That's low. I mean I we at one point
I can't remember is it next door before
like I wouldn't let the manager answer
the question
&gt;&gt; or if they answered it I couldn't let
them answer for six months
&gt;&gt; because regrettable was really like now
I have all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do you know and
I regret I regret that [laughter] you
know and [clears throat] then the story
change it's just not a good time to ask
at the moment of transition is this a
good or a bad idea for the company
itself just give it some time and you
get to a better better discussion
&gt;&gt; that's that's such an interesting
insight Okay. So, there there was a lot
around
&gt;&gt; like your reputation uh you know being
made after you announced like I that's I
think that stuff like is so true. A lot
of big learnings in my career. The
really I think interesting one that flew
under the radar is the no long goodbyes
and you told this story. I'm going to
read this paragraph because it's so
good. You said the best advice on timing
that I ever got came when I transitioned
out of my first manager role. I was
distraught about what my team would do
without me and thought I should stay for
weeks if not months. The HRBP that I
shared an office with looked at me dead
in the eye and said, "Let's say you're
literally the best manager in the world
and I'm being kind by starting with
that. Then they might still be thinking
about this on Friday. It was Tuesday. By
Monday, they'll be fine." That is the
truest thing, right? is like what no
matter what the moment is it's like oh
my god it's crazy when the announcement
happens three days later everyone's
moved on it doesn't matter who you are
&gt;&gt; it's true that could be really tough I
mean I'll never forget that it's one of
the best tough love comments I've ever
got from a teammate it I mean it hit
like a hammer but it was it it was
clearly so true you know and I was just
like whining too much but the truth is
when you feel that people move on. It's
It's very risky for you because you're
like, "Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. I
thought like, you know, yesterday you're
really upset. Like, how come you're not
still upset? Like, I haven't left yet."
You know, and people are kind like it it
does there's there's a little bit of
people are now moving into the new
reality. It's not like a showing their
true colors thing. It's now like you're
not on the team. They got to figure that
out as quickly as they can. And don't
you shouldn't I don't think you should
judge people when they move on to their
new reality quickly because it's just
kind of your own ego or being selfish to
want it to be drawn out. And this is why
I think when people stick around for too
long, here's what I think happens.
People give notice and the manager's
like, "No way. I'm not ready for this.
You got to give me more time, a minimum
of a month, at least two months." But
they're really like trying to create the
space to figure out what to do. And
every time I've seen this, once you
solve that problem of, okay, now we need
to know what to do, which can be like a
week, the other person should just
really move out as quickly as possible
because there's there's only downside
risk now. Downside for the person who's
trying to sit in the chair, downside for
this person to basically light
themselves on fire on the way out the
door. But it's not about like how much
time they gave. It's about what needs to
actually happen. you know,
&gt;&gt; what is the best thing you all would if
you're in in the audience and you're
planning on resigning, right, versus
accepting a resignation or as managers,
what is the best thing that someone can
do for you when they resign?
&gt;&gt; The number one thing now, I literally
use this today with that candidate who I
referenced earlier is you take Brian's
article and you give it to the manager
and you say like, "Hey, I found this
resource. I think this playbook makes a
ton of sense. Can you read it, digest
it, and let me know if you agree to run
this play?
&gt;&gt; I love that. My ad to that is when
someone comes to me and says, "Hey,
it's time. And by the way, I've come up
with like a whole plan of transition
work ideas." I'm like, "Oh my god,
you've built a half bridge that I can
like latch on to." That's incredible.
I think you know people leaders know
this when you need to move on from
somebody there's this entire run of show
how it's going to go down there's a
basically a change management plan when
anyone a leadership change is going to
happen or a reorg
like just because the employee is the
one initiating doesn't mean you don't
need a plan like that and you're right
Kelly when someone's like hey everything
I'm responsible for here's the best
option here's what to do and you're at
least investing in making the transition
to success versus like I quit My last
day is next Friday. Someone else got to
figure it out now. Good luck with that,
you know, which which is going to breed
resentment.
&gt;&gt; Yes. And if you're a manager, just going
about your day like duckies and horses.
No one's ever going to leave. You're
cooked.
&gt;&gt; As my kids would say, you're you're
cooked.
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to say six, seven.
&gt;&gt; It's terrible. I do it every three
weeks. Like I don't think anyone here is
leaving, but I'm like I'm upset. What if
they leave? how my how my thing like
that is how a leader should run their
team.
&gt;&gt; That's great, Kelly. I am surprised
how much of like a great idea that is
that other people don't do because I did
that, too. I'm constantly scenario
planning. Okay, if they leave, who who
do I have today that I can put into that
job? And it's going to be a terrible
battlefield promotion, but at least I'm
starting to work out the playbook of
like what I'm going to do.
&gt;&gt; And you're right, like I'm amazed.
&gt;&gt; Secret selfish. Sorry. Yeah, but I'm
amazed at how many people are just like
assuming no one's ever going to leave
and then they're like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this
person quit and I I'm not ready." And so
I I do think that's another thing where
people leading
&gt;&gt; organizations, you just got to
constantly be running through all the
time what you would do and then it's not
as big of a deal when it happens.
&gt;&gt; Maybe we have to learn it like I I the
reason I do it is because I am I am
traumatized by getting so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around
this. [laughter]
totally
&gt;&gt; like ultra paranoid at all times.
&gt;&gt; So Brian, the part that you didn't cover
was maintaining relationships after you
leave. So maybe this is this is me, but
like literally I remember when I left
Door Dash, who I didn't want to be was
Matthew McConna and Jason Confused
hanging outside the high school. Like
I'd already like I'm out of there, but
like I'm still like hanging out with the
people there.
there is like this I still kind of feel
awkward about that thing and I think
even like maintaining the relationship
like you have to give like some distance
but like you clearly were in the
trenches with these people and so like
the right amount of touch points with
that for me was super awkward. I don't
know if you guys have ever felt that way
in your career but it's like you got to
like give that team space to go do it
but it's also that like goodbye I'm
never talking to you forever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just want to hear from because I
love that.
&gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] All right. All
right.
&gt;&gt; I think um you want to like you
definitely want to be there for people
who may need your help after you left,
but even that you want to make sure they
know it's clear like I'm not here
anymore. You you kind of need to do it.
And so, um that's a tough space to try
to negotiate fair for everybody where
they don't feel like you just totally
dumped it on them, but also like you're
you did move you did move on, you know,
and so they got to they got to figure
out new ways forward. But then the
second thing is just the actual
relationships. Like I think the time
goes by pretty quick, you know, and I
think you can reach back out to whoever
you want to stay in touch with once
you've kind of, you know, the calendar's
turn. And I and I think I regret not
doing that more than doing it too early
because then you're like, I haven't
talked to this person in like years now.
Now it's almost like someone from high
school. It's like it took
&gt;&gt; what the hell is wrong with me? Why
didn't I maintain that? I should have
maintained that thing. Yes. Exactly. But
then I think also but I also think
people like some people are like
connectors, you know, they're the people
who reach out to people they used to
work with over time and people
appreciate when someone does it. You
just got to put it out there. Yep. 100%.
All right, let's let's transition to
some other tech news. So, if you work in
our space in people and talent and
you've been living under a rock, the
biggest news of the last week was that
Growth by Design, uh, which was founded
by Adam, Jill, and Mike, was acquired,
Aquaired. I'm not exactly sure like what
the thing was, but that firm is now no
more. And Mike and Adam, as at least
it's been told to me by friends, are now
working at Cursor. Um, that's like a
pretty dope and huge thing uh that I did
not expect. Brian, what's your take on
that move?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so uh I think Adam those Adam
those guys are the first people I know
at Cursor. So I'm really just a
spectator of the company. They had this
they had this article everyone was
reading about inside Cursor that was in
Colossus magazine that's like a deep
dive of working there. you know, they're
one of the fastest growing uh AI
companies in a space that's growing like
lightning. Like they are definitely a
pace setter. Uh and they're a young
organization that's just doing lots of
things their way clearly. And I have
huge respect for that because especially
in this frothy AI market, a lot of
people are trying to cut and paste their
way to higher valuations. And again,
just for the outside, Cursor seems to be
really cutting their own path. And
buying, you know, getting Growth by
Design off the table and inside was a
jaw-dropper. You know, they Next Door
was a customer of Growth by Design. I've
had tremendous respect for Adam. I've
known all of them, but Adam in
particular is an absolute monster in the
talent space. Like a legend. And they've
helped like hundreds of tech companies.
And you know, the reason they did that
is because like one company wasn't
enough for them. They're going to help
all these companies at once. But that
just is even more impressive for cursor
to be able to convince them to come join
what they're doing. And you know, I was
telling you before, it also is hurtful
to all the people that depended on
growth by design to help grow their
organizations because this now huge
capability is off the market and inside
of a customer of one cursor. So, I was
just that's really impressive. I I think
that is going to be a even more of a net
positive for Cursor, which is already
doing a great job with recruiting uh
great people uh in a fascinating way.
You know, one thing that they talk about
in the article, so I can't validate in
this, is that they kind of brag about
spending a quarter of their time on
recruiting. And so many startups that I
talk to, I talk to the recruiting
leaders and their challenge is they
can't get people at the startup to spend
more time on recruiting. They're like
they want the recruiters to do
everything. And this is like definitely
the common thing. And the companies that
dominate, every person believes it's
personally important to impact getting
more people, great people to join. It's
not like I'm in meetings all week and
I'll forward a email template, an AI
drafted email template to someone with
nine other offers. You know, that's like
the level of effort. So the fact that
Ker already had this huge recruiting
culture and added these like true
legends from talent was caught my
attention. Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; I don't think I have um much to add. I
just to me my first reaction was that's
a really creative move. You know, you're
used to these companies acquiring other,
you know what I mean? Techto tech,
right? other, you know, tools or and and
I thought it was a really interesting
&gt;&gt; um almost like a leaprog kind of like
wow hard right turn and I think it it
turned a lot of people's heads. So, I'm
actually interested to see what this um
starts. You guys know how this industry
is or maybe we should acquire like I I'm
interested to see what what this um
unleashes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So there's one analog that I can
think of which was the bank Robin Hood
Robin Hood acquiring bank uh back in the
day you know famously I I think that
timing was you know there's two parties
in this transaction
&gt;&gt; right there's the there's GBD and then
there's cursor and the bank and Robin
Hood transaction you know you talk to
anybody who is like bank timed it
perfectly like and then the market
crashed and then basically like every
you know all recruiters were getting
laid off at the time. And so like you
know if you're in that business like
that a friend texted exactly this to me
earlier this week. He's like it's always
better to leave a little bit early from
the party than to leave too late.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I thought that was like spot on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's um you know
that's like got the benefit of
hindsight, but I remember that time when
Robin Hood announced that being totally
distraught because bank had dozens of
really good edge recruiters that were
all over the industry and all of a
sudden those on-site contract recruiters
resigned that day and were all going to
Robin Hood which just amped up and
became they just jumped to having it was
something like 40 or 50 engineering
recruiters who were in the flow of all
these pipelines of all these other
companies. So yeah, I mean then the
market flipped like next the week after
that or whatever, but I remember when I
heard that I was like, what am I going
to do? You know, that was such a such a
huge move that to your point, Kelly,
like you talk about it, but not a lot of
companies are willing to make a move at
that that st that scale.
&gt;&gt; There's going to be copycats though,
Kelly, I think you're exactly right. Um,
you know, I'm running talent searches
right now. It's there's very clearly a
need at the top end to where people have
great jobs, they don't want to move or
there's just like not enough people who
are ready for like that next thing. And
if you are a talent leader, there's a
ton of agency involved in building your
own business. And now I think people see
that that you know this GBD hole that's
been left to your point, Brian, like
they've helped hundreds of companies and
now gone. So now all of a sudden that
there's going to be a vacuum there that
needs to get filled which is going to I
think probably accelerate more people
building their own business and then
more companies therefore being like who
do we go for? Like if you're the top end
like cursor super hot, you know, $30
billion valuation, you're like 300
people, who do you call for help now?
Who's going to want to come do that
thing? Because that's not a Google like
nothing against Google, but that's a
 
&gt;&gt; That is a completely different problem
set
&gt;&gt; that I think Adam is so uniquely capable
of solving. So I'm I am fascinated to
see how this thing plays out. I do think
it's like a pretty gangster move from
all parties involved.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um on the on a good note as
well, I mean, we've talked, you know, at
Nauseium about the layoffs and
especially recruiting teams, you know,
and I I really like the upswing this is
going to create, right? The demand's
going to increase for recruiters. A lot
of folks that have been struggling are
going to get back in the game. Like, I
like that momentum.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting. I've always
thought, yeah, I've [snorts] always
thought that recruiter availability is
the best canary on where the market's
headed. And I see more and more
recruiters have jobs now than did
before. Again, it's all anecdotal. I
don't have like the report of what's the
unemployment rate of recruiters. But I
just I've seen a lot of people that had
a tough go in 23 and 24 are working now
and they're also working at good comp.
And like when that changes, you know,
things people have started to make
different decisions, but it's like a
six-month leading indicator. And I just
think right now a lot of the recruiters
are flat out and they're all competing
against each other. And it's a lot. So
everyone talks about like frothy bubble.
You never know when that's going to
stop. It's dumb to try to to call it,
but right now it just feels like the
motor is running. You know, people
people are really competing.
&gt;&gt; I will I will take the other side on
that. So, like right before this
conversation, I was talking to a friend
that's in the consulting. He he does
tech consulting. It's comp consulting.
And one of the things I was asking about
comp and like what what are you saying?
And he goes for every AI company 90th
percentile is the new 50th.
And I go, well, that's that's
interesting cuz like the math doesn't
math on that. If headcounts were what
they were 10 years ago, and clearly
they're not. He's like, they're not.
like headc counts are smaller. If you
look at public tech companies, it's
basically flat
since 2022. And he said, and what he was
really concerned about, he had a number
of examples of where people were like
really getting hurt at the lower and mid
tier. He goes, it's just going to keep
it's going to basically skip lower and
mid tier and keep flowing to the top. So
like the best will continue to acrue a
ton of value. And that value used to
trickle down in the form of like, oh,
there's recruiting coordinator jobs
open, there's sorcerer jobs open. Now
there's like very very few of these jobs
and more people across the company to
Kurser's point everybody should be
involved in recruiting. You should spend
 
thought at Door Dash too. So I'm not
sure it's going to be this like big
trickle down effect. I think it's more
going to be you know value gets really
acred to the top end of the market.
That's my take.
&gt;&gt; I actually don't think we're saying
opposite things. I think what what the
difference here Nolan is the timing is
the timing of things. So I think what I
heard Brian and I saying is compared to
the enterprise SAS just blow up you know
 
this is a uptick up as far as the number
of companies mostly AI there are other
industries but the number of number of
companies back in growth mode that are
like seething to hire talent and get
recruiters is different than it was two
years ago in a in a positive way. Now
over time to your point as AI comes in
or whatnot that might be true but
&gt;&gt; yeah I think it's uh okay my take is uh
clearly entry level role roles have been
hit very hard you know like right now
people have just turned it off I I think
that's a big mistake but it's what
everybody's doing and the reason I think
it's a mistake is the the kids say kids
because I'm my 50s the kids coming out
of college are learning this stuff so
fast that the companies are going to
need this skill set. One of my favorite
takes, I've quoted this a bunch of times
now, um I was at a conference three
weeks ago and this woman was on stage.
She's in charge of AI transformation at
JP Morgan. I forget her name now, but
they have 250,000 employees. And her
take was in three to five years, people
are going to expect when they join a
company that agents do all the manual
work. And the take right now is that
agents are going to replace all those
people. What's really going to happen is
people will know how to manage agents
and build agents to do things. And if
you have not built out that
infrastructure at your company, people
are going to look at you as like an old
company, you know, and I was kind of
like, wow, that's this weird thing. But
it is true. And I I do think though it
is going to take a long time for these
companies to effectively deploy
artificial intelligence in how they do
things. And you see this with just how
much juice there is on people trying to
find deployment people at consulting
companies. all the AI companies like
Enthropic and Open AD, they're all
trying to hire people to go to their
customers and help them figure out how
to do it. And it's not like people like
Kelly and me like I've been trying, but
like we're freaking busy and it doesn't
work out of the box, you know? And so
that means it's not going to happen in
 
and all the jobs go away, but these
people who will be really AI native
skills will be so valuable to help push
that from underneath that I just think
it's gonna come back around.
&gt;&gt; It's like the new era. remember like
digital transformation and all that a
few there's like there's a job like head
of digital transformation and they would
just like get inserted into these
companies to help. It's kind of similar
to that just a
&gt;&gt; It is. But the difference I've been
thinking about this because you're
right, there's always been solutions
engineers and stuff like that, but the
technology they were deploying was
pretty much out of the box. It does this
and you can customize a little bit but
not much where what you can do with AI
and I was so customizable. You really
need someone smart to think about what
you want to build inside of your
company. And again, no one has
experience doing it. It's like two years
&gt;&gt; and none of it gets to the last mile.
None of it goes to the last mile.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. That's the That's the
main thing. Um Ari Emanuel was on the
Invest with the Best podcast which just
launched like yesterday and the day
before. It's so good. It like I I'm
listening to this podcast more and more.
It's a phenomenal. This is the same Ari
from Entourage.
And one of the things that him and
Patrick were talking about on the
episode, which I I I hadn't thought
about, but I totally agree with, is AI,
I think, is disproportionately helping
the best people become even better and
kind of bringing everyone else to this
like median place. And so, Brian, to
your point, I agree with you. Um, I
strongly agree that there's so much
alpha with these new grads if companies
will invest in them. But everybody wants
results today, which goes back to the
comp co comp conversation, which is why
everyone's paying 90th, cuz it's like I
don't want to wait. I don't want to have
a long feedback cycle if I hire somebody
to ROI in their employment. And I think
it's it's very shortsighted. Everyone's
just trying to condense the feedback
cycle to like give me value today and
they're not thinking longer term. Um,
and I think a lot of these companies are
going to get burned by that because
they're going to have a very small bench
and they're going to wish they would
have done that. I've been talking to
recruiters about this for a long time. I
think that's why we have a shortage in
recruiting because we're not investing
in new hiring where there's so much
talent.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, let me take the other side
of that. Just living in one of these
companies, Nolan. Yeah. time is not a
luxury that
a lot of these companies have given the
pace of the competition. Um the pace of
of folks investing in these I mean we
look at at Supio we're like boom Eve
boom another million boom 60 million
like it this is a race and
of course we're trying to kind of calm
it down and go a little bit slower to go
fast but that that is sounds nice. It's
funny because no one always tells me I'm
the I'm the, you know, utopia one.
Sounds nice, but in reality with this
situation, at this exact moment in time,
with this AI thing, it's a little bit
harder practice.
&gt;&gt; I agreed. I think it's like, this is
bite-sized for me. This is not, excuse
me, it's not go hire 30 new grads for a
 
um have them do some sort of like
rotation thing that are just like elite
kids, right? Like there's so much talent
available there that one of the things
we did at Door Dash is we had this
launch team and we we had an intentional
decision to overhire on that team just
slightly so we could have slack that we
could deploy in other areas of the
company that were feeling pinched. You
just get generalists. And the thing with
generalists are going away right now and
I think there's there is still so much
room to be had for like that type of
person. What do you think, Brian?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think on to Kelly's point, the
thing that I've always come back to is
like you're going to hire people with no
experience and they're going to have
like three to five years experience
before you freaking look up. And you're
like, we don't have time to train them,
but that time goes by really fast. And
people with no experience learn really
fast if you do a good job with it. And
they also don't know what they don't
know. So they don't spend three years
telling you to do it the way their last
company did it, which is a ton of
friction you get from experienced
people. But the reality is is to to N's
point, everyone's trying to hire the
people with 10 years of experience.
You're not going to get them. You're not
nearly going to get as nearly as many as
you think. Even if you are a leading
tech company right now, you're not
getting as many as you want because
everyone wants them. And so you you
could easily spend three or four years
like not getting the people you say we
can only hire and you're in the same
spot. And but if you just do both, at
some point these kids become experienced
at your company doing it the way you
think that they should do it. And um the
time goes fast is is definitely what uh
I've seen again and again and again.
&gt;&gt; It does. I Exactly. Time does go fast.
Especially if you're at a winning
company. Like if it's growing super
fast, it's very easy to think short
term, but like you have earned the right
to solve the longer term problem and you
have to be thoughtful about it. Um,
that's my take. Kelly, do you want to do
the uh, what is it? Slogans.
&gt;&gt; Let's go. Brian's squatting at
Crunchyroll and he's going to get kicked
out in about six minutes. So, let's do
the let's do the cringy corporate logo.
Now, remember, when you say the phrase,
you have to use it in a sentence as
well. [snorts]
 
Very important.
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm ready. Do I go first because
I'm the visitor?
&gt;&gt; You could go first, Brian. Yeah, you're
the guest. Yeah, Kelly, you went last
time and I've been thinking about this
since the last time I was on because
this is the one I actually wanted to do
and I thought about it as soon as we
hung up the phone. So, the expression I
can't stand is I don't disagree.
And people say this all the time in
meetings and they say like no one will
give a hot take. I'm like, well Nolan, I
don't disagree with you and I basically
have said nothing. I've said Nolan,
you're in bounds. I've not shown any
support for what you're saying, which
would be like Nolan, I agree with you.
you know, I just say like I don't
disagree and I can actually act like I'm
participating in the meeting on the
team, but I'm doing nothing. I'm staying
neutral. And so many of these companies
suffer because people are just playing
neutral all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and no one
leans in or out on any of the debates.
And the expression, I don't disagree,
symbolizes that terrible behavior that
happens at bigger and bigger companies.
So I really now I just call people out.
When someone says it, I'm like, no, but
do you agree with me? I know you don't
disagree. you would have disagreed, but
do you agree? And people are like, well,
well, wait, wait, wait. Like, do I have
your support in what I just said? And it
like shocks people because it's nice to
say nothing but sound like you said
something good.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; In fact, you agree with me. Is that
right? Like, is that I was wondering you
agree?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you agree? And when people are
like, well, no. And I'm like, okay. So,
so you pretended to agree, but you
didn't say anything. That's mine.
&gt;&gt; So, you pretended to agree.
&gt;&gt; That was good, Brian. I like that. That
was spot on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. One that's been pissing me off
lately that I just think is just such a
dumb I don't necessarily agree with the
concept. I just think it's such a dumb
word and it just
&gt;&gt; elicits just laziness and just pure I
don't even know what that means is I
don't have bandwidth.
 
&gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What are you What are you
talking about? You don't have I don't
have the bandwidth. This is so I have to
say I don't have to say anything else. I
I mean I think [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I've had this conversation so many
times. I actually think it's a signal of
someone who is a new manager or a new
director and it's just not good at
talking about how they need to
prioritize and ret prioritize. It's like
you have plenty of freaking bandwidth.
You could totally do this. You just
don't want to say you're not going to do
something else or you don't want to do
it.
&gt;&gt; Totally. So So you know I will say
something else and then I'll stop. Don't
say I don't have the bandwidth. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
say how important is this? and one does
it need to be get done.
&gt;&gt; 100 odd percent. That's a such a good
&gt;&gt; or or say I'm prioritizing these things
right now.
&gt;&gt; Which would you like me to like do you
want me to not prioritize these and
prioritize something else?
&gt;&gt; That's the followup on look I I get it.
How important is this? When does it have
to get done? Here's the deal. What do we
want to do? I'll figure it out. But
great.
The one that's been the one that's been
driving me crazy is like I'll circle
back without any deadline.
Like no no no deadline. It's it's
basically filler to say like yeah like
let's just kind of end this conversation
while while the the car just keeps
going. It's like I've stepped out of the
vehicle. I'm no longer driving. The car
keeps going [laughter] and this vehicle
is no longer in my possession.
&gt;&gt; Um that's good. And right now, and right
now you get the right now you get the
holiday version, which is let's circle
back after the holidays. You know, it's
just like completely like see you in
January. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Let's circle back after the holiday. You
know what?
&gt;&gt; You know what I love? Let's I I love
Let's circle back. You know what it also
does? It's such like it's such a lame
way just to silence everyone. Like do
you guys hear? But whenever I hear like
there's six people around table, let's
circle back on that.
&gt;&gt; No one says anything. It kills the whole
thing. Totally. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Because it's a euphemism for this is
never going to get discussed again,
&gt;&gt; right? Let's send this into outer space.
I agree. These are those are good,
&gt;&gt; dude. I love I'm like tearing up
laughing. I want a t-shirt that says,
"Let's circle back."
&gt;&gt; Oh, God.
&gt;&gt; Uh Brian, good to see you, brother. Uh
we I think we have to have you back on
like every couple weeks now. So, just to
&gt;&gt; that. Well, you named it Power Hour, so
you know. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for having me.
&gt;&gt; See you.
