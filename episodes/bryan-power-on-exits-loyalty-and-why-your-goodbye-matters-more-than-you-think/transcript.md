And as part of your unemployment,
you decided to write the diet tribe on
 
you decided to write the diet tribe on
how to quit, which has gotten like it's
 
how to quit, which has gotten like it's
all over my LinkedIn. Interestingly
 
all over my LinkedIn. Interestingly
enough, I'm working on a search right
 
enough, I'm working on a search right
now talking to a finalist candidate and
 
now talking to a finalist candidate and
was like, "Hey, like you know, he's
 
was like, "Hey, like you know, he's
thinking about how to transition out of
 
thinking about how to transition out of
his company." And I was like, "Oh, let
 
his company." And I was like, "Oh, let

already seen it. It's everywhere. So,
 
already seen it. It's everywhere. So,
you are now like, you know, the the new
 
you are now like, you know, the the new
Shakespeare. Everyone's seen your stuff.
 
Shakespeare. Everyone's seen your stuff.
give us the rundown on the why, like
 
give us the rundown on the why, like
what drove this article.
 
what drove this article.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's something I've been thinking
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's something I've been thinking
about for a while. And I said at the
 
about for a while. And I said at the
beginning, like I didn't want to write
 
beginning, like I didn't want to write
it while I was working because I thought
 
it while I was working because I thought
my team would think I'm quitting because
 
my team would think I'm quitting because
it's about quitting. And that's kind of
 
it's about quitting. And that's kind of
weak, but also I just didn't want to
 
weak, but also I just didn't want to
deal with it. But it's always a topic
 
deal with it. But it's always a topic
that I think is not discussed enough,
 
that I think is not discussed enough,
which is what are some things you should
 
which is what are some things you should
consider when you quit? And then, you
 
consider when you quit? And then, you
know, as I've gotten older, I turned 50
 
know, as I've gotten older, I turned 50
this year. I'm really realizing a lot,
 
this year. I'm really realizing a lot,
particularly of younger employees,
 
particularly of younger employees,
haven't been taught stuff, and they
 
haven't been taught stuff, and they
haven't been able to learn stuff by
 
haven't been able to learn stuff by
working in the office with other people.
 
working in the office with other people.
This is the type of thing you would pick
 
This is the type of thing you would pick
up through osmosis of just being able to
 
up through osmosis of just being able to
chat with people at work, which I think
 
chat with people at work, which I think
is one of the downsides of so much
 
is one of the downsides of so much
remote work is that just kind of
 
remote work is that just kind of
cross-pollination of how to do things.
 
cross-pollination of how to do things.
And as I've, you know, teed off on
 
And as I've, you know, teed off on
wishing younger people knew how to do
 
wishing younger people knew how to do
more stuff, I've also come to realize
 
more stuff, I've also come to realize
it's the burden and the responsibility
 
it's the burden and the responsibility
of people with lots of experience to
 
of people with lots of experience to
share. So I was like, you know what,
 
share. So I was like, you know what,
instead of complaining about people
 
instead of complaining about people
leaving the wrong way, I'm just going to
 
leaving the wrong way, I'm just going to
say these are my thoughts. But it was
 
say these are my thoughts. But it was
really just trying to get something off
 
really just trying to get something off
my chest. I was struck by how many
 
my chest. I was struck by how many
people commented they had never I don't
 
people commented they had never I don't
want to say been told because that means
 
want to say been told because that means
they should have heard it from me but
 
they should have heard it from me but
had never seen it written down you know
 
had never seen it written down you know
so that was validating in taking the
 
so that was validating in taking the
time to do it you know the point of the
 
time to do it you know the point of the
article is you can really screw up your
 
article is you can really screw up your
time at a company with very little time
 
time at a company with very little time
left at a time when you think you've
 
left at a time when you think you've
actually put pencils down and then
 
actually put pencils down and then
inversely is maybe less common I've seen
 
inversely is maybe less common I've seen
people who just got crushed by the
 
people who just got crushed by the
company fired for performance, clearly
 
company fired for performance, clearly
not working out. And the way they manage
 
not working out. And the way they manage
themselves in the last two weeks changes
 
themselves in the last two weeks changes
that entire reputation to where people
 
that entire reputation to where people
are going out of their way to really
 
are going out of their way to really
help you find your next thing because
 
help you find your next thing because
you're just such a pro. And again,
 
you're just such a pro. And again,
you're in the people space. You have a
 
you're in the people space. You have a
front row seat to this type of stuff.
 
front row seat to this type of stuff.
But it's just so important because the
 
But it's just so important because the
pain you witness when people screw this
 
pain you witness when people screw this
up unnecessarily is real.
 
up unnecessarily is real.
&gt;&gt; That was my story. Like I I told you,
 
&gt;&gt; That was my story. Like I I told you,
Brian, when you wrote this, like my
 
Brian, when you wrote this, like my
response back to you in my comment on
 
response back to you in my comment on
LinkedIn was like, I wish somebody had
 
LinkedIn was like, I wish somebody had
given this to me 10 years ago. And it
 
given this to me 10 years ago. And it
turns out it's not it's not an intrinsic
 
turns out it's not it's not an intrinsic
thing. Like you need to actually watch
 
thing. Like you need to actually watch
other people do it. You need to see
 
other people do it. You need to see
mistakes. You need to see it done super
 
mistakes. You need to see it done super
well in order for you to do it well. And
 
well in order for you to do it well. And
I'm so happy you wrote this down. Like a
 
I'm so happy you wrote this down. Like a
couple things. I had like a ton of
 
couple things. I had like a ton of
highlights in this thing, but the like
 
highlights in this thing, but the like
in your first paragraph you say no one
 
in your first paragraph you say no one
teaches employees how to leave their
 
teaches employees how to leave their
company and it's so true and you need to
 
company and it's so true and you need to
be taught like you're not going to just
 
be taught like you're not going to just
get it right the first time having
 
get it right the first time having
flying completely blind on the thing.
 
flying completely blind on the thing.
The other thing that you said really
 
The other thing that you said really
early in it is you said your exit often
 
early in it is you said your exit often
becomes the entire story of your time at
 
becomes the entire story of your time at
a company because it's the last thing
 
a company because it's the last thing
people remember.
 
people remember.
&gt;&gt; It's the last impression.
 
&gt;&gt; It's the last impression.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, Kelly, we've talked about
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, Kelly, we've talked about
this a little bit in the past, but like
 
this a little bit in the past, but like
this is uh it's it's hard to get right.
 
this is uh it's it's hard to get right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I love the article, Brian.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I love the article, Brian.
Like, no wonder this is power hour.
 
Like, no wonder this is power hour.
Like, this was a power article. And the
 
Like, this was a power article. And the
question I have, um, you know, we can
 
question I have, um, you know, we can
talk about the reasons why your points
 
talk about the reasons why your points
are all very salient and appropriate and
 
are all very salient and appropriate and
like why do you all think this is not
 
like why do you all think this is not
more widespread? I'd love to diagnose
 
more widespread? I'd love to diagnose
like what happened here. of two ideas
 
like what happened here. of two ideas
and I think again part of it for me is
 
and I think again part of it for me is
as you mentioned in the beginning I just
 
as you mentioned in the beginning I just
left next door after seven years and I
 
left next door after seven years and I
focused so much on the transition more
 
focused so much on the transition more
than I ever have at any company before
 
than I ever have at any company before
and so that also I think was a
 
and so that also I think was a
motivation to write this I had a great
 
motivation to write this I had a great
exit and transition I felt really good
 
exit and transition I felt really good
about handing things over like the
 
about handing things over like the
timing that's just like not that common
 
timing that's just like not that common
I get sometimes people have a new job
 
I get sometimes people have a new job
they are going to and the timing of
 
they are going to and the timing of
responsibilities being handed is murky.
 
responsibilities being handed is murky.
Everyone's motivations change. Like, I'm
 
Everyone's motivations change. Like, I'm
going to rethink this. Companies should
 
going to rethink this. Companies should
spend time on how to leave the company
 
spend time on how to leave the company
they're running because it's going to be
 
they're running because it's going to be
different strokes depending on where you
 
different strokes depending on where you
are. We talk all day about the way you
 
are. We talk all day about the way you
should do certain things at the company.
 
should do certain things at the company.
It's a really important moment. Even
 
It's a really important moment. Even
just kind of playing the handoff, you
 
just kind of playing the handoff, you
know. The second point is I think people
 
know. The second point is I think people
once they quit is like both sides become
 
once they quit is like both sides become
selfish.
 
selfish.
if you're not being thoughtful about it.
 
if you're not being thoughtful about it.
So the boss is like, "Are you kidding
 
So the boss is like, "Are you kidding
me? I have to deal with all this stuff
 
me? I have to deal with all this stuff
now. Like, do you know what my freaking
 
now. Like, do you know what my freaking
wig looked like and now I have to deal
 
wig looked like and now I have to deal
with this, too?" So there's like
 
with this, too?" So there's like
potentially resentment and the other
 
potentially resentment and the other
person's like, "Hey, I got to go. You
 
person's like, "Hey, I got to go. You
know, I'm out of here. I'm not doing
 
know, I'm out of here. I'm not doing
anything else." And that just changes
 
anything else." And that just changes
the dynamic and introduces so much risk.
 
the dynamic and introduces so much risk.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I think that, you know, if I zoom out a
 
I think that, you know, if I zoom out a
little bit, like, by the way, which is
 
little bit, like, by the way, which is
also a terrible corporate lingo, zoom
 
also a terrible corporate lingo, zoom
out, and I just said it, so I'm just
 
out, and I just said it, so I'm just
gonna, it's not my answer later, but
 
gonna, it's not my answer later, but
it's one of them. But if I zoom out a
 
it's one of them. But if I zoom out a
little bit, I feel like we're evolving
 
little bit, I feel like we're evolving
to making this stuff less taboo.
 
to making this stuff less taboo.
remember, you know, years ago when it
 
remember, you know, years ago when it
was you're at this company and you want
 
was you're at this company and you want
to present the you're in forever, like
 
to present the you're in forever, like
I'm going to be here for 20 years and
 
I'm going to be here for 20 years and
I'm gonna and then the books came out
 
I'm gonna and then the books came out
where it was, you know, tours of duty
 
where it was, you know, tours of duty
and these like rotational concepts that
 
and these like rotational concepts that
it's okay and you should be a great
 
it's okay and you should be a great
company to be at and mo more importantly
 
company to be at and mo more importantly
a great company to be from. And like the
 
a great company to be from. And like the
past five years, I talked about that
 
past five years, I talked about that
very openly. Like we want to be an
 
very openly. Like we want to be an
amazing company to be from and all these
 
amazing company to be from and all these
leaders go off and do great things.
 
leaders go off and do great things.
Great. And now I think what you've
 
Great. And now I think what you've
unleashed here because I don't do it
 
unleashed here because I don't do it
here at Supio and I literally like I'm
 
here at Supio and I literally like I'm
toying do I put it in the onboarding
 
toying do I put it in the onboarding
sessions? Probably not. But there is
 
sessions? Probably not. But there is
whether you talk about under career
 
whether you talk about under career
pathing or growth or development or
 
pathing or growth or development or
learning there is something to be said
 
learning there is something to be said
about like when you probably leave here.
 
about like when you probably leave here.
here's how to think about doing that. I
 
here's how to think about doing that. I
love that evolution.
 
love that evolution.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, as I thought about it,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, as I thought about it,
like all the pain between a manager and
 
like all the pain between a manager and
employee is on expectations that are
 
employee is on expectations that are
off. Manager think the person's doing
 
off. Manager think the person's doing
one thing, the person thinks they're
 
one thing, the person thinks they're
supposed to be something else. And in
 
supposed to be something else. And in
this situation in particular, they're
 
this situation in particular, they're
really divergent, you know, and it's
 
really divergent, you know, and it's
everything from the person's like, "Hey,
 
everything from the person's like, "Hey,
I'm going to do the right thing here,
 
I'm going to do the right thing here,
but like I got to go and I want to get
 
but like I got to go and I want to get
out of here." So, like minimum. And the
 
out of here." So, like minimum. And the
manager's like, "Hey, you got to hang on
 
manager's like, "Hey, you got to hang on
and keep doing everything until I'm
 
and keep doing everything until I'm
actually ready." And it also is a bit
 
actually ready." And it also is a bit
adversarial now because the incentives
 
adversarial now because the incentives
and loyalties have just been disrupted.
 
and loyalties have just been disrupted.
And yeah, to your point, Kelly, this is
 
And yeah, to your point, Kelly, this is
what I've thought of is you just say,
 
what I've thought of is you just say,
"Hey, let's just kind of set this up at
 
"Hey, let's just kind of set this up at
the beginning here that when you leave,
 
the beginning here that when you leave,
this is kind of what we think the right
 
this is kind of what we think the right
baseline is." And then you work around
 
baseline is." And then you work around
that versus this total improvis
 
that versus this total improvis
improvisation on everybody's part
 
improvisation on everybody's part
otherwise.
 
otherwise.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but Kelly, you nailed it, right?
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but Kelly, you nailed it, right?
Like the expectation mostly is still
 
Like the expectation mostly is still
when we give you an offer letter, you're
 
when we give you an offer letter, you're
going to work here for the rest of your
 
going to work here for the rest of your
life. Like that is what companies want.
 
life. Like that is what companies want.
That is truly what people want. And so
 
That is truly what people want. And so
when you think about the dynamics
 
when you think about the dynamics
involved with that, it's complicated.
 
involved with that, it's complicated.
Companies don't want you to leave. They
 
Companies don't want you to leave. They
expect you to be loyal. And so there's
 
expect you to be loyal. And so there's
kind of this like
 
kind of this like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to like break somebody's
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to like break somebody's
heart here and they're not ready for
 
heart here and they're not ready for
this. It's like the thing we never talk
 
this. It's like the thing we never talk
about that goes underneath the rug that
 
about that goes underneath the rug that
just fers over time and then I surprise
 
just fers over time and then I surprise
people with it and it's like this big
 
people with it and it's like this big
weird, you know, life event thing versus
 
weird, you know, life event thing versus
to your point, I do think it's
 
to your point, I do think it's
modernizing. Brex just had this amazing
 
modernizing. Brex just had this amazing
recruiting ad around like wanting
 
recruiting ad around like wanting
quitters. Yeah. So Joel and Heather
 
quitters. Yeah. So Joel and Heather
nailed it. They just absolutely nailed
 
nailed it. They just absolutely nailed
it. And it's about launchpad. It's like,
 
it. And it's about launchpad. It's like,
you know, to your point about places
 
you know, to your point about places
that you want to be from, but I do think
 
that you want to be from, but I do think
it's a lot of this is loyalty based and
 
it's a lot of this is loyalty based and
companies still expect loyalty and if
 
companies still expect loyalty and if
you expect loyalty, then you can never
 
you expect loyalty, then you can never
talk about this thing because it's not
 
talk about this thing because it's not
loyal.
 
loyal.
&gt;&gt; I think you're completely right that
 
&gt;&gt; I think you're completely right that
it's not just like, yay, let's all just
 
it's not just like, yay, let's all just
go talk about quitting tomorrow. That's
 
go talk about quitting tomorrow. That's
not what this is. It still is very
 
not what this is. It still is very
complicated and there's emotions and all
 
complicated and there's emotions and all
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that goes along with that. But
 
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that goes along with that. But
I think this is kind of our job in these
 
I think this is kind of our job in these
companies. like I'm doing it here to
 
companies. like I'm doing it here to
make things that are under the table or
 
make things that are under the table or
this or that bring it out on the table
 
this or that bring it out on the table
in the right way at the right time with
 
in the right way at the right time with
the you know what I mean with the right
 
the you know what I mean with the right
staging but this is stuff that we can
 
staging but this is stuff that we can
this is like the value in creating these
 
this is like the value in creating these
modern companies where people do feel
 
modern companies where people do feel
motivated and safe and excited about the
 
motivated and safe and excited about the
present and the future like we can
 
present and the future like we can
actually shape this stuff and I think
 
actually shape this stuff and I think
that's something that shows up in how we
 
that's something that shows up in how we
work too it's like if you have a company
 
work too it's like if you have a company
where you don't ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk about
 
where you don't ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk about
single points of failure or when this
 
single points of failure or when this
person leaves. Not like if this person
 
person leaves. Not like if this person
quits. No, when this person leaves one
 
quits. No, when this person leaves one
way or another, what happens? Are we
 
way or another, what happens? Are we
spending time talking about that? So,
 
spending time talking about that? So,
there are ways you can kind of do this
 
there are ways you can kind of do this
where you can bring it out in the open.
 
where you can bring it out in the open.
But look at this whole AI like frenzy.
 
But look at this whole AI like frenzy.
Like our two-year average tenure is now
 
Like our two-year average tenure is now
like 14 months, I think. So, I'm like
 
like 14 months, I think. So, I'm like
wild. It's crazy. It's
 
wild. It's crazy. It's
&gt;&gt; you're fools not to, I think. And if you
 
&gt;&gt; you're fools not to, I think. And if you
don't, I think you'll be caught more on
 
don't, I think you'll be caught more on
your heels than otherwise going forward.
 
your heels than otherwise going forward.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was trying to I was trying to
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was trying to I was trying to
think of like where could you just
 
think of like where could you just
steal, you know, templates to do this?
 
steal, you know, templates to do this?
You know, your point, Kelly, you're like
 
You know, your point, Kelly, you're like
in motiva. How could I do something like
 
in motiva. How could I do something like
 
running? And, you know, when you rent an
 
running? And, you know, when you rent an
apartment, the terms of like handing the
 
apartment, the terms of like handing the
apartment back is in the lease.
 
apartment back is in the lease.
You know, it's like you got to restore
 
You know, it's like you got to restore
the paint to the original color and
 
the paint to the original color and
anything on the wall you got to put.
 
anything on the wall you got to put.
It's like some very basic standards. And
 
It's like some very basic standards. And
I'm like, you could totally do something
 
I'm like, you could totally do something
like that in an offer letter. You're
 
like that in an offer letter. You're
like, look, whatever you quit, you could
 
like, look, whatever you quit, you could
quit in six months, you could quit in
 
quit in six months, you could quit in
six years, but these are kind of like
 
six years, but these are kind of like
our base level expectations on how
 
our base level expectations on how
you're going to handle it. And it'd be
 
you're going to handle it. And it'd be
better than it'd be better than nothing,
 
better than it'd be better than nothing,
you know, cuz to your point, Nolan, like
 
you know, cuz to your point, Nolan, like
it's Nolan, you're right, like the
 
it's Nolan, you're right, like the
assumption is this is the last offer
 
assumption is this is the last offer
you're ever going to accept in your
 
you're ever going to accept in your
career, you know, working for us
 
career, you know, working for us
forever. And it's not true. You know,
 
forever. And it's not true. You know,
you're probably going to leave at some
 
you're probably going to leave at some

small and I agree with all that. We
 
small and I agree with all that. We
don't nearly talk about how managers
 
don't nearly talk about how managers
also [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up. And it says so much
 
also [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up. And it says so much
about you as a leader how you respond
 
about you as a leader how you respond
and react to that news. And believe me,
 
and react to that news. And believe me,
if you're doing that stuff, Brian, like
 
if you're doing that stuff, Brian, like
no one's going to no one's going to work
 
no one's going to no one's going to work
for you, follow you anywhere. And that's
 
for you, follow you anywhere. And that's
one of the first things I look for in
 
one of the first things I look for in
leaders that we hire is who will follow
 
leaders that we hire is who will follow
you? What kind of leader are you? and
 
you? What kind of leader are you? and
come across a ton of them. Like that's

points as a manager when a good person
 
points as a manager when a good person
leaves at most companies, right? And so
 
leaves at most companies, right? And so
it's so much easier to just be like,
 
it's so much easier to just be like,
"Oh, like they they were shitty anyways.
 
"Oh, like they they were shitty anyways.
Like we can replace them, right?"

Because they're covering what the

which is letting go. Like you didn't
 
which is letting go. Like you didn't

that I ever got came when I transitioned
 
that I ever got came when I transitioned
out of my first manager role. I was
 
out of my first manager role. I was
distraught about what my team would do
 
distraught about what my team would do
without me and thought I should stay for
 
without me and thought I should stay for
weeks if not months. The HRBP that I
 
weeks if not months. The HRBP that I

clearly so true you know and I was just
 
clearly so true you know and I was just
like whining too much but the truth is
 
like whining too much but the truth is
when you feel that people move on. It's
 
when you feel that people move on. It's
It's very risky for you because you're
 
It's very risky for you because you're
like, "Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. I
 
like, "Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. I
thought like, you know, yesterday you're

does there's there's a little bit of
 
does there's there's a little bit of
people are now moving into the new
 
people are now moving into the new
reality. It's not like a showing their
 
reality. It's not like a showing their
true colors thing. It's now like you're

not on the team. They got to figure that
 
not on the team. They got to figure that
out as quickly as they can. And don't
 
out as quickly as they can. And don't
you shouldn't I don't think you should
 
you shouldn't I don't think you should
judge people when they move on to their
 
judge people when they move on to their
new reality quickly because it's just
 
new reality quickly because it's just
kind of your own ego or being selfish to
 
kind of your own ego or being selfish to
want it to be drawn out. And this is why
 
want it to be drawn out. And this is why
I think when people stick around for too
 
I think when people stick around for too
long, here's what I think happens.
 
long, here's what I think happens.
People give notice and the manager's

You got to give me more time, a minimum
 
You got to give me more time, a minimum
of a month, at least two months." But
 
of a month, at least two months." But
they're really like trying to create the
 
they're really like trying to create the
space to figure out what to do. And
 
space to figure out what to do. And
every time I've seen this, once you
 
every time I've seen this, once you
solve that problem of, okay, now we need
 
solve that problem of, okay, now we need
to know what to do, which can be like a
 
to know what to do, which can be like a
week, the other person should just
 
week, the other person should just
really move out as quickly as possible
 
really move out as quickly as possible
because there's there's only downside
 
because there's there's only downside

this person to basically light
 
this person to basically light
themselves on fire on the way out the
 
themselves on fire on the way out the

Kelly when someone's like hey everything
I'm responsible for here's the best
 
I'm responsible for here's the best
option here's what to do and you're at
 
option here's what to do and you're at
least investing in making the transition

to success versus like I quit My last
day is next Friday. Someone else got to
 
day is next Friday. Someone else got to
figure it out now. Good luck with that,
 
figure it out now. Good luck with that,
you know, which which is going to breed
 
you know, which which is going to breed
resentment.
 
resentment.
&gt;&gt; Yes. And if you're a manager, just going
 
&gt;&gt; Yes. And if you're a manager, just going
about your day like duckies and horses.
 
about your day like duckies and horses.
No one's ever going to leave. You're
 
No one's ever going to leave. You're

&gt;&gt; As my kids would say, you're you're
 
&gt;&gt; As my kids would say, you're you're

cooked.
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to say six, seven.
 
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to say six, seven.
&gt;&gt; It's terrible. I do it every three
 
&gt;&gt; It's terrible. I do it every three
weeks. Like I don't think anyone here is
 
weeks. Like I don't think anyone here is
leaving, but I'm like I'm upset. What if
 
leaving, but I'm like I'm upset. What if
they leave? how my how my thing like
 
they leave? how my how my thing like
that is how a leader should run their
 
that is how a leader should run their
team.
 
team.
&gt;&gt; That's great, Kelly. I am surprised
 
&gt;&gt; That's great, Kelly. I am surprised
how much of like a great idea that is
 
how much of like a great idea that is
that other people don't do because I did
 
that other people don't do because I did
that, too. I'm constantly scenario
 
that, too. I'm constantly scenario
planning. Okay, if they leave, who who
 
planning. Okay, if they leave, who who
do I have today that I can put into that
 
do I have today that I can put into that
job? And it's going to be a terrible
 
job? And it's going to be a terrible
battlefield promotion, but at least I'm
 
battlefield promotion, but at least I'm
starting to work out the playbook of
 
starting to work out the playbook of
like what I'm going to do.
 
like what I'm going to do.
&gt;&gt; And you're right, like I'm amazed.
 
&gt;&gt; And you're right, like I'm amazed.
&gt;&gt; Secret selfish. Sorry. Yeah, but I'm
 
&gt;&gt; Secret selfish. Sorry. Yeah, but I'm
amazed at how many people are just like
 
amazed at how many people are just like
assuming no one's ever going to leave
 
assuming no one's ever going to leave
and then they're like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this
 
and then they're like, "Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this
person quit and I I'm not ready." And so
 
person quit and I I'm not ready." And so
I I do think that's another thing where
 
I I do think that's another thing where
people leading
 
people leading
&gt;&gt; organizations, you just got to
 
&gt;&gt; organizations, you just got to
constantly be running through all the
 
constantly be running through all the
time what you would do and then it's not
 
time what you would do and then it's not
as big of a deal when it happens.
 
as big of a deal when it happens.
&gt;&gt; Maybe we have to learn it like I I the
 
&gt;&gt; Maybe we have to learn it like I I the
reason I do it is because I am I am
 
reason I do it is because I am I am
traumatized by getting so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around
 
traumatized by getting so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around
this. [laughter]
 
this. [laughter]
totally
 
totally
&gt;&gt; like ultra paranoid at all times.
 
&gt;&gt; like ultra paranoid at all times.
&gt;&gt; So Brian, the part that you didn't cover
 
&gt;&gt; So Brian, the part that you didn't cover
was maintaining relationships after you
 
was maintaining relationships after you
leave. So maybe this is this is me, but
 
leave. So maybe this is this is me, but
like literally I remember when I left
 
like literally I remember when I left
Door Dash, who I didn't want to be was
 
Door Dash, who I didn't want to be was
Matthew McConna and Jason Confused
 
Matthew McConna and Jason Confused
hanging outside the high school. Like
 
hanging outside the high school. Like
I'd already like I'm out of there, but
 
I'd already like I'm out of there, but
like I'm still like hanging out with the
 
like I'm still like hanging out with the
people there.
 
people there.
there is like this I still kind of feel
 
there is like this I still kind of feel
awkward about that thing and I think
 
awkward about that thing and I think
even like maintaining the relationship
 
even like maintaining the relationship
like you have to give like some distance
 
like you have to give like some distance
but like you clearly were in the
 
but like you clearly were in the
trenches with these people and so like
 
trenches with these people and so like
the right amount of touch points with
 
the right amount of touch points with
that for me was super awkward. I don't
 
that for me was super awkward. I don't
know if you guys have ever felt that way
 
know if you guys have ever felt that way
in your career but it's like you got to
 
in your career but it's like you got to
like give that team space to go do it
 
like give that team space to go do it
but it's also that like goodbye I'm
 
but it's also that like goodbye I'm
never talking to you forever.
 
never talking to you forever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just want to hear from because I
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just want to hear from because I
love that.
 
love that.
&gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] All right. All
 
&gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] All right. All
right.
 
right.
&gt;&gt; I think um you want to like you
 
&gt;&gt; I think um you want to like you
definitely want to be there for people
 
definitely want to be there for people
who may need your help after you left,
 
who may need your help after you left,
but even that you want to make sure they
 
but even that you want to make sure they
know it's clear like I'm not here
 
know it's clear like I'm not here
anymore. You you kind of need to do it.
 
anymore. You you kind of need to do it.
And so, um that's a tough space to try
 
And so, um that's a tough space to try
to negotiate fair for everybody where
 
to negotiate fair for everybody where
they don't feel like you just totally
 
they don't feel like you just totally
dumped it on them, but also like you're
 
dumped it on them, but also like you're
you did move you did move on, you know,
 
you did move you did move on, you know,
and so they got to they got to figure
 
and so they got to they got to figure
out new ways forward. But then the
 
out new ways forward. But then the
second thing is just the actual
 
second thing is just the actual
relationships. Like I think the time
 
relationships. Like I think the time
goes by pretty quick, you know, and I
 
goes by pretty quick, you know, and I
think you can reach back out to whoever
 
think you can reach back out to whoever
you want to stay in touch with once
 
you want to stay in touch with once
you've kind of, you know, the calendar's
 
you've kind of, you know, the calendar's
turn. And I and I think I regret not
 
turn. And I and I think I regret not
doing that more than doing it too early
 
doing that more than doing it too early
because then you're like, I haven't
 
because then you're like, I haven't
talked to this person in like years now.
 
talked to this person in like years now.
Now it's almost like someone from high
 
Now it's almost like someone from high
school. It's like it took
 
school. It's like it took
&gt;&gt; what the hell is wrong with me? Why
 
&gt;&gt; what the hell is wrong with me? Why
didn't I maintain that? I should have
 
didn't I maintain that? I should have
maintained that thing. Yes. Exactly. But
 
maintained that thing. Yes. Exactly. But
then I think also but I also think
 
then I think also but I also think
people like some people are like
 
people like some people are like
connectors, you know, they're the people
 
connectors, you know, they're the people
who reach out to people they used to
 
who reach out to people they used to
work with over time and people
 
work with over time and people
appreciate when someone does it. You
 
appreciate when someone does it. You
just got to put it out there. Yep. 100%.
 
just got to put it out there. Yep. 100%.
All right, let's let's transition to
 
All right, let's let's transition to
some other tech news. So, if you work in
 
some other tech news. So, if you work in
our space in people and talent and
 
our space in people and talent and
you've been living under a rock, the
 
you've been living under a rock, the
biggest news of the last week was that
 
biggest news of the last week was that
Growth by Design, uh, which was founded
 
Growth by Design, uh, which was founded
by Adam, Jill, and Mike, was acquired,
 
by Adam, Jill, and Mike, was acquired,
Aquaired. I'm not exactly sure like what
 
Aquaired. I'm not exactly sure like what
the thing was, but that firm is now no
 
the thing was, but that firm is now no
more. And Mike and Adam, as at least
 
more. And Mike and Adam, as at least
it's been told to me by friends, are now
 
it's been told to me by friends, are now
working at Cursor. Um, that's like a
 
working at Cursor. Um, that's like a
pretty dope and huge thing uh that I did
 
pretty dope and huge thing uh that I did
not expect. Brian, what's your take on
 
not expect. Brian, what's your take on
that move?
 
that move?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so uh I think Adam those Adam
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so uh I think Adam those Adam
those guys are the first people I know
 
those guys are the first people I know
at Cursor. So I'm really just a
 
at Cursor. So I'm really just a
spectator of the company. They had this
 
spectator of the company. They had this
they had this article everyone was
 
they had this article everyone was
reading about inside Cursor that was in
 
reading about inside Cursor that was in
Colossus magazine that's like a deep
 
Colossus magazine that's like a deep
dive of working there. you know, they're
 
dive of working there. you know, they're
one of the fastest growing uh AI
 
one of the fastest growing uh AI
companies in a space that's growing like
 
companies in a space that's growing like
lightning. Like they are definitely a
 
lightning. Like they are definitely a
pace setter. Uh and they're a young
 
pace setter. Uh and they're a young
organization that's just doing lots of
 
organization that's just doing lots of
things their way clearly. And I have
 
things their way clearly. And I have
huge respect for that because especially
 
huge respect for that because especially
in this frothy AI market, a lot of
 
in this frothy AI market, a lot of
people are trying to cut and paste their
 
people are trying to cut and paste their
way to higher valuations. And again,
 
way to higher valuations. And again,
just for the outside, Cursor seems to be
 
just for the outside, Cursor seems to be
really cutting their own path. And
 
really cutting their own path. And
buying, you know, getting Growth by
 
buying, you know, getting Growth by
Design off the table and inside was a
 
Design off the table and inside was a
jaw-dropper. You know, they Next Door
 
jaw-dropper. You know, they Next Door
was a customer of Growth by Design. I've
 
was a customer of Growth by Design. I've
had tremendous respect for Adam. I've
 
had tremendous respect for Adam. I've
known all of them, but Adam in
 
known all of them, but Adam in
particular is an absolute monster in the
 
particular is an absolute monster in the
talent space. Like a legend. And they've
 
talent space. Like a legend. And they've
helped like hundreds of tech companies.
 
helped like hundreds of tech companies.
And you know, the reason they did that
 
And you know, the reason they did that
is because like one company wasn't
 
is because like one company wasn't
enough for them. They're going to help
 
enough for them. They're going to help
all these companies at once. But that
 
all these companies at once. But that
just is even more impressive for cursor
 
just is even more impressive for cursor
to be able to convince them to come join
 
to be able to convince them to come join
what they're doing. And you know, I was
 
what they're doing. And you know, I was
telling you before, it also is hurtful
 
telling you before, it also is hurtful
to all the people that depended on
 
to all the people that depended on
growth by design to help grow their
 
growth by design to help grow their
organizations because this now huge
 
organizations because this now huge
capability is off the market and inside
 
capability is off the market and inside
of a customer of one cursor. So, I was
 
of a customer of one cursor. So, I was
just that's really impressive. I I think
 
just that's really impressive. I I think
that is going to be a even more of a net
 
that is going to be a even more of a net
positive for Cursor, which is already
 
positive for Cursor, which is already
doing a great job with recruiting uh
 
doing a great job with recruiting uh
great people uh in a fascinating way.
 
great people uh in a fascinating way.
You know, one thing that they talk about
 
You know, one thing that they talk about
in the article, so I can't validate in
 
in the article, so I can't validate in
this, is that they kind of brag about
 
this, is that they kind of brag about
spending a quarter of their time on
 
spending a quarter of their time on
recruiting. And so many startups that I
 
recruiting. And so many startups that I
talk to, I talk to the recruiting
 
talk to, I talk to the recruiting
leaders and their challenge is they
 
leaders and their challenge is they
can't get people at the startup to spend
 
can't get people at the startup to spend
more time on recruiting. They're like
 
more time on recruiting. They're like
they want the recruiters to do
 
they want the recruiters to do
everything. And this is like definitely
 
everything. And this is like definitely
the common thing. And the companies that
 
the common thing. And the companies that
dominate, every person believes it's
 
dominate, every person believes it's
personally important to impact getting
 
personally important to impact getting
more people, great people to join. It's
 
more people, great people to join. It's
not like I'm in meetings all week and
 
not like I'm in meetings all week and
I'll forward a email template, an AI
 
I'll forward a email template, an AI
drafted email template to someone with
 
drafted email template to someone with
nine other offers. You know, that's like
 
nine other offers. You know, that's like
the level of effort. So the fact that
 
the level of effort. So the fact that
Ker already had this huge recruiting
 
Ker already had this huge recruiting
culture and added these like true
 
culture and added these like true
legends from talent was caught my
 
legends from talent was caught my
attention. Absolutely.
 
attention. Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; I don't think I have um much to add. I
 
&gt;&gt; I don't think I have um much to add. I
just to me my first reaction was that's
 
just to me my first reaction was that's
a really creative move. You know, you're
 
a really creative move. You know, you're
used to these companies acquiring other,
 
used to these companies acquiring other,
you know what I mean? Techto tech,
 
you know what I mean? Techto tech,
right? other, you know, tools or and and
 
right? other, you know, tools or and and
I thought it was a really interesting
 
I thought it was a really interesting
&gt;&gt; um almost like a leaprog kind of like
 
&gt;&gt; um almost like a leaprog kind of like
wow hard right turn and I think it it
 
wow hard right turn and I think it it
turned a lot of people's heads. So, I'm
 
turned a lot of people's heads. So, I'm
actually interested to see what this um
 
actually interested to see what this um
starts. You guys know how this industry
 
starts. You guys know how this industry
is or maybe we should acquire like I I'm
 
is or maybe we should acquire like I I'm
interested to see what what this um
 
interested to see what what this um
unleashes.
 
unleashes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So there's one analog that I can
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So there's one analog that I can
think of which was the bank Robin Hood
 
think of which was the bank Robin Hood
Robin Hood acquiring bank uh back in the
 
Robin Hood acquiring bank uh back in the
day you know famously I I think that
 
day you know famously I I think that
timing was you know there's two parties
 
timing was you know there's two parties
in this transaction
 
in this transaction
&gt;&gt; right there's the there's GBD and then
 
&gt;&gt; right there's the there's GBD and then
there's cursor and the bank and Robin
 
there's cursor and the bank and Robin
Hood transaction you know you talk to
 
Hood transaction you know you talk to
anybody who is like bank timed it
 
anybody who is like bank timed it
perfectly like and then the market
 
perfectly like and then the market
crashed and then basically like every
 
crashed and then basically like every
you know all recruiters were getting
 
you know all recruiters were getting
laid off at the time. And so like you
 
laid off at the time. And so like you
know if you're in that business like
 
know if you're in that business like
that a friend texted exactly this to me
 
that a friend texted exactly this to me
earlier this week. He's like it's always
 
earlier this week. He's like it's always
better to leave a little bit early from
 
better to leave a little bit early from
the party than to leave too late.
 
the party than to leave too late.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I thought that was like spot on.
 
&gt;&gt; And I thought that was like spot on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's um you know
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's um you know
that's like got the benefit of
 
that's like got the benefit of
hindsight, but I remember that time when
 
hindsight, but I remember that time when
Robin Hood announced that being totally
 
Robin Hood announced that being totally
distraught because bank had dozens of
 
distraught because bank had dozens of
really good edge recruiters that were
 
really good edge recruiters that were
all over the industry and all of a
 
all over the industry and all of a
sudden those on-site contract recruiters
 
sudden those on-site contract recruiters
resigned that day and were all going to
 
resigned that day and were all going to
Robin Hood which just amped up and
 
Robin Hood which just amped up and
became they just jumped to having it was
 
became they just jumped to having it was
something like 40 or 50 engineering
 
something like 40 or 50 engineering
recruiters who were in the flow of all
 
recruiters who were in the flow of all
these pipelines of all these other
 
these pipelines of all these other
companies. So yeah, I mean then the
 
companies. So yeah, I mean then the
market flipped like next the week after
 
market flipped like next the week after
that or whatever, but I remember when I
 
that or whatever, but I remember when I
heard that I was like, what am I going
 
heard that I was like, what am I going
to do? You know, that was such a such a
 
to do? You know, that was such a such a
huge move that to your point, Kelly,
 
huge move that to your point, Kelly,
like you talk about it, but not a lot of
 
like you talk about it, but not a lot of
companies are willing to make a move at
 
companies are willing to make a move at
that that st that scale.
 
that that st that scale.
&gt;&gt; There's going to be copycats though,
 
&gt;&gt; There's going to be copycats though,
Kelly, I think you're exactly right. Um,
 
Kelly, I think you're exactly right. Um,
you know, I'm running talent searches
 
you know, I'm running talent searches
right now. It's there's very clearly a
 
right now. It's there's very clearly a
need at the top end to where people have
 
need at the top end to where people have
great jobs, they don't want to move or
 
great jobs, they don't want to move or
there's just like not enough people who
 
there's just like not enough people who
are ready for like that next thing. And
 
are ready for like that next thing. And
if you are a talent leader, there's a
 
if you are a talent leader, there's a
ton of agency involved in building your
 
ton of agency involved in building your
own business. And now I think people see
 
own business. And now I think people see
that that you know this GBD hole that's
 
that that you know this GBD hole that's
been left to your point, Brian, like
 
been left to your point, Brian, like
they've helped hundreds of companies and
 
they've helped hundreds of companies and
now gone. So now all of a sudden that
 
now gone. So now all of a sudden that
there's going to be a vacuum there that
 
there's going to be a vacuum there that
needs to get filled which is going to I
 
needs to get filled which is going to I
think probably accelerate more people
 
think probably accelerate more people
building their own business and then
 
building their own business and then
more companies therefore being like who
 
more companies therefore being like who
do we go for? Like if you're the top end
 
do we go for? Like if you're the top end
like cursor super hot, you know, $30
 
like cursor super hot, you know, $30
billion valuation, you're like 300
 
billion valuation, you're like 300
people, who do you call for help now?
 
people, who do you call for help now?
Who's going to want to come do that
 
Who's going to want to come do that
thing? Because that's not a Google like
 
thing? Because that's not a Google like
nothing against Google, but that's a
 
nothing against Google, but that's a
 
&gt;&gt; That is a completely different problem
 
&gt;&gt; That is a completely different problem
set
 
set
&gt;&gt; that I think Adam is so uniquely capable
 
&gt;&gt; that I think Adam is so uniquely capable
of solving. So I'm I am fascinated to
 
of solving. So I'm I am fascinated to
see how this thing plays out. I do think
 
see how this thing plays out. I do think
it's like a pretty gangster move from
 
it's like a pretty gangster move from
all parties involved.
 
all parties involved.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um on the on a good note as
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um on the on a good note as
well, I mean, we've talked, you know, at
 
well, I mean, we've talked, you know, at
Nauseium about the layoffs and
 
Nauseium about the layoffs and
especially recruiting teams, you know,
 
especially recruiting teams, you know,
and I I really like the upswing this is
 
and I I really like the upswing this is
going to create, right? The demand's
 
going to create, right? The demand's
going to increase for recruiters. A lot
 
going to increase for recruiters. A lot
of folks that have been struggling are
 
of folks that have been struggling are
going to get back in the game. Like, I
 
going to get back in the game. Like, I
like that momentum.
 
like that momentum.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting. I've always
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting. I've always
thought, yeah, I've [snorts] always
 
thought, yeah, I've [snorts] always
thought that recruiter availability is
 
thought that recruiter availability is
the best canary on where the market's
 
the best canary on where the market's
headed. And I see more and more
 
headed. And I see more and more
recruiters have jobs now than did
 
recruiters have jobs now than did
before. Again, it's all anecdotal. I
 
before. Again, it's all anecdotal. I
don't have like the report of what's the
 
don't have like the report of what's the
unemployment rate of recruiters. But I
 
unemployment rate of recruiters. But I
just I've seen a lot of people that had
 
just I've seen a lot of people that had
a tough go in 23 and 24 are working now
 
a tough go in 23 and 24 are working now
and they're also working at good comp.
 
and they're also working at good comp.
And like when that changes, you know,
 
And like when that changes, you know,
things people have started to make
 
things people have started to make
different decisions, but it's like a
 
different decisions, but it's like a
six-month leading indicator. And I just
 
six-month leading indicator. And I just
think right now a lot of the recruiters
 
think right now a lot of the recruiters
are flat out and they're all competing
 
are flat out and they're all competing
against each other. And it's a lot. So
 
against each other. And it's a lot. So
everyone talks about like frothy bubble.
 
everyone talks about like frothy bubble.
You never know when that's going to
 
You never know when that's going to
stop. It's dumb to try to to call it,
 
stop. It's dumb to try to to call it,
but right now it just feels like the
 
but right now it just feels like the
motor is running. You know, people
 
motor is running. You know, people
people are really competing.
 
people are really competing.
&gt;&gt; I will I will take the other side on
 
&gt;&gt; I will I will take the other side on
that. So, like right before this
 
that. So, like right before this
conversation, I was talking to a friend
 
conversation, I was talking to a friend
that's in the consulting. He he does
 
that's in the consulting. He he does
tech consulting. It's comp consulting.
 
tech consulting. It's comp consulting.
And one of the things I was asking about
 
And one of the things I was asking about
comp and like what what are you saying?
 
comp and like what what are you saying?
And he goes for every AI company 90th
 
And he goes for every AI company 90th
percentile is the new 50th.
 
percentile is the new 50th.
And I go, well, that's that's
 
And I go, well, that's that's
interesting cuz like the math doesn't
 
interesting cuz like the math doesn't
math on that. If headcounts were what
 
math on that. If headcounts were what
they were 10 years ago, and clearly
 
they were 10 years ago, and clearly
they're not. He's like, they're not.
 
they're not. He's like, they're not.
like headc counts are smaller. If you
 
like headc counts are smaller. If you
look at public tech companies, it's
 
look at public tech companies, it's
basically flat
 
basically flat
since 2022. And he said, and what he was
 
since 2022. And he said, and what he was
really concerned about, he had a number
 
really concerned about, he had a number
of examples of where people were like
 
of examples of where people were like
really getting hurt at the lower and mid
 
really getting hurt at the lower and mid
tier. He goes, it's just going to keep
 
tier. He goes, it's just going to keep
it's going to basically skip lower and
 
it's going to basically skip lower and
mid tier and keep flowing to the top. So
 
mid tier and keep flowing to the top. So
like the best will continue to acrue a
 
like the best will continue to acrue a
ton of value. And that value used to
 
ton of value. And that value used to
trickle down in the form of like, oh,
 
trickle down in the form of like, oh,
there's recruiting coordinator jobs
 
there's recruiting coordinator jobs
open, there's sorcerer jobs open. Now
 
open, there's sorcerer jobs open. Now
there's like very very few of these jobs
 
there's like very very few of these jobs
and more people across the company to
 
and more people across the company to
Kurser's point everybody should be
 
Kurser's point everybody should be
involved in recruiting. You should spend
 
involved in recruiting. You should spend
 
thought at Door Dash too. So I'm not
 
thought at Door Dash too. So I'm not
sure it's going to be this like big
 
sure it's going to be this like big
trickle down effect. I think it's more
 
trickle down effect. I think it's more
going to be you know value gets really
 
going to be you know value gets really
acred to the top end of the market.
 
acred to the top end of the market.
That's my take.
 
That's my take.
&gt;&gt; I actually don't think we're saying
 
&gt;&gt; I actually don't think we're saying
opposite things. I think what what the
 
opposite things. I think what what the
difference here Nolan is the timing is
 
difference here Nolan is the timing is
the timing of things. So I think what I
 
the timing of things. So I think what I
heard Brian and I saying is compared to
 
heard Brian and I saying is compared to
the enterprise SAS just blow up you know
 
the enterprise SAS just blow up you know
 
this is a uptick up as far as the number
 
this is a uptick up as far as the number
of companies mostly AI there are other
 
of companies mostly AI there are other
industries but the number of number of
 
industries but the number of number of
companies back in growth mode that are
 
companies back in growth mode that are
like seething to hire talent and get
 
like seething to hire talent and get
recruiters is different than it was two
 
recruiters is different than it was two
years ago in a in a positive way. Now
 
years ago in a in a positive way. Now
over time to your point as AI comes in
 
over time to your point as AI comes in
or whatnot that might be true but
 
or whatnot that might be true but
&gt;&gt; yeah I think it's uh okay my take is uh
 
&gt;&gt; yeah I think it's uh okay my take is uh
clearly entry level role roles have been
 
clearly entry level role roles have been
hit very hard you know like right now
 
hit very hard you know like right now
people have just turned it off I I think
 
people have just turned it off I I think
that's a big mistake but it's what
 
that's a big mistake but it's what
everybody's doing and the reason I think
 
everybody's doing and the reason I think
it's a mistake is the the kids say kids
 
it's a mistake is the the kids say kids
because I'm my 50s the kids coming out
 
because I'm my 50s the kids coming out
of college are learning this stuff so
 
of college are learning this stuff so
fast that the companies are going to
 
fast that the companies are going to
need this skill set. One of my favorite
 
need this skill set. One of my favorite
takes, I've quoted this a bunch of times
 
takes, I've quoted this a bunch of times
now, um I was at a conference three
 
now, um I was at a conference three
weeks ago and this woman was on stage.
 
weeks ago and this woman was on stage.
She's in charge of AI transformation at
 
She's in charge of AI transformation at
JP Morgan. I forget her name now, but
 
JP Morgan. I forget her name now, but
they have 250,000 employees. And her
 
they have 250,000 employees. And her
take was in three to five years, people
 
take was in three to five years, people
are going to expect when they join a
 
are going to expect when they join a
company that agents do all the manual
 
company that agents do all the manual
work. And the take right now is that
 
work. And the take right now is that
agents are going to replace all those
 
agents are going to replace all those
people. What's really going to happen is
 
people. What's really going to happen is
people will know how to manage agents
 
people will know how to manage agents
and build agents to do things. And if
 
and build agents to do things. And if
you have not built out that
 
you have not built out that
infrastructure at your company, people
 
infrastructure at your company, people
are going to look at you as like an old
 
are going to look at you as like an old
company, you know, and I was kind of
 
company, you know, and I was kind of
like, wow, that's this weird thing. But
 
like, wow, that's this weird thing. But
it is true. And I I do think though it
 
it is true. And I I do think though it
is going to take a long time for these
 
is going to take a long time for these
companies to effectively deploy
 
companies to effectively deploy
artificial intelligence in how they do
 
artificial intelligence in how they do
things. And you see this with just how
 
things. And you see this with just how
much juice there is on people trying to
 
much juice there is on people trying to
find deployment people at consulting
 
find deployment people at consulting
companies. all the AI companies like
 
companies. all the AI companies like
Enthropic and Open AD, they're all
 
Enthropic and Open AD, they're all
trying to hire people to go to their
 
trying to hire people to go to their
customers and help them figure out how
 
customers and help them figure out how
to do it. And it's not like people like
 
to do it. And it's not like people like
Kelly and me like I've been trying, but
 
Kelly and me like I've been trying, but
like we're freaking busy and it doesn't
 
like we're freaking busy and it doesn't
work out of the box, you know? And so
 
work out of the box, you know? And so
that means it's not going to happen in
 
that means it's not going to happen in
 
and all the jobs go away, but these
 
and all the jobs go away, but these
people who will be really AI native
 
people who will be really AI native
skills will be so valuable to help push
 
skills will be so valuable to help push
that from underneath that I just think
 
that from underneath that I just think
it's gonna come back around.
 
it's gonna come back around.
&gt;&gt; It's like the new era. remember like
 
&gt;&gt; It's like the new era. remember like
digital transformation and all that a
 
digital transformation and all that a
few there's like there's a job like head
 
few there's like there's a job like head
of digital transformation and they would
 
of digital transformation and they would
just like get inserted into these
 
just like get inserted into these
companies to help. It's kind of similar
 
companies to help. It's kind of similar
to that just a
 
to that just a
&gt;&gt; It is. But the difference I've been
 
&gt;&gt; It is. But the difference I've been
thinking about this because you're
 
thinking about this because you're
right, there's always been solutions
 
right, there's always been solutions
engineers and stuff like that, but the
 
engineers and stuff like that, but the
technology they were deploying was
 
technology they were deploying was
pretty much out of the box. It does this
 
pretty much out of the box. It does this
and you can customize a little bit but
 
and you can customize a little bit but
not much where what you can do with AI
 
not much where what you can do with AI
and I was so customizable. You really
 
and I was so customizable. You really
need someone smart to think about what
 
need someone smart to think about what
you want to build inside of your
 
you want to build inside of your
company. And again, no one has
 
company. And again, no one has
experience doing it. It's like two years
 
experience doing it. It's like two years
&gt;&gt; and none of it gets to the last mile.
 
&gt;&gt; and none of it gets to the last mile.
None of it goes to the last mile.
 
None of it goes to the last mile.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. That's the That's the
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. That's the That's the
main thing. Um Ari Emanuel was on the
 
main thing. Um Ari Emanuel was on the
Invest with the Best podcast which just
 
Invest with the Best podcast which just
launched like yesterday and the day
 
launched like yesterday and the day
before. It's so good. It like I I'm
 
before. It's so good. It like I I'm
listening to this podcast more and more.
 
listening to this podcast more and more.
It's a phenomenal. This is the same Ari
 
It's a phenomenal. This is the same Ari
from Entourage.
 
from Entourage.
And one of the things that him and
 
And one of the things that him and
Patrick were talking about on the
 
Patrick were talking about on the
episode, which I I I hadn't thought
 
episode, which I I I hadn't thought
about, but I totally agree with, is AI,
 
about, but I totally agree with, is AI,
I think, is disproportionately helping
 
I think, is disproportionately helping
the best people become even better and
 
the best people become even better and
kind of bringing everyone else to this
 
kind of bringing everyone else to this
like median place. And so, Brian, to
 
like median place. And so, Brian, to
your point, I agree with you. Um, I
 
your point, I agree with you. Um, I
strongly agree that there's so much
 
strongly agree that there's so much
alpha with these new grads if companies
 
alpha with these new grads if companies
will invest in them. But everybody wants
 
will invest in them. But everybody wants
results today, which goes back to the
 
results today, which goes back to the
comp co comp conversation, which is why
 
comp co comp conversation, which is why
everyone's paying 90th, cuz it's like I
 
everyone's paying 90th, cuz it's like I
don't want to wait. I don't want to have
 
don't want to wait. I don't want to have
a long feedback cycle if I hire somebody
 
a long feedback cycle if I hire somebody
to ROI in their employment. And I think
 
to ROI in their employment. And I think
it's it's very shortsighted. Everyone's
 
it's it's very shortsighted. Everyone's
just trying to condense the feedback
 
just trying to condense the feedback
cycle to like give me value today and
 
cycle to like give me value today and
they're not thinking longer term. Um,
 
they're not thinking longer term. Um,
and I think a lot of these companies are
 
and I think a lot of these companies are
going to get burned by that because
 
going to get burned by that because
they're going to have a very small bench
 
they're going to have a very small bench
and they're going to wish they would
 
and they're going to wish they would
have done that. I've been talking to
 
have done that. I've been talking to
recruiters about this for a long time. I
 
recruiters about this for a long time. I
think that's why we have a shortage in
 
think that's why we have a shortage in
recruiting because we're not investing
 
recruiting because we're not investing
in new hiring where there's so much
 
in new hiring where there's so much
talent.
 
talent.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, let me take the other side
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, let me take the other side
of that. Just living in one of these
 
of that. Just living in one of these
companies, Nolan. Yeah. time is not a
 
companies, Nolan. Yeah. time is not a
luxury that
 
luxury that
a lot of these companies have given the
 
a lot of these companies have given the
pace of the competition. Um the pace of
 
pace of the competition. Um the pace of
of folks investing in these I mean we
 
of folks investing in these I mean we
look at at Supio we're like boom Eve
 
look at at Supio we're like boom Eve
boom another million boom 60 million
 
boom another million boom 60 million
like it this is a race and
 
like it this is a race and
of course we're trying to kind of calm
 
of course we're trying to kind of calm
it down and go a little bit slower to go
 
it down and go a little bit slower to go
fast but that that is sounds nice. It's
 
fast but that that is sounds nice. It's
funny because no one always tells me I'm
 
funny because no one always tells me I'm
the I'm the, you know, utopia one.
 
the I'm the, you know, utopia one.
Sounds nice, but in reality with this
 
Sounds nice, but in reality with this
situation, at this exact moment in time,
 
situation, at this exact moment in time,
with this AI thing, it's a little bit
 
with this AI thing, it's a little bit
harder practice.
 
harder practice.
&gt;&gt; I agreed. I think it's like, this is
 
&gt;&gt; I agreed. I think it's like, this is
bite-sized for me. This is not, excuse
 
bite-sized for me. This is not, excuse
me, it's not go hire 30 new grads for a
 
me, it's not go hire 30 new grads for a
 
um have them do some sort of like
 
um have them do some sort of like
rotation thing that are just like elite
 
rotation thing that are just like elite
kids, right? Like there's so much talent
 
kids, right? Like there's so much talent
available there that one of the things
 
available there that one of the things
we did at Door Dash is we had this
 
we did at Door Dash is we had this
launch team and we we had an intentional
 
launch team and we we had an intentional
decision to overhire on that team just
 
decision to overhire on that team just
slightly so we could have slack that we
 
slightly so we could have slack that we
could deploy in other areas of the
 
could deploy in other areas of the
company that were feeling pinched. You
 
company that were feeling pinched. You
just get generalists. And the thing with
 
just get generalists. And the thing with
generalists are going away right now and
 
generalists are going away right now and
I think there's there is still so much
 
I think there's there is still so much
room to be had for like that type of
 
room to be had for like that type of
person. What do you think, Brian?
 
person. What do you think, Brian?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think on to Kelly's point, the
 
&gt;&gt; Well, I think on to Kelly's point, the
thing that I've always come back to is
 
thing that I've always come back to is
like you're going to hire people with no
 
like you're going to hire people with no
experience and they're going to have
 
experience and they're going to have
like three to five years experience
 
like three to five years experience
before you freaking look up. And you're
 
before you freaking look up. And you're
like, we don't have time to train them,
 
like, we don't have time to train them,
but that time goes by really fast. And
 
but that time goes by really fast. And
people with no experience learn really
 
people with no experience learn really
fast if you do a good job with it. And
 
fast if you do a good job with it. And
they also don't know what they don't
 
they also don't know what they don't
know. So they don't spend three years
 
know. So they don't spend three years
telling you to do it the way their last
 
telling you to do it the way their last
company did it, which is a ton of
 
company did it, which is a ton of
friction you get from experienced
 
friction you get from experienced
people. But the reality is is to to N's
 
people. But the reality is is to to N's
point, everyone's trying to hire the
 
point, everyone's trying to hire the
people with 10 years of experience.
 
people with 10 years of experience.
You're not going to get them. You're not
 
You're not going to get them. You're not
nearly going to get as nearly as many as
 
nearly going to get as nearly as many as
you think. Even if you are a leading
 
you think. Even if you are a leading
tech company right now, you're not
 
tech company right now, you're not
getting as many as you want because
 
getting as many as you want because
everyone wants them. And so you you
 
everyone wants them. And so you you
could easily spend three or four years
 
could easily spend three or four years
like not getting the people you say we
 
like not getting the people you say we
can only hire and you're in the same
 
can only hire and you're in the same
spot. And but if you just do both, at
 
spot. And but if you just do both, at
some point these kids become experienced
 
some point these kids become experienced
at your company doing it the way you
 
at your company doing it the way you
think that they should do it. And um the
 
think that they should do it. And um the
time goes fast is is definitely what uh
 
time goes fast is is definitely what uh
I've seen again and again and again.
 
I've seen again and again and again.
&gt;&gt; It does. I Exactly. Time does go fast.
 
&gt;&gt; It does. I Exactly. Time does go fast.
Especially if you're at a winning
 
Especially if you're at a winning
company. Like if it's growing super
 
company. Like if it's growing super
fast, it's very easy to think short
 
fast, it's very easy to think short
term, but like you have earned the right
 
term, but like you have earned the right
to solve the longer term problem and you
 
to solve the longer term problem and you
have to be thoughtful about it. Um,
 
have to be thoughtful about it. Um,
that's my take. Kelly, do you want to do
 
that's my take. Kelly, do you want to do
the uh, what is it? Slogans.
 
the uh, what is it? Slogans.
&gt;&gt; Let's go. Brian's squatting at
 
&gt;&gt; Let's go. Brian's squatting at
Crunchyroll and he's going to get kicked
 
Crunchyroll and he's going to get kicked
out in about six minutes. So, let's do
 
out in about six minutes. So, let's do
the let's do the cringy corporate logo.
 
the let's do the cringy corporate logo.
Now, remember, when you say the phrase,
 
Now, remember, when you say the phrase,
you have to use it in a sentence as
 
you have to use it in a sentence as
well. [snorts]
 
Very important.
 
Very important.
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm ready. Do I go first because
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm ready. Do I go first because
I'm the visitor?
 
I'm the visitor?
&gt;&gt; You could go first, Brian. Yeah, you're
 
&gt;&gt; You could go first, Brian. Yeah, you're
the guest. Yeah, Kelly, you went last
 
the guest. Yeah, Kelly, you went last
time and I've been thinking about this
 
time and I've been thinking about this
since the last time I was on because
 
since the last time I was on because
this is the one I actually wanted to do
 
this is the one I actually wanted to do
and I thought about it as soon as we
 
and I thought about it as soon as we
hung up the phone. So, the expression I
 
hung up the phone. So, the expression I
can't stand is I don't disagree.
 
can't stand is I don't disagree.
And people say this all the time in
 
And people say this all the time in
meetings and they say like no one will
 
meetings and they say like no one will
give a hot take. I'm like, well Nolan, I
 
give a hot take. I'm like, well Nolan, I
don't disagree with you and I basically
 
don't disagree with you and I basically
have said nothing. I've said Nolan,
 
have said nothing. I've said Nolan,
you're in bounds. I've not shown any
 
you're in bounds. I've not shown any
support for what you're saying, which
 
support for what you're saying, which
would be like Nolan, I agree with you.
 
would be like Nolan, I agree with you.
you know, I just say like I don't
 
you know, I just say like I don't
disagree and I can actually act like I'm
 
disagree and I can actually act like I'm
participating in the meeting on the
 
participating in the meeting on the
team, but I'm doing nothing. I'm staying
 
team, but I'm doing nothing. I'm staying
neutral. And so many of these companies
 
neutral. And so many of these companies
suffer because people are just playing
 
suffer because people are just playing
neutral all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and no one
 
neutral all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and no one
leans in or out on any of the debates.
 
leans in or out on any of the debates.
And the expression, I don't disagree,
 
And the expression, I don't disagree,
symbolizes that terrible behavior that
 
symbolizes that terrible behavior that
happens at bigger and bigger companies.
 
happens at bigger and bigger companies.
So I really now I just call people out.
 
So I really now I just call people out.
When someone says it, I'm like, no, but
 
When someone says it, I'm like, no, but
do you agree with me? I know you don't
 
do you agree with me? I know you don't
disagree. you would have disagreed, but
 
disagree. you would have disagreed, but
do you agree? And people are like, well,
 
do you agree? And people are like, well,
well, wait, wait, wait. Like, do I have
 
well, wait, wait, wait. Like, do I have
your support in what I just said? And it
 
your support in what I just said? And it
like shocks people because it's nice to
 
like shocks people because it's nice to
say nothing but sound like you said
 
say nothing but sound like you said
something good.
 
something good.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
 
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; In fact, you agree with me. Is that
 
&gt;&gt; In fact, you agree with me. Is that
right? Like, is that I was wondering you
 
right? Like, is that I was wondering you
agree?
 
agree?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you agree? And when people are
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you agree? And when people are
like, well, no. And I'm like, okay. So,
 
like, well, no. And I'm like, okay. So,
so you pretended to agree, but you
 
so you pretended to agree, but you
didn't say anything. That's mine.
 
didn't say anything. That's mine.
&gt;&gt; So, you pretended to agree.
 
&gt;&gt; So, you pretended to agree.
&gt;&gt; That was good, Brian. I like that. That
 
&gt;&gt; That was good, Brian. I like that. That
was spot on.
 
was spot on.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. One that's been pissing me off
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. One that's been pissing me off
lately that I just think is just such a
 
lately that I just think is just such a
dumb I don't necessarily agree with the
 
dumb I don't necessarily agree with the
concept. I just think it's such a dumb
 
concept. I just think it's such a dumb
word and it just
 
word and it just
&gt;&gt; elicits just laziness and just pure I
 
&gt;&gt; elicits just laziness and just pure I
don't even know what that means is I
 
don't even know what that means is I
don't have bandwidth.
