Hey, what's up everybody? Hope you're
doing well. Nolan and I are here for
another quick segment, hot take maybe.
Nolan, I don't know if you all saw, but
Ryan Brezlo posted from Bolt, CEO and
founder of Bolt, that they have
eliminated their HR department. quote
the quote after that Nolan is we have
now instead named it people ops
okay and it's a short LinkedIn post we
can put it in the show notes that just
basically talks about the reason for
eliminating eliminating HR and moving to
people ops is to focus more on
efficiency and focus less on fluff
you know escalating for serious employee
issues to a superior or or a people ops
team member, but basically wanting to
get rid of the middlemen getting in the
way of teammates and their managers. So
would love just to have a few minutes on
talking about this Nolan and get your
take.
Yeah, I mean you got to understand the
source first. So Ryan Brezlo is a very
interesting character. Couple things
that people should know about Ryan and
Bolt. Uh, one thing is is that a couple
years ago he went out and made some
serious claims on Twitter about like
venture capitalists like high-powered
venture capitalists and how they were
working against founders specifically.
Another thing is that he left the
company and as reported had sold a lot
of shares in secondary. Then the company
went through some hardships, was like
valued significantly less than the last
round, and then came back and now he's
like operating again. They also did like
a 4 day a week work week. Uh, and I
think they still actually do that today.
So, he's an interesting character on
like the nomenclature. Like I don't
really get it at all. Like Google was
called people ops. Like that's not like
anything new. What I do think is
interesting is more of the, you know,
some of these comments and some of the
comments is more around what you and I
have been talking about, Kelly, which is
like completely eliminating HR and now
falling like those responsibilities
falling under business operations.
That is is interesting. And I think what
I'm hearing from folks and what I'm
seeing in these comments is, you know,
we just want the operators to be able to
make business decisions without anything
slowing them down.
I get it. That piece I get. So, what's
your take?
Yeah. I mean, one one of the comments
said, you know, way to say something
without really saying anything at all. I
have to agree with that. Like, I I guess
I and I I would love to actually have
Riot on because no one likes shitty HR.
Like, we all don't like it. Even if
you're in HR, you're like, I don't like
shitty HR. It's the worst. Like, of
course, we don't want that. I just I I'm
not sure that he really has worked with
good good folks in this arena, Nolan,
because I've seen this thing renamed
over the years oodles of times. It
doesn't really matter what you call it.
It matters what you're doing and who's
doing it. That's my real take. Even with
good HR though, Kelly, like you and I
have both been in these these meetings
and conversations about things that end
up like you're talking about it more
than it would actually be to just like
roll it out and see what happens. And I
think that's like actually a lot of the
push back, which is like why are we
trying to, you know, fluff everything
up? Why are we trying to like, you know,
make people feel, you know, save it?
It's just like, let's just tell them
what's going on here. Let's move. Let's
operate in the business. Like, let's not
waste all of this time planning instead
of like actually going and operating.
That's the sentiment I read into this.
I'm not sure if that's actually true,
but I think there is some veracity to
that even if you work with really good
people.
Yeah. But the issue I take, Nolan, is
like any leader can do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] any
leader can hold things up and like I've
had name the function leader
add more fluff and BS to stuff we were
trying to roll out than HR did. So I'm
not sure why this is you know centered
on just HR. I mean any leader can have a
it's a mindset issue. It's not a
functional issue.
Well so I think the reason why it's
centered on HR is one is because of
speed right. So there's a perception
that uh HR and and legal are slowing
things down and the other is headcount
is like all of these companies are
getting leaner and so it's like you know
you have said this in the past which I
think is exactly right the work doesn't
go away it just gets transferred to
someone else and that's what I think I'm
seeing here is like well we used to have
an HR team now it's people ops who
reports up to bisops and they're just
going to like be a lot leaner and
they're not going to get involved on
most things. They're just going to make
sure people get paid, right? That we
have systems in place, that onboarding
happens, that there's some sort of
consistency. But like all of this other
stuff that we, you know, pingpong back
and forth for hours and take forever to
figure out, who cares? Just move,
announce it, move on.
Yeah. Yeah. I I look, you said it
yourself. Consider the source. There's a
lot more context and stuff that isn't in
this post of less than a thousand
letters or words. So, we're inferring a
lot of stuff here. But the questions I
would ask is that's wonderful. Who is
People Ops? What's the org structure?
How many of them are there? What do they
do? What's different? Because the work
the work doesn't go away. And if it's
going now from HR to people ops, I'd
love to actually I'd pay to go there and
and hang out for a couple days and
shadow. You know what I mean?
Yeah. He he does specifically call out
like we believe there's a better way to
do it and one without middlemen getting
in the way of our teammates and their
managers.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a

I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Dosha who leads talented signal fire
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metiv is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver. Because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
MeteView covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metav. Head over to metave.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metab's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
You know what's so funny though? Like
that sounds great and it's all radical
and it's cool and we're throwing that
away. Like I I want to watch this a year
a year in because I really I'm not a
conservative HR person. Anyone that
knows me, I'm like like go just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
go. But if you abolish all of it and
you're just like we're we're we're just
going to go and do stuff,
I guarantee you something will backfire.
like there there there does need to be
some thought, some consideration, some
thinking, some aiming before firing
because if you're just firing all the
time and launching [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and we're cool,
we have no HR. I I think that if that's
too much, you're going to you're going
to slow down your business. Actually,
the reverse will happen.
True. But you would also agree that even
with good HR in the building,
building businesses isn't without risk.
And so things are going to happen to
where like, you know, you're going to
get employee litigation, you're going to
have issues pop up. And so I I don't
know, like I hear you. I tend to agree.
You want someone to cover your blind
spots. You want someone that deeply
understands the business and rules
associated. You want someone that can
navigate in the gray area. I I tend to
agree that with Ryan that there will be
fewer of these people. They're not
entirely going away than we've seen in
the past and they will be less involved
on things that are low risk. That's what
I think is going to it's going to be
less about feeling maybe said more
succinctly, less about feelings
and much more about like are we actually
complying with the law. Yeah, I do agree
there'll be less and I do agree that the
mindset will need to shift to more, you
know,
ability to take risk and and all these
things, which I arguably think that's
already been happening, Nolan, for the
past 5 years. Like the most sought out
people leaders are ones that are already
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing that. So, you know,
whatever. I just I just think that if if
you completely abolish it and go rogue,
you're actually going to have more of
this stuff that will impact your
business. And I just I don't know. I
kind of I love it. Bolt has eliminated
its HR department. Eliminated. That is
not what has happened here. So, I don't
know. I just I'm calling a little bit of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the the clickbait here,
which is great and got a lot of views,
got a lot of comments, so it works.
We're talking about it.
It's not really true.
Yeah, it's not true and it it you know
again I will anchor to the the perfect
quote from you which is the work doesn't
go away right and you could ignore it
you can skip over it and I think a lot
of people are doing that now and finding
very little negative ramifications
but there is still like you manage
people they're complex beings it's
helpful to have a third party those
things are all true what form factor
does exist in the future future to
deliver that I think will be different
than what we've seen in the past.
Well, and we just had, you know, Brandon
on talking about AI. I just talked to
the founder yesterday morning like I
told you, but is launching like probably
hundreds of others AI coaching in the
moment in the line of work for these
people. So, I I do think things will
shift and we might become more of a team
of managing agents to help mitigate risk
in these people and spend more of our
time on the business. I mean, I I talk
about the business 60% of my day now.
It's like the job. Like, I don't even
think people ops will exist. Like, it's
something different. Like, when when
founder CEOs find this role, they they
don't even really want to label it.
Like, it's not really a label. Like,
it's just, oh, I work with Kelly. I work
with Nolan. Like, it's not an HR person.
It's something different. So, in that
sense, I I agree. But, I just it's just
just not true what he's writing. I'd
love him for him to come on. I'd love to
talk to him as you would too.
All right.
Thanks all.
