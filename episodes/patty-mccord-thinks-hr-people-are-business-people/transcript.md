# Patty McCord Thinks HR People are Business People

## Transcript

 
I'm not laying out the future as a
business partner I'm laying out the
future as a business leader HR people
are like what HR metrics do you think
are important like the p&amp;l a lot of
people don't do that like H how do you
do it and do you think HR leaders are
doing that well since you left Netflix
the point is it's to produce great teams
for the future not to make sure that
everybody that you hired in the past
gets a career path that's so counter to
what many HR people think today my CFO
at Netflix he said yeah I don't like the
way you are who you are that much but
you're Diva and like you're always right
about people the thing is bar we
actually have the same skills you know

people it's pattern

hey everybody Welcome to the first ever
HR Heretics podcast where we get into
the real talk of company construction
these are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and investors behind closed doors
today's episode features the one and
only Patty mcord but first of all
housekeeping we're your co-hosts I'm
Nolan church I was the head of talent at
door Das the chap people officer at
Carta and I'm currently the CEO of
Continuum and I'm Kelly dragovich I've
been an HR leader at companies including
GitHub looker Google into it yahoo hired
and most recently pendo there's got to
be more right Kelly I think you have
like 37 hits on your resume top of my
head did you miss any did I if I would
have had you as my adviser in my last
role I'd probably still be working there
I'm telling you I I wish I would have
had this 14 years ago when I started
Venture I really really do I would
listen every week religiously and then
probably reach out to those people to
ask questions which we answer our
audience should totally do that and they
should also hit us up on LinkedIn and

you helped us score yeah the best first
guest of all time Patty McCord she was
the chief Talent officer at Netflix she
worked with Reed Hastings the CEO for 25
years
how did you get to meet Patty to begin
with so everyone knew of Patty I knew of
Patty right I met Patty I believe it was
late 2013 for the first time it was
probably about 3 months after I started
GitHub and she walked up to me and said
you're still alive do you want to chat
and I said I am yes I do and from there
on Patty was just kind of than my bat
phone right so I I thought she'd be a
great first guest I thought you know
know the backbone of this show Nolan is
we tell the truth right we want to
unveil the things that are said in the
sea Suite in the boardroom in the VC
building that no one really gets to hear
about and some of those are
controversial some of those are hard to
hear some of those are difficult to
understand Patty's The Goat in my mind
when I think about HR Heretics I
literally think about Patty McCord in my
head and I think that's who a lot of our
listeners are going to want to model
their careers after model their partners
ship after model their board meetings
after I will tell you that I was a
little bit Star Struck during the
conversation uh I'd read her book I had
read the culture deck numerous times and
for me I always wanted to be like Patty
and the reason why she is the real deal
she says the things out loud that most
people are scared to say and when things
were really hard when I was a cheap
people officer and and head of
recruiting I would always look at what
Patty was doing to get some courage
she's like the most intent
designer of culture that I think we've
ever seen in Silicon Valley I agree for
that time the realness and the
directness of that deck and what they
stood for was unprecedented it was
against all the traditional ways of
running a company and they basically
swam Upstream yep one of the things that
listeners are going to love is the
relationship between Patty and Reed and
I found it so interesting that Reed did
not actually listen to Patty in the
beginning of their relationship she had
to earn that trust as time went on and I
thought it was fascinating because from
the outside in you would just think
everyone listens to Patty mccort so the
thing that always and still inspires me
about Patty is she just always plays
offense I think a lot of people in this
industry they play defense right they
plan for the worst they guard against
they mitigate they don't go get and
starting with that culture deck they
just played offense they weren't
Reckless but they weren't fearful and I
think that that gave a lot of people a
lot of confidence to try new things
without further Ado here's Nolan and I
talking to Patty let's get into it Patty
get into it I'm into it thanks so much
for spending time with us I actually
wanted to jump in on the culture deck
Cheryl Samberg called it one of the most
important documents in Silicon Valley
it's been 14 years I know shared 15
million times
looking back like what did you get wrong
if anything in the culture deck let's
back up a little bit um the culture I
didn't write it Reed and I didn't write
it we wrote it with the management team
at Netflix over a period of 10
years okay so if you go back and look at
it every chapter is built on the chapter
before so we rewrote those I think it's
nine of them six times in the time that
I was there early on in the company we
laid off a third of the company it was a
very cost intensive business because we
had to buy DVDs and stamps and envelopes
and the people to put them in there and
the more um successful we got the more
money we spent so we're were just
burning through our VC money right and
it was like God we got to cut cost what
do we
do we don't have anything to cut but
people and that Christmas DVD players
dropped to 99 bucks and you had one and
you had one we all had one under the
Christmas tree and under and the only
thing the only marketing we could do was
a in the Box was a coupon that said try
Netflix for free and our business
went so we were doing twice as much
business with the third as many people
and it was more fun huh and it turned
out that everybody had like a bigger job
and more
responsibility and our goal was not very
esoteric it was like don't
die right do not die and so what we
found was that that smaller team that
was really really focused on one thing
DVD by mail amazingly great was really
powerful so that's when we wrote the
chapter called um high performance uh
high performance for me as an HR
executive took maybe four or five years
to pull off because I had have a
recruitment team that would hire the
best people for the jobs that we had in
the future not for the best people that
we had in the jobs that we're now I had
to convince my CFO that a severance
agreement was better than a performance
Improvement
plan and I had to convince all the
lawyers of
that right so I basically started like
looking around every day and saying are
there things that we're doing that don't
matter are there things that we're doing
that slow us down and if it slows us
down and we only have so much time to be
successful then maybe we don't need to
do them yep okay so then we have a team
of high performance people then we're
like well what about um freedom and
responsibility and context not control
so if you go back through and you look
at the deck you'll see that if it wasn't
for the chapter before the chapter after
couldn't have happened so that's the
true story of the culture deck W um and
that's why I wrote my book after I left
Netflix was when I started Consulting
every startup founder would throw the
deck on the table and go we want to do
this I'm like all right you ready to get
started I've talked to a lot of Founders
and um HR folks or any any business
leader they're like the culture deck we
have to apply it right we'll just
overlay it onto this and we'll just copy
it yeah and just knowing you for about
 
deck a lot and I say it's not it's not
really a Playbook I mean hell it's not
even a playbook for them it's more like
a Journal like a journal of your life
that you rewrite and change and evolve
and build off and tweak as you learn
more by yourself yeah it's a really good
description of it this this this
Playbook and deck I just get hives when
people tell me that this is a freaking
Journal they didn't know we didn't write
it for anybody but us right so how we
used it at the beginning was Reed and I
would meet with whoever we hired in a
quarter who could usually fit in a room
and we'd go over the deck and say this
is what you can expect and sometimes in
those meetings I'd see people kind of go
oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be like they're not going to
last you know so so true story we're
driving to work one day and he goes you
know I met this woman last night who has
this really cool company called slid
share and they share PowerPoint
presentations online I'm like God that's
a great idea I wish IID thought of that
wonder what people are going to put out
there he's like well I put the deck out
yesterday I'm like you what cuz it's so
edgy right I'm like oh read you're going
to scare away you're going to scare away
all my you know my potential candidates
and he goes only the ones we don't want
exactly and it changed the way we
interviewed the next day so now I wasn't
interviewing you to see if you had all
the right acronyms on your resume now I
was saying tell me about the stuff
you've actually delivered yep right tell
me about um how what what you've done
wrong that you would do differently
again right so it just
it created a conversation that was
really important for us to be clear
about who we were and we were not saying
everybody should it's funny that people
are like you know I want to do this like
like you well but you can if you're in a
medical device company you can if you're
in a manufacturing organiz I mean but it
also gives candidates the opportunity to
opt in or opt out yeah and have real
convers you know I remember when we
could finally interview people from who
had offers from Facebook or Google or
you know the cool companies and um
they'd say can I work on anything that I
want I'm like no we we rent
 
movies it's not Google yeah we're we're
not everything to everybody we do this
one thing and if you're not really
interested in this problem then that's
okay there's lots of opportunity at
Google to play Devil's Advocate on the
culture deck right lots of twists and
turns the next chapter is written on the
first one and you all were just super
Dynamic you moved fast you switched I
mean very quick how did you take the
employees along with that because I can
see right no and we know this they love
to complain what are you lunatics doing
I don't know what's going on you don't
know what you're doing there's so much
chain my favorite stories it's in the
book you know they're expecting a ton
how did you take them along or did you
even freaking care this guy said to me
goes I don't think that management
understands that everything's changing
and it's not like it used to be and we
used to know each other's names and we
used to know what everybody was doing I
mean I don't think management
understands I'm like well I'm a vice
president and I report to the CEO so
let's call me management okay you and I
have had this conversation seven times
and I've had it four times with Reed so
I'm gonna say part A of your sentence is
false management hears you we understand
do you know why things are different why
like because we're
successful I said do you know what we
want to be when we grow up he's like I
like a global
Corporation you could tell he was
like I'm like it's okay you won't be
here because you're a startup guy and I
mean then that's you know the and the
thing was that
um we literally made it up and so
because we made it up we could try
something go that was stupid let's not
do that anymore or that has promised
let's see if we can work on that but
people have a hard time with that change
like and you hear it all the time to
your point you like Kelly and I hear it
all the time as well in the CPO job how
did you guys think about it did you care
one thing I'll jump in and I'll let
Patty one thing that I love about her
leadership is just just the human aspect
of it like literally saying I don't know
or we don't know what we're doing it's
changing I mean I've never seen
employees just stop and Nod as fast as
you just saying we don't know get over
it right like you know if you want a
predictable company you should be at IBM
yeah they respond to that yeah I mean
but like yeah and and if you don't want
to be part of the change so so I have a
couple of sayings I tell people so when
they come and say you know management
made this stupid decision and I don't
agree with it I say okay there I have
two questions to ask you and the second
one's more important one is if you were
in management what decision would you
have made more importantly if you're in
management what information would you
want to have to make the best
decision so you teach people how to use
the scientific method you teach people
that you're expecting them to
think right could you I don't care about
your opinion I really do not problem
solve problem
finders worth nothing problem solvers o
weight and gold right so it's but but
you have to model that behavior and you
have to teach that behavior and I think
it's one of the things that's really
hard right now with our distributed
Workforce I mean I love remote work and
we can talk about how amazing those
things are but there's part of like
seeing great leadership in action that
inspires people to be great
leaders right you know and those don't
have to be very complex
things leadership and action is an
ingenious um this guy like did you see
that I ask a lot of questions in the
development meeting I'm like I did and
all of them were kind of
dumb like so you asking questions is not
very noteworthy yeah right you didn't
have any suggestions for how we could do
it better yeah and so that's kind of
leads me to um feedback right but most
people think that feedback means telling
people something negative in a nice way
so that they won't feel
bad right that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sandwich right
nice thing the bad thing the nice thing
and that and what it really means is if
you're really um if the person you're
giving feedback to knows that your
objective on giving you feedback is to
make you better to make the company
better to make the customer happier then
you're much more willing to listen but
you're not willing to listen to Just the
feedback the part of it that people Miss
is like and here's what you could do
differently and here's what the effect
would be and here's what the effect of
the way you're communicating is now the
other part is like we totally so um
feedback is like as a parent you know
guilt tripping that bad thing you did as
bad thing don't do that again shame you
should feel bad shame you should feel
shame when you do that again I talked to
my therapist about it with our kids
right now she said shame embarrassment
the two things that I'm doing I'm like
okay no but you're going to do it again
right I mean it's just so ineffective
and if you think about effective
feedback it's when I say Kelly thanks
for speaking up in this meeting about
that because you've been complaining to
me about it for months but you've never
said it out loud in front of everybody
else and so and thanks for your
suggestion on how to do it better do
that again and you will do that today
 
Netflix did feedback was once a quarter
the team would get AC around a table and
then everyone would give that person
feedback I'm sure that's like a little
bit overdramatized no but I mean that's
one of the ways we did it I mean I
probably tried 20 different ways when I
was there I never got it right
interesting um I and I
don't I don't know what the answer is I
really don't but I do know that the
closer to in the moment it is the more
effective it is yeah uh and also that
um you can be just straight with people
and that people can hear anything if
it's
true right it's that sugar coating that
we put on it you know
you could have better interpersonal
relationships with cross functional
teams if you worked on better
communication and you're like what the
hell is she talking about yeah what does
that mean yeah and so with real examples
in real time especially in the moment
then that matters so I tried that do you
do it in the moment of like like in a
group setting or do we grab this person
after the fact like it depends on how
entrenched they
are right it's really really great to
grab this person in the moment and do it
in front of everybody else and they're
like oh my God can you believe what she
said to him interesting and she
lived right because when I was at sign
they'd be
like career limiting moment right there
we just saw that
one hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
hey everybody your co-host Nolan here

right now or don't know how to solve a
problem I get it scaling is hard so
check out Continuum in the description
below ping me on LinkedIn if you have
any questions or head to join continuum.
comom well this is interesting this is
kind of spicy we were talking about this
in the backyard before here I have a
hypothesis it's not
about you're how you're doing it Netflix
it's great and but people have trauma
people like right I mean Nolan this is a
t-shirt of his the 10 average 10 year is
 
for like highly talented people
especially in Silicon Valley we move 18
months 2 years you move companies and
bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can happen and you have trauma
and you have scars and so you kind of
have to like retrain these people that
it's okay to get feedback you're not
going to get burned or you are going to
get burned because different companies
different Founders different leadership
teams have these different cultures and
people are trying to move around and
adap to them I think it's deeper what
you're talking about is deeper because
that idea that your tenure in a company
should last longer than 18 months is
complete
lie and it's been a lie since the 60s I
mean really seriously are we still
talking about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I agree right
the the career pathing stuff it's like
the world moves really fast 18 months is
long enough to learn a ton of stuff um
you know bad stuff happens to all of us
whether we want it to or
not if you're 18 months in any job
that's exactly the same as what they
hired you to do you should probably not
expect a lot in the
future okay and that's and lots of
people don't and that's perfectly okay
right but you got to choose a company
that's going to have you have the same
 
and over and over again yes most
companies in the current world want you
to have pretty fresh experience right
and so you can I was at Netflix for God
forever right 14 years but I always tell
people like I I used to tell read the
CEO of Netflix I'm like okay here's the
deal with me I kind of think of him as
degrees and after between four and five
years I get bored and then I kind of
start making trouble and then you know
then you got to let me go so he's I'm
like so you should know that and so we
get to my four and a half years and
we're going from DVD to the technology
of streaming it's like oh new company so
so a lot of times you can have that 18
months of
experience that's why I'm such an
advocate
of so now that I've done this for so
long the job of management is to build
great teams that produce amazing work on
time with quality that satisfies the
customer
done that's it that's all right but the
point is it's to produce great teams
for the future not to make sure that
everybody that you hired in the past
gets a career
path that's so counter to what many HR
people think today I know and push
internally to CEOs yeah they want a
career path they want levels they want
it nice and structured in this box and
you're basically just saying like it's
not true it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean it's it
has always has been and it always so so
I do talking Canada before the pandemic
there's 500 CEOs and there are HR people
in the audience right and I say raise
your hand if you're in the job that you
had when you graduated from University
CEOs how many hands go up zero right
like okay raise your hands if you and
your HR partner um think that the most
important measurement uh for people is
 
retention 500 people raise their hands
I'm like is that that seem fair to
you it wasn't true for you but it's true
for all of them it's just it's a crazy
metric right it's a crazy metric
and it's just it doesn't work that way I
it's just if you're successful your
company will change do you hear me if
you're successful your company will
change and people will leave and new
people will come in people will grow
people will renew people will leave and
start new new companies and buy your
product and some will come back right
that's right and the people that are
there will be fine they'll be fine we
can talk to them as adults about change
I mean another thing I've been talking
about a lot since I've left is
um if you can wrap your head around
creating a company that's a great place
to be
from let me say it again a great place
to be from so that your job as a leader
is to create um resume Worthy uh Pro you
know projects and products and right
then then you take that with you forever
yeah why do you think um folks are still
like grasping on to this retention what
is it are they sced we're scared yeah I
mean you know you get older and you have
families you have obligations and you
want predictability I mean we're humans
we want to know our cave is going to be
there and that you know the woolly
mammoth will be there for supper I mean
whatever it is right and so th that's
not illogical to not want security it's
just not true to promise it to people es
especially in a hypergrowth business
especially for entrepreneurs I
mean you know I'm lucky because I have
been part of a couple of really
successful startup companies but I am
not the norm you aren't Kelly you guys
are I mean you know the Norm is like
well I went to hell in a hand basket
because it was either a great idea that
was a feature or it was a great idea
that's part of something else or it was
a great idea that with bigger resources
and complexity then you can grow it in a
way you couldn't do it on your own
so I mean that's the norm and so what we
don't tell people early in their career
is the
truth right yeah you know it's highly
unlikely you will join this firm and be
here for the rest of your life but it's
highly likely that every couple of years
you're going to be in a significantly
different
job I want to talk about your
relationship with Reed yeah how long did
you guys know each other or have known
each other Reed Hastings the CEO of
former CEO of Netflix he retired last
year let's see my relationship with Reed
um I met Reed because when I was at a
company called Borland one of our EX
tives left and he had a lot of options
on what to do next he was going to
either be a professor at Harvard or he
was going to join a startup and he
joined this startup and I was coaching
him on you know what choices to make and
I said well why' you choose this one he
said because I think the CEO is really
talented and I think he has a lot of
potential so I was pretty frustrated
because the company wasn't going very
well so I I I cold called you are you
old enough to remember star 69 yes right
when somebody call you do star 69ine it
would dial the phone back right so um I
did star 69 and Reed's sister was the uh
receptionist she answered the phone and
I'm like hi my name is Patty McCord can
I speak to Reed Hastings she puts me
through know me right I said hi you
don't know me but I'm going to be your
next HR person and I'd really like to
come and meet you and he's
like what who who are you you cold
outbound read amazing yeah
so thought be a star 69 what year is
this this is I don't know 80s 90s early
 
anyway um I got an interview with him
and um in the interview I was he said
something about you know what's your HR
philosophy and I'm from Sun right so I
speak fluent HR read I believe that
every employee should be able to reach
out with their personal goals and
objectives and align them with the core
competencies of the business business in
the organization and find a way to you
know just HR Bingo HR Bingo man I just
float and he looks at me he goes you
didn't throw engagement in there oh I
had them all I had them all engagement
empowerment I had and I believe that
employees should be empowered and he's
like what the hell are you talking about
I mean we sell software I don't
understand what you people like do you
have an original thought in your head
and I said you don't know me and he's
like yeah well I'm not gonna if you're
going to keep answering so we get in
this big fight and then they called me
back and um and it was because uh the
other person they just didn't like it
very much just limited option came down
a limited options process of elimination
so yeah so uh so a pipeline of two now
and and my background is recruiting
right so I'm this is the first time I've
ever been like a real HR generalist and
a Prof professional so I go in I'm like
hi re I want to talk to you about the
structure of the organization where
we're going he's like yeah um not I
didn't ask you why don't you go away
like we got we got work to do and I
really don't need you to help me do that
so I told you outside like so we had
this endless series of conversations
over years where I'd say you know if you
had asked me what you should do in this
situation I would have said probably not
what you did and I would suggest
something different and he would say
note that I didn't ask you and then over
time he would come in and go I did
something you're not going to like so I
might as well tell you before you give
me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it and then after a while
it'd be like I have this idea what do
you
think and because you know here you guys
know this you know how we get our
reputation we're right more often than
we're
wrong and somebody said to me one time
um oh my CFO at Netflix he said yeah I
don't like the way you are who you are
that much but you're diva
and like you're always right about
people right you and when we interview
somebody and I disagree with you you
always turn out to be right and I'm like
well first of all let me just bathe in
the that you called me a diva for a
minute not that you're right I was right
just like you know who because I mean we
fought all the time and I said do you
know the thing is Barry we actually have
the same skills you know yours is with
numerals mine's with people it's
patterned
recognition right so I don't care what
they say on their resume I care about
what they've actually done what they've
actually delivered what's you know and
you want to talk about like what rank
were they at
Harvard which has nothing to do with the
job we're hiring them to do right so
that's I that's our strength right and
so where we get the respect that we want
is not you know demanding a seat at the
table
yeah I want what is nature haven't se
the table I'm like just earn
it right have the table be set and
somebody say oh my God we should get
Kelly but in your case you were actually
like okay not being listened to and at
least in the beginning yeah but I had to
be right right right right I mean I I
made a policy for with myself that I
would never say I told you so because I
would never have
to
and you know what most of the time it's
like you know this this person is not
telling you the truth what do you mean
he's not telling me the truth I mean you
think he's lying I'm like pretty sure
there's so many HR people though Patty
that don't want to let Founders make
mistakes and I found that that's the
only way people learn especially
Founders yeah the whole let them
fail you know I I remember after I left
Netflix I was Consulting to a company um
um this is when I was working Brandon
Street that was back in the day of the
last.com boom right everybody had the
cool offices on Brandon Street I'm you
know I don't really do the side streets
I only work Brandon and I go in and this
guy the the it's you know a San
Francisco office it's all full of brick
and and there's nine pool tables I'm
like geez you know you could put a lot
of engineers in
here that take the space of the N pool
table so so I say to the CEO I say um
what do you want for your company right
what's what's your vision he's like
we're going to be a well-oiled machine
we're gonna we're going to deliver we're
going to produce we're going to have
great solutions for our customers we're
going to be just a team that's operating
at maximum like wow that is that's great
okay so let's say you and I are playing
pool and we have an exec you we have an
leadership meeting at two and it's 5 to
two and I'm about to pretty much kick
your ass like what happens he goes
you're not going to kick my ass we're
going to stay here until I beat you I'm
like
uh-huh you want to have a well Machine
be on
 
time it's that simple yeah right you
know if you say you will then do and
people are you know in all my years of
doing this you guys know this for sure
we're just
Ducks we imprint on leadership and
that's why you know your question was
was why don't we let Founders fail we
don't have to let them fail but we have
to give them a heads up that you know
this this has consequences right this
decision this act that you're doing has
consequences and I'm not the fand you
are yeah right I mean it's you're the
boss so you're laying out the future lay
you're laying out the future the future
you know we talked about earlier I'm not
laying out the future as a business
partner I'm laying out the future as as
a business
leader from a specific angle from where
I sit I can see HR people are like what
HR metrics do you think are important
like the p&amp;l right
Revenue yeah right and so if every
quarter you have a executive management
offsite and everybody puts together you
know a slideshow of what they're going
to do and you notice that you're three
quarters in and they haven't done
it like okay there's something wrong
it's probably people
but you don't have to go light I don't
think so I don't think you're I think
you're unhappy it's not whether or not
you're unhappy you're just not
delivering yeah so what's what's going
on in there yeah the relationship with
these Founders just working with a ton
of them and you two both of you and
talking with even more than I've worked
with it's a tricky relationship right
especially in this HR people whatever we
call ourselves now what do we call
ourselves Nolan I have no idea anymore
we're people people in this job because
it it has to be a balance between that
business side and the relationship side
you can't be it's not a balance Kelly
it's it's yeah I guess it is but but a
lot of people don't do that like H how
do you do it and do you think HR leaders
are doing that well since you left
Netflix the last 12 years how has it
shifted well I mean I've seen things
shift so dramatically since I've left
right so when I first left it was Chief
happiness officers and all that crazy
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean and then there's the
pandemic like oh my God are Tech Bros
cooking their own
breakfast how's that going to happen
like how are they going to get their own
cereal
yep and then because of the pandemic we
literally had a a vision into people's
lives and realize oh wow they have
children they have spouses they have
obligations that because we can see it
in front of us and you know up until
then we all believed that there were two
personas that each of us had the work
person and the home
person and we we told ourselves we could
be two different
people right it was only when things
cracked or thing you know your dad dies
or your kid gets sick or something like
that it's only when the crack opens and
you're like well I'm a mom to I'm a dad
I'm a daughter I'm a grandmother
Whatever It Is by the way I do this too
yeah and now we could see like into
everybody's literally into their
bedrooms usually right or their laundry
rooms and see that they got other things
happening at home and so I think that's
a really really healthy thing that's
happened to work and I don't think that
like I get talk called all the time to
talk about the future of work you and I
have talked about this it's like it's
now what are we waiting
for and if you go back you'll be so
sorry it's just you but it seems like
we're getting softer like we've gone
through a lot of adversity and it it
feels like we've come out on the other
end like really soft from where I say
yeah you're in the real world and I'm
not anymore so I you know I still I I
get to pontificate all the time it's
like I was talking to somebody on
podcast the other day I'm like you know
I love this this place I have in the
world now where I'm like this Diva Guru
right and I people like oh you're so
Innovative I never innovated anything I
just stopped doing stupid
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you could rewind 20 years today
and come back in and hang out with Nolan
and I and all the cooks we hang out with
yeah in the current situation would you
why or why not would you do it again in
this environment you know
um probably
not successfully because I'm such a hard
ass but yeah I mean you know um so every
podcast ends up with the lightning
questions we're gonna ask you a bunch of
questions not this one and you're gonna
and you're gonna pretend like you didn't
know them and so I want you to act like
it's spontaneous right and one of them
is what would you tell your younger self
and I after I thought about it for a
while I realized I would tell I wish I
knew how good I was
then right I didn't know that I was good
at what I did until I made six figures
and I had a VP title then I was like oh
no I'm I'm kind of a pro now but I was a
I was a great
recruiter yeah you know and um and the
reason why I was a great recruiter was I
really loved what people do for a living
I mean I loved going into the robotics
lab watching people build little tiny
arms of I mean I thought that was cool
right and
um so that relationship between what we
do as professionals and what the other
people do in our companies to make our
companies successful should be like
muscles it's we're not outside of the
company we're not business partners we
are in the business right what I so I
walk uh I'm at Netflix and I'm walking
in the lunchroom Reed and I and I see a
bunch of Engineers there talking amongst
themselves and then they they're shis
sping That's What I Call talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in
a
whisper that's so good Shing shis Bry
and then they stop talking and Reed says
um they're afraid of you I'm like no
they're not he goes yes they are you
control their title their salary whether
or not they work there I mean what does
it feel like and I'm like it feels like
I have a lot of power and he goes yeah
what does that feel like I'm like what's
it feel like
Reed this this same thing so I sit down
with those Engineers I'm like let's see
why are you just bring oh my salary was
just released on Edgar the day before
because I'm a section 16 officer I'm
like can you guys believe how much money
I make they're
like I'm like I can't write a line of
code you two of you have phds and math I
mean like seriously like why on God's
Earth is this chick making this kind of
money and they're like I'm like because
I'm in charge of making sure we got the
right teams in the right place at the
right time and um so that means having
the right people here finding the right
people having the wrong people you know
people that move on move on with dignity
and Grace and um and I I really hear you
about your education and your expertise
so which one of you wants to go do the
exit interview with the VP that I'm
about to do which you one anyone anyone
anyone want want to do
that so but it's that SC so let's go
back to what HR people do we do all this
behind the scenes stuff on compensation
and scope and reach of job and levels
and all that stuff that everybody wants
to know but they don't really know it we
don't really tell them we don't really
tell them that the Radford survey we
used to figure out their compensation is
two years old yeah it's an art and it's
and that and that the way we do it is
the way we've done it since
 
thousand compensation people one
time me with comp people my eyes just
went wide yeah I know I was just like oh
my God so I was like okay the doors are
closed I'm one of you I get it okay
here's what I want you to do raise your
right hand everybody go home and Rite
some checks and fix AAL pay for God's
sake how hard is this
like it's
not this is not you know brain surgery
this is called a spreadsheet that says
average male salary average female
salary if it's different write a check
make it simple okay and then realize go
look in the mirror and realize that this
inequity you made it
yourself but wasn't Netflix like that
because Netflix was always uh top pay
for top performance and it was
individual markets yes right and so with
individual markets you're going to have
inequities and so depends I mean I can't
say anything about when I left yeah but
when I was there one of the questions
that was um ejected from any interview
was what are you currently
making okay okay so I no longer allowed
people to ask that in an interview I I I
do remember one of the things about
getting a raise was uh one of the best
ways to do it was to go get another
offer yeah I used to say I I I sent a
note to the whole company one time and
I'm like okay just let me be clear I
know that head hunters are calling you I
know that we're popular I know that
people want you guys to come okay so
just do me a favor before you say no
thanks be sure you say how much and come
tell
me because that's how I I'll know what
Market is I think that the the real
Intel around pay competitive pay
especially in the Bay Area is in
recruitment it's just a hard I again
that's another one of those
never really cracked but like this comp
piece like we just it's one slice of so
many slices of The Damp pie it's an
important slice no no I'm saying it's a
hard job is what I'm saying no but but
but it's all the the this is what I
learned it's the whole thing you can't
chunk it up like we do in HR well comp
does this and employee relations does
this and the benefits people do this and
that da d d and we all think we have
these separate correct it's all the same
thing so so I'm Co I'm on the board of a
company that does year and performance
bonuses right so I'm meeting with the
CEO the CFO the chief people officer
after they've done two
months of calculations figuring out what
the performance bonus is going to be at
the end of the year right and it's based
on company performance and stock
performance and I'm like okay before we
get started talking about the
intricacies of the bonus program which I
I I mean I think I'm a pretty smart
person but honestly I'm kind of Twisted
about it have you ever not paid it what
do you mean I'm like so seven years have
you ever not paid the annual performance
bonus well I don't know that that's
relevant I'm like it's totally relevant
have you ever not paid
it no I'm like okay so it's not a
performance
bonus the only thing you have to do to
earn this this bonus is be employed on
December 31st so it's actually retention
bonus so has nothing to do with
performance all these calculations that
you're doing end up that people always
get paid this bonus right and like so
and this is you know five 10 years ago
in San Francisco I'm like and so your
average employee is a 28-year-old single
man uh who's living in the most
expensive city in
America why don't you just let him pay
more
 
rent just but it's so simple to say but
it's like you guys have Netflix did this
years ago this is not like a New Concept
but it still hasn't been modeled like
yeah why not you guys tell me I mean
you're you're in the world like why do
we keep doing this stupid stuff it's
just because we always have because
people always do because partly because
I think that that um to be honest with
you I think that VCS typically come out
of business and when they advise their
companies on what best practices are
they think it's what they did yeah so
best that the term best practices is
another one that I just hate hate hate
right it's like it just means what
everybody else does yes that's all it
means well ironically the best practice
term is hindering us from changing right
I mean if you want to I mean Netflix is
one of them right it takes courage to be
that first one to do something different
I.E not best practice potentially yeah
but they were so successful Patty wrote
a book there's a culture deck that's
been out for 15 years like it worked
yeah but you know it's still not being
model it's it's
not look so I'm talking to a friend of
mine who had my job after I left a
couple times after I left Jessica Neil
and I was like oh thank God we don't
have our jobs now because like in the
middle of the writer strike yeah right
I'm like this would be gnarly
compensation but then we're both like o
this would be
juicy because what they want is they
want residuals based on reruns and
that's not how it works anymore right so
they want to go back to the way it
always was and get paid the way writers
always have but that's not the way it is
now so both of us were
like that would be really hard and
really fun so you you know it's about
getting people in our profession that
really think like innovators yeah and
that's what's missing that's what's
missing that's what's really missing I
totally agree with you Patty so how do
we fix that I mean you see more Business
Leaders going to these jobs is that part
of it yeah part of it I mean I see a lot
of operations people going into HR now
and they're they're pretty good about
that they understand it um they're not
risk averse either these people are
going in and ripping stuff up yeah and
because they've been victims of it for
so so long I mean they've been to be
well to be
styi they can't do their own jobs
because they got to wait for all this
other stuff that doesn't make any
difference and you know I I'll I'll say
this I maybe leave you with this I
learned everything that I did from
product
managers and from
Engineers right so what I learned from
them was you know nobody at Netflix said
let's make your remote control smidge
better right let's make it so you don't
have a 100 channels you have 12 I mean
whatever Ian we didn't we're like
rethink the whole thing um a great
example is we knew um that you would
binge 20 years ago because as soon as
box sets came out everybody would want
to load up their queue with box sets and
watch them right so it's like boy if we
could ever do this
um yeah it's hot in here if if we could
ever do this people would love it like
what if you could just keep fast
forwarding and watch things right so
between that knowledge of consumer
Behavior and the ability to technically
do it was probably 10 years but what but
what I learned from them was they would
reverse
engineer I think it's risk averse people
are scared people are scared to do
things differently and we were talking
at David hran about this and David said
something really interesting is like
when I was younger I used to be a tad to
like my thing uh like this was the thing
I was going to do and I had you know
every six months I'd go through like a
different thing yeah versus like coming
at it from a first principal's
perspective and thinking about it as
like if we're trying to build a
hypergrowth business and these are the
things we're doing how do we get the
best people in the B building and how do
we keep them here you know I I um here's
how I did it I did it just like the
product managers did I would I would say
when I got rid of paid time off right I
didn't get rid of paid time off I got
rid of tracking paid time off right and
I stood on a chair back in the day when
I could stand on a chair and talk to
everybody in the company and I said look
my HR friends tell me I'm out of my mind
that this is just going to be terrible
either everybody's going to work all the
time or nobody's going to work at all um
my lawyer friends and enemies tell me
this is insane we're going to be sued
because men are going to take more time
off than women or you know you whatever
it's going to be discriminatory and said
you know and all that could be true
these are smart people who I really
respect but to be honest with you I
don't see why anybody on my team needs
to keep track of when you're at work
right I really think that this is best
managed at the team level so we're going
to try it for six months and if they're
right and I'm wrong then we'll do what
everybody else does and call it best
practices yeah it's a great question I
just don't know
why more of this doesn't happen but why
don't you know back to like when we were
talking earlier why why don't
Founders require more from us well I was
going to say a lot of it is the the
disposition the personality right the
risk aversion and frankly the dislike of
HR crap in these companies really what
you just said though is run it like an
experiment right right and I think if we
started to frame these things more as
experiments they become a lot less scary
to go test totally you know and I'm like
and I know you guys are worried about it
too cuz yeah you know I'm not I'm not
just talking to anybody I'm talking to
like yeah we had Wilson sansini was our
lawyers and um sansini gets on the phone
he's like um Larry sonini says Reed and
Patty I forbid this this is the worst
idea you've ever had wow you absolutely
should not do this and we said thanks
 
Larry it launches
Monday you know and and it was really we
learned a ton from it I mean when I left
it actually went went South you know
there are people like hey by the way
wife's pregnant um I'll see you next
year like people like so we didn't put
enough structure around it to say hey by
the way we're paying you an annual
salary so you kind of need to do years
worth of work it takes courage to do
that but it's you know if you run it as
an experiment you learn along the way
you make changes nothing set in stone
here's my big start there's two things
really really important
adults yep right these aren't high
schoolers that you're employing these
are adults they have mortgages they have
car payments they have children they
have mothers it's like so these are
adults so do not put anything in place
that treats them like kindergarteners
and the second one is be a great place
to be
from so Patty I want to talk about the
topic of
compartmentalization in this job big
word but the the the real deal of is we
see a lot we've seen a lot we see a lot
we will see more a lot comes at us a lot
of personal stuff just heavy heavy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
how do you how have you compartmentalize
that a couple of
things so my two rules for
termination were you couldn't be
surprised and you had to keep your
dignity and so when a manager would come
in and say I've had it with Kelly I told
her one more time she does this again
she's out of here she did it one more
time I want to fire her and I'm like
great why don't you wait here and let me
go ask Kelly how she's
doing well actually I told her that in
our oneon-one in May I'm like well it's
October so what do you think she's gonna
tell me and then I go meet with you and
you say Shan I mean you know he does
this two three times a year and he gets
really mad at me and he yells at me and
I cry and you know it's something about
communication and I don't know what it
is and so I avoid
him for a couple of months and then he's
back and we do it again so to be honest
with you I don't really know right and
so that part of it is where we can be
really useful in coaching people about
how to have real conversations with
people about their performance right and
so that you you aren't surprised right
it's not
it's not something that happens to you
out of the Clear Blue Sky you've had
conversations that say maybe this isn't
going to work
out the other one is
um we talked about this a little bit
earlier we're not business partners
we're business people and it's a
business that we're running and you know
people would come in and tell me that
you know spill their hearts and souls
I'm like oh God sounds horrible like do
you have a mom do you have a sister do
you have a best friend because I'm not
anyone one of those people like I'm an
officer of the company and So like um
sounds really sucky but I'm not sure
it's something that we need to resolve
here isn't that counter though to bring
your whole self to
work yes but you're bringing your whole
self to
work right you're not bringing your
whole self to have all of your
relationships there I I I will tell you
though I've changed my mind about this a
little bit right so um the whole team
not family thing I I really really mean
that I really do mean that I think that
we have opportunities to do things with
people at work that we have nowhere else
in our lives right it's different than a
family it's different I mean we there
are wonderful things we do with our
families but we can't do at work and
there's wonderful things we do at work
that we can't do with our families
because we just respect each other so
what's interesting is now that I look
back on it and if I wrote my book I
might change that to say um they're not
your family but it doesn't mean you
can't make enduring lifelong friends
with the people at work it doesn't mean
you can't love them right that you can
have incredible respect for somebody
else but when you're together at work
you're together at work to do work and
so I don't know that I don't know how I
deal with that now I really don't yeah
it I mean it's a slippery slope I don't
know Nolan if you've experienced this
but
the the line between helping to coach
right through communication or awareness
or these things that I kind of call them
above the line things all of a sudden
three minutes later you're like whoa how
did we get to where we're at now it's
very personal it's very high stakes it's
very psychologist psychiatrist like how
do you know when that happens I think a
lot I think a lot of it's a hard thing
to do and if you don't if you can't
recognize that line it can backfire
pretty bad a lot of HR Pros get into the
therapist Zone I mean what's your take
on that Patty and they get their energy
from that I think it's a really slippery
slope and I think it's detrimental to
everybody involved right unless you're a
therapist a train I mean this is a
profession this isn't like oh you know
what let's be part-time therapists we'll
be friends and we'll be co-workers and
I'll be your therapist and it's like no
right you want somebody who really knows
what they're doing to deal with this and
most of us aren't trained to do that and
and I think
where we go
bad or wrong is that you start off
thinking I can really help this person
and then you're just over your head over
your head especially timec consuming
very timec consuming yeah because that
person thinks you're their therapist and
they want to be with you all the time
and they want to tell you about all the
and and you know you go into that
inappropriate
Zone really fast really fast the other
thing is um you know the I guess the way
one of the ways that I've worked my way
around it is um I'm not your therapist
I'm not your mom and I'm not your
boss you have a boss right so you know
my favorite one of my favorite phrases
is what did Nolan say when you told him
that like well I I'm like if you can't I
I couldn't say that to him I'm like you
said it to
me
yeah so what if we use we can practice
using different words if you think he'll
listen to you better but you just said
it to me to me so I mean that's a way I
think that we can turn around the the
therapist role to the coaching role
which is um this is not an issue between
you and me and I'm not going to fix it
for you but this is where it gets hard
in this job right because this job to
some employees that's why you're here
you're a therapist I I should spend six
hours with you a day if I want to to a
founder and a leadership team and a and
a board you're there to help the company
make money and grow it's a
misclassification almost like an
impossible thing sometimes and this is
where I see a lot of HR leaders get
pinched it's just no win there's no way
you win that one I mean you see that's
what you're saying though right it's
just a misclassification and you have to
have a hard line on what we do and what
we don't do and people need to
understand that and I think that's where
a lot of the gray area lies today is
like employees don't really know what
the job of HR is yeah and I mean that's
fair I was going to say and that's why
you got to go out and say that right a
lot of HR teams they kind of hang out
behind the curtain they do their thing
well what are you what are you doing
back there all day
exactly yeah I mean so it's it's part of
our job to be straight with them and
tell them you know um like I said I'm an
officer of the
company that's my job it comes first you
talked earlier about um the the early
days of Netflix and the intensity and
the the fighting right the the the hey
the CFO read I just feel like to Nolan's
Point earlier about the the industry
getting soft I feel like that doesn't
really happen anymore like one little
argument H should I be here should they
be here A whole total failure wouldn't I
no but like what happened to For Better
or For Worse we're in this we're going
to kick and scratch sometimes who cares
I feel like the stakes are just so yeah
know Reed I said to Reed I'm like oh I
hear you're one of the white guys who
wants everybody to come to back back to
work come back in the office and he's
like you know why do you always have to
put white guy in front of it I'm like
I'm just saying it's real and I'm like
why why do you want everybody to come
back to work and he said we're too nice
on Zoom um and and he said I can't see
he said for example I couldn't see you
giving me the stink
eye you know side eye like are you crazy
in Zoom because you would never do that
right where if we were in the same room
I'd be like oh what do you have to say
Patty it turns out when you say
something we might actually have a real
discussion yeah and so that's what he
said he's like um you know we don't
debate right we don't dis we don't argue
in the most positive way and when people
ask me about like what do I miss about
working now it's that like I miss going
into a meeting and being like I am so
right I am so right just wait till these
people hear my argument I'm going to so
I feel like it used to be just a part of
the job and now it happens it's like a
thing and then you know when people talk
me out of it it's a complaint and I
don't know what's going onr complt if
you're seeing this Nolan but the softest
out there I'm like we're brothers and
sisters we're going to fight we're going
to scream it doesn't mean you need to
leave or I should lose my job or vice
versa like it just is it's the
weaponization of HR it's just like when
we get in a new argument Patty and then
I don't like it I'm going to go tell my
hrbp that Patty was mean or Patty you
know wasn't listening to me and it's
just like I I just these are human
relationships it's business there's a
difference between our role as coaches
that's different than a role as a
therapist and the coach says you know
when I let's use my example I just use
well you just told me however if you
tell Nolan what you just told me he'll
probably squash you like a bug so let's
find a way that you can use different
words to get what you just told me
across right that might be so that he
can listen right and because you feel
unhappy is not a legit result right it
and and so you have to teach people to
go and because you're unhappy you're not
very motivated and you're not working
very hard and you're you know um now
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy yeah now
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy and
you're not actually doing anything and
now mad at you cuz you're not doing and
was
like like how do we stop the cycle stop
the cycle how do we create a healthy
work environment and
also I don't know how you guys do this
I'm just mystified it's
like you you know how do you tell people
sometimes you just don't agree and
that's cool yeah disagree and commit the
the Bezos quote I love is will you
gamble with me uhhuh like I love that
quote and and I honestly feel like more
people should say it because we don't
really know what's going to happen none
of us can predict the future but we also
can't continue to be so upset when
someone does something different than
what we want yeah and you know the other
one is the the results if you constantly
focus on the results mentality which is
you could be right and I could be wrong
let's see how it plays out and
remember okay and if more than once you
come to me where I I think you're being
a big fat whiner and it turns out that
you're right then I probably should have
listened to you
more right but maybe the way you
communicated with me wasn't a way where
I could put a you know put a marker on
what I perceive you to be whining about
versus what it does to the business or
the team or the group I mean it's that
yeah it's that results
orientation that I think that where HR
people get in the slippery up for sure
yeah last one for you Patty is you've
been out of the game for a little while
now I think a lot of HR people are
really tired right now I bet do you miss
it though do you miss do you miss being
in the
arena um I miss being in the executive
Arena I don't miss being in the HR Arena
as much um but because I haven't been
for 20
years you know I mean the whole time I
was at Netflix I wasn't the HR person
and I was a business person and I've
been gone 12 years so that's 20
something years so
um I think it's a challenge for people
now but I think it's an incredible
opportunity I mean we don't have to go
back we can create our own future it's
right here in front of us right now we
can do all kinds of experiments I mean
that's you know when people say uh I
think I told you this earlier oh we
could we'd love what to do what you did
at Netflix but we can't because we're
regulated we can't CU our CFO w we can't
cuz we're in Europe we can't cuz we
couldn't possibly work from
home and then 48 hours later the whole
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] world worked from home right and
it's like that muscle was always there
yep yeah it was always there and so now
you
know and and I think that to be fair
about how people are responding right
now it's
that the pandemic was so emotional and
so hard and there was so much psychology
to it to be honest with you right it's
like you know my my son will tell me he
he and his friends will say um you know
we're not so much worried about us we're
in our 30s late 30s it's the people who
are new to work and you know when you
get out of college or it's your first
adult relationships with people who
aren't your friends or aren't from
school or aren't your family is the
people you have at work and a we have a
whole generation of people that didn't
get to do that 100% I I actually full
honesty I don't think about that enough
I I can't imagine starting it into it
when I was 21 years old on Zoom yeah I
just never Mee another person right
never going out for drinks after work
and you're in a 500 foot apartment you
know in New York correct like so I I do
agree with this hybrid I mean full
remote I just can't I personally can't
wrap my head around yeah well I mean
I'll I'll talk to you on the other side
of the spectrum um I also think
that um when
people complain about the workforce and
we don't have enough Talent blah blah
blah I mean I'm an old lady now but I'm
a really smart old lady and I'm not done
and I think we miss we miss a lot of
wisdom out there because you know
inflexible we're inflexible about older
people right it's like they don't know
they don't know they don't know of
course they know I mean you know I've
been in Tech my whole life you think I
can't figure this stuff out so there's
like there's a calm and a wisdom that's
available to us too that's not just
fresh and young and new and it's that
combining those two things could be so
powerful once again it's not either or I
feel like this either or forcing is just
yeah and how we can learn from each
other yeah right I mean there's so
much I I mean I the reason I'm doing the
podcast with you is because I learn a
ton from talking to you because you're
in the real world now and I'm not in it
every day but I know what I've learned
and I know it's
possible Patty this was gold so
