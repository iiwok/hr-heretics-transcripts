did we get to where we're at now it's
 
did we get to where we're at now it's
very personal it's very high stakes it's
 
very personal it's very high stakes it's
very psychologist psychiatrist like how
 
very psychologist psychiatrist like how
do you know when that happens I think a
 
do you know when that happens I think a

and I think
where we go
 
where we go
bad or wrong is that you start off
 
bad or wrong is that you start off
thinking I can really help this person
 
thinking I can really help this person
and then you're just over your head over
 
and then you're just over your head over
your head especially timec consuming
 
your head especially timec consuming
very timec consuming yeah because that
 
very timec consuming yeah because that
