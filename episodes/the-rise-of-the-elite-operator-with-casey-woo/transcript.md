&gt;&gt; Hey everybody, welcome back to HR
 
&gt;&gt; Hey everybody, welcome back to HR
Heretics. Today we have Casey Woo
 
Heretics. Today we have Casey Woo
joining us. So Casey's been a longtime
 
joining us. So Casey's been a longtime
friend and he's one of the most
 
friend and he's one of the most
interesting people I've ever met and
 
interesting people I've ever met and
part of the reason why is his
 
part of the reason why is his
background. So Casey went from a public
 
background. So Casey went from a public
market investor to a fivetime exec at VC
 
market investor to a fivetime exec at VC
backed companies either as a CFO COO
 
backed companies either as a CFO COO
combo.
 
combo.
Then you started Operators Guild, which
 
Then you started Operators Guild, which
is the best community for CFO, COOs, and
 
is the best community for CFO, COOs, and
chief people officers. And then you
 
chief people officers. And then you
parlayed Operators Guild into a VC firm.
 
parlayed Operators Guild into a VC firm.
So Casey, we're stoked to have you on,
 
So Casey, we're stoked to have you on,
man.
 
man.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure
 
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure
to be here.
 
to be here.
&gt;&gt; I actually want to talk about We Work.
 
&gt;&gt; I actually want to talk about We Work.
And you worked at Weiwork during the
 
And you worked at Weiwork during the
heyday of crazy Weiwork. And I just want
 
heyday of crazy Weiwork. And I just want
to know what was it like working with
 
to know what was it like working with
Adam Newman.
 
Adam Newman.
&gt;&gt; So I think a little known random
 
&gt;&gt; So I think a little known random
statistic I'm going to create out of
 
statistic I'm going to create out of
thin air is nine out of 10 we workers
 
thin air is nine out of 10 we workers
would do it all over again.
 
would do it all over again.
To be clear, we work was not a fraud.
 
To be clear, we work was not a fraud.
Weiiwork was a mismanaged financial
 
Weiiwork was a mismanaged financial
thing with a great product. It lives
 
thing with a great product. It lives
today. It was one of the most special
 
today. It was one of the most special
moments of my what I call tours of duty.
 
moments of my what I call tours of duty.
As an operator, we work as a very rare
 
As an operator, we work as a very rare
situation where you got billions of
 
situation where you got billions of
dollars, literally, not figuratively, to
 
dollars, literally, not figuratively, to
build as fast as a human could build.
 
build as fast as a human could build.
When it comes to operating, one of the
 
When it comes to operating, one of the
biggest variables of sophistication or
 
biggest variables of sophistication or
skill level is rate of change and speed.
 
skill level is rate of change and speed.
We work as a different type of business
 
We work as a different type of business
building.
 
building.
Adam was the social
 
Adam was the social
energy.
 
energy.
He's probably one of the most magical
 
He's probably one of the most magical
storytellers I've ever met. I could
 
storytellers I've ever met. I could
listen to one thing, he can get on stage
 
listen to one thing, he can get on stage
and completely change my mind about the
 
and completely change my mind about the
thing I just saw.
 
thing I just saw.
You don't want to be on the other side
 
You don't want to be on the other side
of the fundraising table of that guy.
 
of the fundraising table of that guy.
&gt;&gt; What would you tell the audience, Casey?
 
&gt;&gt; What would you tell the audience, Casey?
the the two lessons you know that you do
 
the the two lessons you know that you do
it again that you learn to do and and
 
it again that you learn to do and and
then maybe a one that you wouldn't do
 
then maybe a one that you wouldn't do
again based on that course.
 
again based on that course.
&gt;&gt; Well, I think the lesson that is not
 
&gt;&gt; Well, I think the lesson that is not
secret is the laws of economics are like
 
secret is the laws of economics are like
physics.
 
physics.
While we were getting a lot of money at
 
While we were getting a lot of money at
big valuations, the laws of economics
 
big valuations, the laws of economics
pertain to every single business in the
 
pertain to every single business in the
world. There's no free valuation.
 
world. There's no free valuation.
The second is a general thing which is
 
The second is a general thing which is
I've seen companies when you go into
 
I've seen companies when you go into
hyperrowth where you have a lot of
 
hyperrowth where you have a lot of
resources
 
resources
the tendency is to not be as ruthlessly
 
the tendency is to not be as ruthlessly
prioritized.
 
prioritized.
It's basically restricted resources
 
It's basically restricted resources
forces innovation.
 
forces innovation.
&gt;&gt; Constraints breed innovation.
 
&gt;&gt; Constraints breed innovation.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the speed actually costs money.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the speed actually costs money.
going really fast. Actually, there's a
 
going really fast. Actually, there's a
uh break glass. So, they call it a
 
uh break glass. So, they call it a
growth tax.
 
growth tax.
So, if you want to go really fast, it
 
So, if you want to go really fast, it
could be I need more assistance and you
 
could be I need more assistance and you
need more sales people, I need because
 
need more sales people, I need because
you're just throwing bodies at it, so to
 
you're just throwing bodies at it, so to
speak. So, there is an interesting like
 
speak. So, there is an interesting like
equation where sometimes going faster
 
equation where sometimes going faster
costs more. It's a little bit
 
costs more. It's a little bit
counterintuitive. I think those are the
 
counterintuitive. I think those are the
lessons I've learned. There's more, but
 
lessons I've learned. There's more, but
that's I think the big ones. That
 
that's I think the big ones. That
actually brings me to my next question
 
actually brings me to my next question
which is around operators guild. So you
 
which is around operators guild. So you
have a community of you know 800 850
 
have a community of you know 800 850
elite operators. These are some of the
 
elite operators. These are some of the
best people in tech. What are they
 
best people in tech. What are they
saying about the current climate? Number
 
saying about the current climate? Number
one is we went through a very clear
 
one is we went through a very clear
phase
 
phase
of cutting back.
 
of cutting back.
So the mindset swings heavily as we've
 
So the mindset swings heavily as we've
seen in cycles from go go go I know that
 
seen in cycles from go go go I know that
at wei work to
 
at wei work to
less is more less is more do more with
 
less is more less is more do more with
less do more with less to the point
 
less do more with less to the point
where it's become ingrained now I think
 
where it's become ingrained now I think
it's extended to the point where it
 
it's extended to the point where it
becomes badge of honor becomes a thing
 
becomes badge of honor becomes a thing
becomes a mindset
 
becomes a mindset
a lot of founders etc operators
 
a lot of founders etc operators
realizing what they can do with less
 
realizing what they can do with less
kind of what I talked about in terms of
 
kind of what I talked about in terms of
when you get real bootstrap You'll be
 
when you get real bootstrap You'll be
surprised what you can do. Then the
 
surprised what you can do. Then the
other thing is AI.
 
other thing is AI.
AI also I think fuels the efficiency
 
AI also I think fuels the efficiency
mind,
 
mind,
right? It g it gives everyone this
 
right? It g it gives everyone this
mindset of how awesome would it be
 
mindset of how awesome would it be
to not hire ever and like triple
 
to not hire ever and like triple
productivity, right? Which is what the
 
productivity, right? Which is what the
promise of AI. The number one area I've
 
promise of AI. The number one area I've
seen is customer support.
 
seen is customer support.
&gt;&gt; Tell us what you're seeing. So there's a
 
&gt;&gt; Tell us what you're seeing. So there's a
company I will leave unnamed,
 
company I will leave unnamed,
but I think they had something like
 
but I think they had something like
 
Now they have 35. Wow.
 
Now they have 35. Wow.
And the 35 left are mostly all what I
 
And the 35 left are mostly all what I
call crossf functional operators.
 
call crossf functional operators.
They're not the more verticalized
 
They're not the more verticalized
specialists. And that's my belief
 
specialists. And that's my belief
is the next phase of operations is
 
is the next phase of operations is
highly skilled multidiscipline strategic
 
highly skilled multidiscipline strategic
takes in decisions from a lot of places
 
takes in decisions from a lot of places
makes a call translation sentient
 
makes a call translation sentient
and less so I have a skill set in
 
and less so I have a skill set in
call center management or sales or
 
call center management or sales or
and that's the first indicator of that
 
and that's the first indicator of that
who kept their jobs and who lost their
 
who kept their jobs and who lost their
jobs so to speak
 
and then the other side is so there's
 
and then the other side is so there's
people outside looking for job and then
 
people outside looking for job and then
there's people inside that have jobs
 
there's people inside that have jobs
working with AI, their challenge will be
 
working with AI, their challenge will be
the risks of AI.
 
the risks of AI.
So, everyone's under the gun to bring
 
So, everyone's under the gun to bring
some AI efficiency.
 
some AI efficiency.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; every board is expecting some initiative
 
&gt;&gt; every board is expecting some initiative
and so the talks are going to be
 
and so the talks are going to be
trade-offs. We are going to try this AI.
 
trade-offs. We are going to try this AI.
The risks are as follows. One company
 
The risks are as follows. One company
was in travel
 
was in travel
and AI started hallucinating
 
and AI started hallucinating
and spitting off travel that didn't
 
and spitting off travel that didn't
exist. Do you guys know how they solved
 
exist. Do you guys know how they solved
it? How the AI hallucinate? They got
 
it? How the AI hallucinate? They got
another AI to be its boss.
 
another AI to be its boss.
&gt;&gt; Oh, incredible.
 
&gt;&gt; Oh, incredible.
&gt;&gt; So, what happens is if both hallucinate,
 
&gt;&gt; So, what happens is if both hallucinate,
it's probably real or it's not. It's
 
it's probably real or it's not. It's
very unlikely they hallucinate
 
very unlikely they hallucinate
identically. So, we're as operators,
 
identically. So, we're as operators,
we're starting to become very
 
we're starting to become very
advanced or not advanced, we're evolving
 
advanced or not advanced, we're evolving
on the AI dynamics, but it's basically
 
on the AI dynamics, but it's basically
like um Iron Man.
 
like um Iron Man.
You're a human inside a machine. So,
 
You're a human inside a machine. So,
that's what I think it is. I don't think
 
that's what I think it is. I don't think
it's like we get replaced. I think we
 
it's like we get replaced. I think we
become we get Iron Man suits.
 
become we get Iron Man suits.

Do you think we're going too fast on the
 
Do you think we're going too fast on the
AI route? The companies you work with,
 
AI route? The companies you work with,
your community, I mean, are we kind of
 
your community, I mean, are we kind of
overdoing it on the pace here? The
 
overdoing it on the pace here? The
answer is yes. And the answer is it will
 
answer is yes. And the answer is it will
not stop.
 
not stop.
Someone taught me something really
 
Someone taught me something really
interesting. He's a technologist. He
 
interesting. He's a technologist. He
goes, "Mankind has a pattern. We
 
goes, "Mankind has a pattern. We
innovate on something that's very
 
innovate on something that's very
powerful and we unleash it into the
 
powerful and we unleash it into the
world.
 
world.
But many times we can't control it.
 
But many times we can't control it.
And there's massive good and massive
 
And there's massive good and massive
bad. Example, the car.
 
bad. Example, the car.
The combustion engine, massive good,
 
The combustion engine, massive good,
climate change problems. Once it's out,
 
climate change problems. Once it's out,
man runs with it. Good and bad. The cat
 
man runs with it. Good and bad. The cat
is out of the bag. Literally, man just
 
is out of the bag. Literally, man just
runs with it.
 
runs with it.
&gt;&gt; That is the exact same thing that's
 
&gt;&gt; That is the exact same thing that's
going to happen except on 10x greater
 
going to happen except on 10x greater
magnitude and speed.
 
magnitude and speed.
&gt;&gt; Casey, you have a take on the rise of
 
&gt;&gt; Casey, you have a take on the rise of
the operator. Can you explain to our
 
the operator. Can you explain to our
audience what that is?
 
audience what that is?
&gt;&gt; Yes. So I served some time in the
 
&gt;&gt; Yes. So I served some time in the
military. So you'll see some military
 
military. So you'll see some military
analogies. Then I became an economics
 
analogies. Then I became an economics
major at undergrad
 
major at undergrad
and was told there was two steps to
 
and was told there was two steps to
Nirvana. Step one is go to an island
 
Nirvana. Step one is go to an island
called Manhattan and get a banking job
 
called Manhattan and get a banking job
at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. And
 
at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. And
okay, so I went to Morgan Stanley. It
 
okay, so I went to Morgan Stanley. It
was amazing.
 
was amazing.
And the second and last step is get a
 
And the second and last step is get a
hedge fun or private equity job. Hold on
 
hedge fun or private equity job. Hold on
to it for 1015 years and retire. I
 
to it for 1015 years and retire. I
learned that I'm an operator. There is a
 
learned that I'm an operator. There is a
persona in the world that loves to
 
persona in the world that loves to
build.
 
build.
I was one of them. So what happened is I
 
I was one of them. So what happened is I
left, joined a 10person startup and
 
left, joined a 10person startup and
loved it so much in Silicon Alley
 
loved it so much in Silicon Alley
that I moved to Silicon Valley.
 
that I moved to Silicon Valley.
I was walked into a little company
 
I was walked into a little company
probably the most successful startup of
 
probably the most successful startup of
our generation of not second. There were
 
our generation of not second. There were
about 60 people at the time. Now they're
 
about 60 people at the time. Now they're
worth about 50 billion.
 
worth about 50 billion.
And they ask me two questions. They go,
 
And they ask me two questions. They go,
"Do you sell?"
 
"Do you sell?"
I go, "No." "Do you code?" "No." "Then
 
I go, "No." "Do you code?" "No." "Then
get out." I was like, "Um, but I do this
 
get out." I was like, "Um, but I do this
thing called finance and operations."
 
thing called finance and operations."
They go, "Oh, finance. Okay. Do you have
 
They go, "Oh, finance. Okay. Do you have
a CPA?"
 
a CPA?"
"Uh, no." Okay, then definitely get out
 
"Uh, no." Okay, then definitely get out
because everyone in the finance
 
because everyone in the finance
department is a CPA. He goes, you don't
 
department is a CPA. He goes, you don't
qualify for finance here. I was like, I
 
qualify for finance here. I was like, I
don't qualify for finance here. All I've
 
don't qualify for finance here. All I've
done for the last 10 years is a word
 
done for the last 10 years is a word
called finance. Finance in New York is
 
called finance. Finance in New York is
the Finance in Silicon Valley is
 
the Finance in Silicon Valley is
 That was 12 years ago.
 
 That was 12 years ago.
And I'm getting to the rise of the
 
And I'm getting to the rise of the
operator which is I am literally one of
 
operator which is I am literally one of
those stories except now I just found
 
those stories except now I just found
out that there's many of us.
 
out that there's many of us.
And so then nine people almost I think
 
And so then nine people almost I think
 
lunch meeting
 
lunch meeting
that I was invited to and I said, "Oh my
 
that I was invited to and I said, "Oh my
god, I feel you people. You I like
 
god, I feel you people. You I like
there's like finance ops." I said, 'Hey,
 
there's like finance ops." I said, 'Hey,
do you guys want to start a little mom
 
do you guys want to start a little mom
and dad's group for operators where we
 
and dad's group for operators where we
just help each other? I had five rules
 
just help each other? I had five rules
from the lessons I've learned elsewhere.
 
from the lessons I've learned elsewhere.
And that nine became almost 900 after 10
 
And that nine became almost 900 after 10
years. I think OG is one of the only
 
years. I think OG is one of the only
communities in the world that has ever
 
communities in the world that has ever
grown 100x organically.
 
grown 100x organically.
We don't have a single sales dollar
 
We don't have a single sales dollar
ever.
 
ever.
We have four title personas, director
 
We have four title personas, director
and above. Number one is finance. CFO
 
and above. Number one is finance. CFO
finance. Finance. Number two, COO ops.

Head of ops, customer ops, ops. Number
 
Head of ops, customer ops, ops. Number
three, special ops, rev ops, chief of
 
three, special ops, rev ops, chief of
staff, biz ops, strategy. Basically
 
staff, biz ops, strategy. Basically
almost no teams, internal ninjas or
 
almost no teams, internal ninjas or
consulting. And number four, heads of
 
consulting. And number four, heads of
business unit, general manager, early
 
business unit, general manager, early
CEO, founder. We also have 235 unique
 
CEO, founder. We also have 235 unique
titles
 
titles
across 800.
 
across 800.
Why in the world I want to ask you guys,
 
Why in the world I want to ask you guys,
it took me nine and a half years to get
 
it took me nine and a half years to get
this, so it's 20 seconds. Don't worry.
 
this, so it's 20 seconds. Don't worry.
Why would a chief of staff be with a
 
Why would a chief of staff be with a
founder,
 
founder,
be with a big-time CFO, the CEO, a head
 
be with a big-time CFO, the CEO, a head
of customer ops, a general manager, a
 
of customer ops, a general manager, a
strategist, and they keep choosing to
 
strategist, and they keep choosing to
renew in this group and not a chief of
 
renew in this group and not a chief of
staff group, a CFO group,
 
staff group, a CFO group,
a CEO group.
 
a CEO group.
I keep asking why, and then it hit me.
 
I keep asking why, and then it hit me.
The answer is we're business builders.
 
The answer is we're business builders.

What I've realized about OG is we are
 
What I've realized about OG is we are
special operations business building. It

That is a different business
 
That is a different business
than most, right? So the stakes and
 
than most, right? So the stakes and
everything are so different. That is the
 
everything are so different. That is the
rise
 
rise
of this elite operator class. You drop
 
of this elite operator class. You drop
us in, we can't help ourselves. We start
 
us in, we can't help ourselves. We start
to just blend into the whole thing and
 
to just blend into the whole thing and
just fix problems.
 
just fix problems.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Casey, you said you accidentally
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Casey, you said you accidentally
got a PhD in communities and loved the
 
got a PhD in communities and loved the
journey with Operator's Guild. What
 
journey with Operator's Guild. What
would you tell the audience about
 
would you tell the audience about
communities these days? cuz it's it has
 
communities these days? cuz it's it has
kind of blown up in a good way.
 
kind of blown up in a good way.
&gt;&gt; I think people may have forgotten that a
 
&gt;&gt; I think people may have forgotten that a
community
 
community
is based on relationships. Do not
 
is based on relationships. Do not
confuse friendships with memberships.
 
If you actually double click into
 
If you actually double click into
friendship and look into the equation,
 
friendship and look into the equation,
one of the biggest variables is called
 
one of the biggest variables is called
time. Best friends generally or
 
time. Best friends generally or
childhood best friends. You've gone
 
childhood best friends. You've gone
through everything together. They cannot
 
through everything together. They cannot
become a best friend generally unless
 
become a best friend generally unless
time has happened. People focus too much
 
time has happened. People focus too much
on the business of community and they
 
on the business of community and they
force friendships.
 
I think community is a compounding time
 
I think community is a compounding time
game. YPO,
 
game. YPO,
 
successful communities in the world
 
successful communities in the world
could not be done in four years. Um, and
 
could not be done in four years. Um, and
the other one's relevance. It sounds so
 
the other one's relevance. It sounds so
obvious. You need to be hyper relevant.
 
obvious. You need to be hyper relevant.
OG was accidentally hyper relevant
 
OG was accidentally hyper relevant
because there was no community for
 
because there was no community for
generalists. Zero. But the answer is we
 
generalists. Zero. But the answer is we
exist. We are actually a community that
 
exist. We are actually a community that
we didn't know. So if you're going to
 
we didn't know. So if you're going to
create a community, it better be very
 
create a community, it better be very
hyper
 
hyper
relevant and understandable and it has a
 
relevant and understandable and it has a
hardship element. I think don't get me
 
hardship element. I think don't get me
wrong, not everything has to be
 
wrong, not everything has to be
hardship, but let me tell you, building
 
hardship, but let me tell you, building
companies at our scale and getting
 
companies at our scale and getting
tossed out every 18 months is a very
 
tossed out every 18 months is a very
special hardship that we only
 
special hardship that we only
understand. Bingo. Casey, do you ever
 
understand. Bingo. Casey, do you ever
miss operating? What's my one of my last
 
miss operating? What's my one of my last
questions for you?
 
questions for you?
&gt;&gt; I haven't had a chance to miss it

them. It's just problem solving.
 
them. It's just problem solving.
But I will say for operators, I do think
 
But I will say for operators, I do think
there's a world where we move to
 
there's a world where we move to
founding. Like I think founding a
 
founding. Like I think founding a
business it is the ultimate autonomy
 
business it is the ultimate autonomy
building highstakes adrenaline rush and
 
building highstakes adrenaline rush and
it's your baby.
 
it's your baby.
So I think all operators after a while
 
So I think all operators after a while
when they go to am I going to be a
 
when they go to am I going to be a
seventime CFO a 19 time COO
 
seventime CFO a 19 time COO

&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I think the difference and this is part
 
&gt;&gt; I think the difference and this is part
of the air quote book is I want to tell
 
of the air quote book is I want to tell
all my operator friends, all my
 
all my operator friends, all my
generalist buddies out there
 
generalist buddies out there
to have confidence. It's scary. Leaving
 
to have confidence. It's scary. Leaving
the home of a big company or corporation
 
the home of a big company or corporation
and just doing your own thing is scary.
 
and just doing your own thing is scary.
But what you need to remember is what
 
But what you need to remember is what
we've been trained at whether we like it

or not is business building.
 
or not is business building.
Like we are some of the best at it with

There's nothing stopping you from doing
 
There's nothing stopping you from doing

whatever title you were called.
So to everyone listening out there, open
 
So to everyone listening out there, open
up the horizon
 
up the horizon
because I think there's one difference
 
because I think there's one difference
between like classic founders and us. We
 
between like classic founders and us. We
there's a little bit of ego. I'm going
 
there's a little bit of ego. I'm going
to say it. There's a little bit of conf
 
to say it. There's a little bit of conf
there's a little bit of visionary that
 
there's a little bit of visionary that
you kind of need to just do it. It's a
 
you kind of need to just do it. It's a
really hard thing. And I think a lot of
 
really hard thing. And I think a lot of
operators are a little too
 
operators are a little too
self-regulated.
 
self-regulated.
They're too analytical and like I don't
 
They're too analytical and like I don't
know and they're like doing the
 
know and they're like doing the
trade-offs because that's what we're
 
trade-offs because that's what we're
good at. We we do we analyze it stops us
 
good at. We we do we analyze it stops us
&gt;&gt; and there's a lot to lose though.
 
&gt;&gt; and there's a lot to lose though.
There's a lot there's a lot to lose.
 
There's a lot there's a lot to lose.
Like there tech salaries are very real.
 
Like there tech salaries are very real.
&gt;&gt; There's a lot%.
 
&gt;&gt; There's a lot%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so we are a little too calculated
 
&gt;&gt; And so we are a little too calculated
and so we sometimes need a little push
 
and so we sometimes need a little push
on the other side
 
on the other side
which is that variable called what am I
 
which is that variable called what am I
giving you know what am I gaining to
 
giving you know what am I gaining to
give up. It could be gaining huge
 
give up. It could be gaining huge
things, but you have to have a little
 
things, but you have to have a little
confidence of like I can build and
 
confidence of like I can build and
figure it out and I got some chops to do
 
figure it out and I got some chops to do
it and if I don't know, I know who to
 
it and if I don't know, I know who to
hire. That's the other power of an
 
hire. That's the other power of an
operator. We find the right teams and
 
operator. We find the right teams and
that becomes invincible. If you think
 
that becomes invincible. If you think
about it,
 
about it,
&gt;&gt; if you can build any team,
 
&gt;&gt; if you can build any team,
&gt;&gt; you can solve anything. You look at
 
&gt;&gt; you can solve anything. You look at
Elon, build a freaking space company for
 
Elon, build a freaking space company for
God's sakes, you know, that's and then a
 
God's sakes, you know, that's and then a
car company. he knows how to assemble
 
car company. he knows how to assemble
the teams or get the so and he's like an
 
the teams or get the so and he's like an
ultimate business builder, right? So,
 
ultimate business builder, right? So,
yeah, I I I think that's my biggest
 
yeah, I I I think that's my biggest
message to everyone is I haven't left
 
message to everyone is I haven't left
operating, but there is the whole like
 
operating, but there is the whole like
hang your own shingle or do something a
 
hang your own shingle or do something a
little more oh my gosh, it's all me. Uh,
