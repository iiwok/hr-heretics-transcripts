all right everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we have Heather do on the
show Heather you are currently at signal
fire as the head of talent previously
you were the VP of people at web flow
you've been at a number of places in
your career where I actually want to
start is you were at hired reporting up
to somebody who we might know who is
Kelly on our show and you were
mentioning some pretty brutal management
tactics and abusive practices that I
would like you to alert our audience
about I I was not I was not prepared for
this fun fact I did not report up to
Kelly I was not so lucky that's right
and so as much as I wish I could tell
you Tales of her management style I only
got to experience her as our wonderful
head of people so you know what Heather
I I remember we interviewed Heather and
we were chatting before and I was so
excited to join HED and I was like this
woman's a badass like she was running
the the the talent function and whatnot
and it was crazy in there remember how
we were growing and all and she's like I
I want to be an L &amp;d I want to come over
I'm like I would love you I don't even
know what I'm doing half the day I can't
do L&amp;D right now but since then I just
said before we started Nolan she's
crushing and amazing career and amazing
leader in person so yeah so bummer that
didn't fit my narrative clearly it was a
total lie because the org chart didn't
happen once once in a while okay so so I
want to talk about signal Fire's state
of the talent report state of talent
report can you tell us what that is and
what you guys found in that report yeah
so maybe a little bit about signal fire
to help you kind of contextualize this
is that we're a venture capital firm but
we're built like a technology company to
serve the needs of Founders and one of
the unique things that we do is we have
this value ad called Beacon which is an
AI Talent engine essentially tracks 80
million companies 600 million people and
so we use that to actually inform our
investments to help our companies and
our portfolio find you know companies uh
for customers as well as um talent but
you can also use that data to understand
the market in a really Global Way which
is very fascinating to me personally and
so I set out with our head of research
to kind of answer the questions that we
know these things are sort of stewing
around the world but we don't always
have the data behind them to confirm our
suspicions and so everyone's talking
about AI everyone's talking about people
leaving you know San Francisco or going
to certain places or going remote like
we wanted to actually test these numbers
behind the scenes I asked 35 different
data questions to our head of research
can you help me figure out if any of
these things are actually happening and
the most three interesting themes that
came through were around the GE movement
piece actually really interesting Is the
Gen Z versus Gen X workplace Trends and
then of course Ai and what's really
happening under the surface with who's
actually getting hired every job
description says we need a PhD in
computer science for some ml role but
that's not who's actually getting hired
and so really fascinating kind of like
pull back the curtain on some of the
things that we might suspect okay so
let's go in order so talk to us about
goo and specifically what you guys found
yeah so it's complicated because there's
a percent of growth versus a raw growth
so in terms of raw growth basically the
most common move you would see is
someone leaving San Francisco or leaving
Seattle in the last four years like
pandemic wide um and moving to New York
City that is like the raw growth number
one thing that's happening that said
it's a little misleading because it
doesn't mean that like New York took
over as the tech hub San Francisco by
far away still has the biggest
concentration of tech Talent we're just
seeing a lot of shift in that direction
and then the other thing that was really
interesting to me was Texas so I know
Austin to be like a tech Hub but what I
didn't realize that five percentage of
growth over the course of its own
population before the pandemic to now it
grew more than any other um kind of tech
Hub or any other City really in the
country and Dallas which I never think
about as a tech Hub came in number three
and so when you think about sort of like
this idea of where you hire where you
launch a company today and the idea of
remote work and where you might be able
to hire from to know that these other
places are really forming with a great
concentration of top talent was super
fascinating and I know we're all in
different locations I've anecdotally
noticed that New York has it feels like
many of my friends have moved there it
feels like the younger generation is
picking New York instead of San
Francisco um and everybody in New York
it feels like is actually working in
person versus working hybrid or remote
yeah yeah I agree it's it's interesting
there are new grads that we've invested
in who are moving from like Michigan or
other kind of University centers and
they're choosing New York as the place
to launch their company and I think a
lot of it is like this feeling of the
energy is what a lot of people describe
like this notion of it's back like New
York kind of hit hardest of the pandemic
earlier than everyone El recovered
faster than everyone else everything
just moves faster there so when you're
really thinking about like hustle and
bustle and trying to create a company a
lot of Founders are choosing to found
their companies there and then Talent is
going there because it just seems fun as
in an energy goes and they still don't
take a huge risk it's not like they're
leaping to someplace that's not a known
entity for great job market as well I
feel like anecdotally I feel like I just
have more chats with people in New York
now right like just just doing this for
a period of of years and I'm like oh
where are you been New York New York
it's happening more than than I feel
like it has in the past I have a
question what about like any cities
hether that are retracting anything in
the data year seen around surprises
around cities that have less Talent than
before anything like that Phoenix was
the only one that saw a loss which I
thought was really interesting because I
used to think of Phoenix as like the
sales Hub like where you would go put a
sales team and yeah and I think Utah is
actually gaining it's not in our top 10
but when I think about now when people
are talking about where to put people
know I'm curious ious because you've got
Roots there I hear that there's now more
than one Tech Hub and people are also
thinking about wanting people to be in
the same office as the rest of the team
because there's that return to office
movement it's also affecting sales so I
think there could be a piece of that too
but that's just my speculation on the
side the data just showed six% losses
essentially in Phoenix and then in
Seattle was really interesting because
there was Flatline growth 6% growth but
pretty flat for big Tech which is like
Boeing Amazon a lot of big tech
companies are there but there was huge
growth in Seattle it was the number two
by percentage for startup so I think
they are leaving one job and entering
another all of our data was tracking
startup talent for the most part and so
when you think about that it's not
necessarily that the the the city size
itself is growing but it's where Tech is
merging forward and especially in this
world of return to office that sort of
what you want to think about is like
where can you actually hire the best
talent where are they concentrated today
yep I can tell you that Utah's
absolutely growing unfortunately for me
we moved in 2018 but it is a huge hub
for sales Talent because of actually the
Mormon religion interestingly enough
part of the reason why is because when
they go on their their missions they
have to like most of them are going to a
brand new country learning a brand new
language and they're going door Todo
selling the most difficult thing in the
world which is religion I also have data
on Arizona I went to Gilbert High School
and my joke on that is those of us who
grew up there spent our entire lives
trying to leave and now on Instagram
everyone's like oh Scottdale it's great
and we are now officially in the season
in which my Instagram for my friends in
Arizona I don't see anything from them
and so I think part of the reason you're
seeing people leaving Arizona is it
turns out it's insanely hot from call it
April through October but Instagram
doesn't really do a good job of showing
the downside of the tradeoff of location
I saw a video where someone was frying
an egg on the floor in Arizona so I am
very aware of the Heat and I would like
never go I mean it sounds like lovely to
have Spa life and live in Scottsdale
with the shopping center and just retire
there but then I think about the Heat
and I don't want those electricity bills
for the air conditioning yeah so talk to
us about the the Gen Z findings that you
also had yeah so these to me are the
most fascinating and it was interesting
when we did this report the media really
picked up and honed in on the location
movement but to me the Gen Z piece is
massive because we're still learning gen
Z is just four years out maybe five
years out at most right now of college
but if you look at the first four years
of a Gen X grad you know back then for
the first four years of a gen zrad today
the average gen xrad 20 to 30 years ago
was seeing about 1.1 jobs in their first
four years out of school meaning they
took a job and they pretty much stayed
there that is doubled for Gen Z so now
gen Z is on average 2.2 in their first
four years and so they're just changing
jobs at a much more rapid Pace Gen Y
which you know Millennial known as which
I'm a part of is right in the middle
like 1.8 and if you think about it it's
just trending in this direction of like
lack of maybe tenure and staying and
kind that being an important thing but
with genx say like oh they they have you
know no recessionary environment no like
bad economy with the pandemic any of
those pieces but geny did right so it's
just really fascinating to see I stayed
for almost five years yeah my first I
think I'm X right is that right I left
in six months I've strangely held every
job I've ever had for between two to
three years I'm about to hit three years
at signal fire I'm going to break a
record for myself I'm very excited but
like it's that chronic kind of movement
and I don't know what you all think
because we don't we know the movement
itself but we don't know the intent
behind the movement so I've been asking
co-workers who are or jenzi anecdotally
what do you think this is and I don't
know for sure but I don't think they see
the workplace as loyal to them the way I
think a lot of us like aligned our
identities around a workplace like you
ask me like about myself I'm going to
tell you what I do and where I work in
like the first 10 seconds they don't
feel the same way for the most part and
so jobs are more transient but that's
the anecdotal what I'm saying I'm
curious what you all are seeing from
that that population
yeah I agree I mean I I think the the
Loyalty factor is much different and
because of that they'll jump right they
got a raise here or raise there and
they'll they'll jump very quickly and I
think maybe also the macro like some
folks have lost their jobs or are afraid
of that and and so there's there's that
element too which I think is a bit
different than at least what I
experience yeah my take is my take is is
there's not many companies actually
investing in New grads so it's one thing
to hire a new grad it's another thing to
invest in them and to help them grow one
of the reasons I I left I had I had a
great job but my boss moved over to
Google at the time and so I followed him
to Google and at Google it was just like
there's a bunch of people my age in my
role all getting like this immersive
training and it it felt a little bit
like an extension of college for me and
I felt like you know I I obviously
wanted to make more money and all of
those sorts of things but I felt like
they were they were doing their part to
help me grow and I feel like today
there's this like great we hired you now
like go solve business problems and the
entirely like skip step of I college
didn't teach me like I I didn't
know I didn't learn anything about how
to be a business person in college I
learned that working and we're skipping
over that step for these people and I
feel like that's part of the reason
I couldn't agree with that more I don't
know if you you probably haven't read my
dissertation but it was all focused on
the impacts of college on people's
careers and I focused on women because
women are less likely to negotiate all
these pieces and I wanted to know how
much does college actually serve as a
great equalizer and the answer is not at
all all of the most impactful things
from college are actually like
internships Student Activities the
things outside of the curriculum itself
and so when you think about this genen Z
population they went to college during a
Pand pmic like if they graduated in 2019
that's the earliest group but the large
share the past share is going to have
gone through high school college and the
workforce in this post-pandemic world
that's like figuring itself out that's a
really hard place to kind of miss out on
maybe some of those kind of immersive
social activities that can prepare you
for the true hardships of a workplace
especially in a return to office
environment so it's going to be slower
on the uptake for a allot of these
things they're probably going to require
a lot more structure and support and
investment and I don't hear about like
the rotational programs as much as I
used do any more those Investments where
you could kind of try out different
things like I think there's a little bit
more like what can we get for the money
at least not in service but but in
bigger you know tech companies like
shareholder value is important and
companies aren't doing as well they've
got to figure out where they can like be
efficient as the code word and a lot of
times that means not investing in more
Junior Talent what do you think about
like back to your dissertation Heather
and where that's going like I'm hearing
more and more College might not matter
why should I attend to the point of it's
not helping preparing let's just skip it
and work and I've known some people that
have done that very successful do you
think there's any legs to that or you
know where that might go in the future
yeah I mean it's so interesting you see
so many Founders who are 18 years old
right now granted there are more
Founders who are older we found that in
our report as well than there had been
historically but there's a lot of kind
of people skipping out on College to
found companies or to just join
companies and so I think again the jury
is still out this this generation's
still very new but when you think about
attending a four-year University and
paying that tuition to attend classes
online and maybe miss out on a lot of
the experiential piece I don't know that
the ROI is totally there I don't know
what I would do I think I probably go to
college because that's just the have
three degrees like that's just the kind
of person I am you love learning I love
learning I'm a student and I think I
love achieving but I I don't see a value
prop in going to University that I once
saw and I think that goes into the other
piece of the report that was really
notable is this notion of you see on job
description so often must have a
bachelor's degree in XY or Z or
equivalent and uh there's a lot of
requirements for people to have this
college education that feels like a
necessary almost evil that you have to
pay for in order to get access to a
certain kind of job or a certain
category of job and that to me is just
really an outdated mindset especially
given what we know about how effective a
college curriculum can be and the irony
in all of this is my master's degree is
in higher education like literally the
focus the study of universities and most
everything that we studied was about
like access and Equity issues the
inefficiencies of University and
bureaucracy and all these things that
happen and so as much as I am a product
of that kind of a background I'm
probably like one of the biggest

little less human yet delighting a

from HR Heretics
 
say I mean job description requirements
aren't even real like they're they're
really not even real and there's
actually there's data on this to where
men are more likely to apply to a job in
which they don't have all of the
requirements where women feel like they
have to check every box I just think
requirements and J I don't even know why
they're in there like I I truly don't
understand that anymore at CA Henry
hated this and his take was like we're
just solving problems like let's like
get rid of job descriptions let's do
problem descriptions we don't need
requirements let's just talk about the
problems that they're going to solve and
then put that out into the world and
like have people explain to us why they
are most equipped to solve these
problems I honestly think job
descriptions is one of those things we
just keep doing it the way that we've
always done it because nobody's creative
enough or nobody's even thinking about
trying to do something new here yeah I'm
so curious how you would solve it
actually I don't think you need
requirements at all I I just I don't you
know because here what is it what do
requirements help you with they help you
with
filtering and if we're being really
honest you know I think there's this
there's this misnomer that AI is taking
over at the front end of the applicant
tracking system I haven't seen it like I
haven't seen you know God's AI that
comes in and says like this is the
resume that the recruiting team should
talk to maybe it exists like please send
me yourself I would love to look at it I
haven't seen it yet and and it's
definitely not widely deployed even if
it exists looked at a job description in
a while I'll be honest I haven't but I
think that a lot of most of them do not
have that required
experience phrase anymore if anything
they've moved it to nice to have or oh
it's in there it's it's defin it's
definitely there's like a there's like a
requirement section and often Heather's
right often times they're including
something around like a higher educ
education degree It's usually the first
line which is the strangest one so weird
Bachelors what happens I mean we've all
been in ahead of talent seat right and I
think what happens is company goes okay
we need to hire a this like a software
engineer or a marketing manager or
whatever it is okay tell us about the
profile and a recruiter is going through
the motions of saying okay let's
understand and they start from the
beginning which is they should have come
from this kind of background and then
they start to use kind of proxies and
college degree is one of those proxies
I think it's silly because quite frankly
I was a creative writing major I don't
know that has anything to do with what I
do I mean I do technically post a lot on
LinkedIn so maybe there's that but I I
did poetry ta this is not relevant but
what is very relevant is the work that I
did working with Kelly at hire that was
like the best training ground I actually
had for my BC job because it was looking
at talent in this other model like
turning it on its head and I think a lot
of times like there's this idea of you
want somebody who's seen the movie
before so that they can come in and do
the job really effectively because
they've learned from the mistakes and
errors so I'm not saying throw out all
the requirements um because otherwise
you'd have 10,000 people who are really
excited about the idea of the job you
have that have no relevant contributions
to make or they're going to be making
mistakes doing it for the first time
versus somebody who could be very
knowledgeable the other piece I want to
just quickly hit on that you mentioned
which I find also hilarious is this oh I
want somebody who's seen the movie
before and I think there's this company
perspective that like oh yeah like Nolan
LED Talent at door Dash and so like he
should come lead Talent here and like
why would that be interesting to me like
why why would I want to go do the exact
same thing versus like taking on new
responsibilities so I can learn and grow
and I think that I I have a take that
you know you need to be like giving
people as they ascend in their career
more scope more responsibility because
otherwise they're going to stagnate and
they're going to leave and the person
who wants to run the exact same Playbook
I would I my bias is is probably not
going to come in with like the most
novel ideas to solve your problems so
what about someone like me all right CPO
for 14 years are you saying that I
haven't I haven't come in with novel
ideas for 14 what what are you doing
right now well I mean that's 14 years
later but you said the next job you said
one right after and so I've done it
maybe four five six times and maybe you
took on maybe there's like an extension
of like some function that I didn't you
know maybe you didn't have HR maybe you
didn't have recruit maybe there's like a
new thing that you get to take on I yeah
fair enough I do think that you know
difference in environment difference in
growth stage difference in product or go
to market that those are differences
fair enough and the last thing I'll say
the education thing I think is going to
be like that's going to be very
interesting to watch because I think we
are early on and people kind of like
sideways looking at this these degrees
Heather and Nolan and the irony is it's
still in these job
descriptions bachelor's degree required
in a system that we just basically
on early on and said that a lot of
people aren't need so they're not
reconciling in my opinion anymore and
it's going to be interesting to we're in
transition and I actually think the
transition is going to be pretty ugly
for this this current generation that is
in school and like these kids that are
in high school that are about to go to
college because college has never been
more expensive and has never delivered
less value and so you're going to have
these people who finish who are like hey
I did the things you told me to do
where's my job and the you know the
business world's going to be like we
don't give a about that as you can
hear in this podcast I do think that
this the people in college today if
they're sophomores now are going to
graduate in a healthier uh economy for
the jobs market and they might just get
lucky but yes no I don't think it's
because of college I think that's like a
conflating it's like an error jobs are
always miscalibrated in the beginning
you make this job description you say
this is what you're going after and then
Midway through you realize no candidates
passing xphase of our interview process
we probably have to go back to the
drawing board and figure out what we
really need and then it's something else
entirely um and so I mean all of these
pieces are just maybe new ways of
looking at a a resume and trying to pull
out the value of that person that they
could bring to your company and then
just one more thing because I'm I'm on a
rant uh which is that noan I disagree
with you about the doing the same job
twice I'm with Kelly on this one what I
think is that you do a job once and
you're learning how to do it on the job
in real time and every day is the
biggest day of your life you're going to
make errors if you're taking big risks
but imagine if you could take what you
learn from that job do it again in a
similar environment and do it better
gives you a lot more space and time and
mental bandwidth to add on new things
try new experiments like you get
incrementally better each time and
similar yeah no companies are exactly
the same point in time of growth stage
business model whatever else you're
always going to be hiring for different
kinds of things and so they do get
interest
I think why I switched to VC though is
because I completely burned out on that
model of doing it a little better each
time it was like frying my brain every
single day trying to to react to
pandemic mixed with HR leader you know
return to office mixed with HR leader
whatever else there's always a new
flavor being added and the job scope
itself of a chro is evolving so
essentially you have no scope over roll
There's No Boundaries yeah on the CPO
job expanding thing so I I just saw this
the other day on LinkedIn and I feel
like I can't tell what HR leaders want
in one hand they want like like what you
just said which is like oh my God we're
doing so much and then on the other hand
they're like I want to seat at the
table and for me it's like hold on we're
giving you more responsibility like
we're asking you to step up I don't feel
like we ever have this conversation
about CFOs and I feel like CFOs actually
do the most in the company and get the
least credit and they're always the bad
person because they hold the pur strings
and I just feel like there's this like a
little bit of whininess around like oh
my God my job's expanding so please
please disagree with me on this but like
I don't I don't understand why there's
so much of that in today's world you
know what I think I you know and I'll
just be very honest I think that it's
different in my opinion Nolan because
because not everyone thinks they can do
the CFO job not everyone has an opinion
on how things should be with with our
stuff everyone has an opinion everyone
knows how to do it everyone has a strong
point of view on fill-in the blank
RTO the it's it's a very difficult thing
to navigate when you feel like Stretch
Armstrong and you're pulled in eight
different directions and getting to
throwing at you and you know and then
and then everyone's screaming and
disagreeing they look at you what's the
answer that that is very I don't think
CFOs experience that on literally a
daily basis not one thing like 12 things
yeah Bill Billy the the VP evge has like
you know is is showing up to every exec
meeting criticizing you because he's got
better ideas on how to run the the
people and culture strategy I've been a
people manager so I know how you should
run the systems around people management
that's I also think like CFO job is very
hard and I think the both the CFO and
CHR are very important roles to be at
the table because they're horizontal
right there's verticals and you can own
a certain part of the business but these
two have to think at the company level
at all times like a lot of times you
can't think about what's right for your
function or your team you to think about
what's right for the whole business
whereas you see a little bit of the
healthy push and pull between a sales
and a marketing team I think the
difference with the finance role and the
HR role is the amount of stuff that's
confidential under the iceberg where no
news is kind of good news and ultimately
what I'll say is I'll never have known
how much Kelly actually had to navigate
as a people leader at hired as a part of
this Talent team because so much of it's
G like I don't know if there were
investigations I don't know what else is
taking up her time there's a lot of
really discretion oriented cases where
you can't talk and so you're constantly
walking on eggshells trying to be like
an actual contributor to the business
strategy and think about how can people
and business come together and be those
side-by-side Partners while also
maintaining the level of dignity and
discretion for the humans involved
underneath the pieces that you know that
are also happening and Dynamics at play
it is a tight RT walk versus CFO super
hard job no doubt especially in this
world of strategic finance and having to
figure out burn multiples and all these
things but the data is not quite so
confidential it's not people at stake
it's not dignity at stake so ultimately
certainly all these jobs are hard I
don't envy anybody but there's a Nuance
to a people leader and the information
that you have to hold at one time and be
so stealth and thought ful and how you
speak that no one else really has to do
except for maybe the CEO or their Chief
of Staff yeah you do have to wear a lot
of hats that's a really good point
Heather and the last thing I'll say on
this is again to your point Heather all
these roles are are very hard I do think
the cheap people offers to role the
boundaries are a little bit more fuzzy
like the role is a little bit more
ambiguous in terms of what it could and
could not do and so it can be harder for
those people to kind of say oh there
there's a there's a line here
than it is for maybe a CFO or a cro or
something like that and what like what
is the definition of success it's it's
humans it's messy it's it's not but I
think it's I think it's the the
definition of success is actually by
like by CEO they have different
definitions that's that's I think the
hardest aspect of the job is that
depending on which CEO you work with
they have like different things that
they care about and you know those
things may match up with your with where
your strengths are where like the
company currently is or like you know
somewhere that is aspirational that the
company's never going to get to but the
the word I would use is subjectivity
there's a lot of subjectivity all around
the best thing you can do is try to take
as much out of that truth and get clear
on it before you start which we've
talked about okay shifting gears Heather
you have a take on companies being
remote ready can you explain what what
does that mean and why do you feel like
companies need to be remote ready it's a
great question so well first of all if
you look at my background I've worked
remote since 2018 so I know what it's
like being in an office prior and the
benefits and challenges of that and and
then I know what it's like working from
home one or two days we kind of being
hybrid and that's how I kind of realized
remote work was for me and then I
actually moved remote fully to Portland
Oregon you know and have been remote
working for San Francisco headquartered
companies ever since but I think what
I've realized is that as a company on
the organization side the hardest thing
you can do is build a hybrid
organization it is so much more
challenging for the company maybe it's
great for the worker I'm sure it is and
for many people they prefer it um but
you have to build for two distinctive
experiences both in an office experience
and a remote experience and you have to
build for the two of them to converse
with each other because most companies
don't have it where everybody just works
from home on Fridays it's different days
of the week people are coming in and
coming out so every meeting is managing
these robust Dynamics and so I think
when companies all were forced into
going remote I was already working for
remote Force company webflow and we had
been operating with 20% of the company
in office in San Francisco and 80% was
remote around the world this is how we
operated from day one so when the
pandemic clicked off we said okay we're
just GNA flip the other 20% to go remote
two right and it's easy because we've
operated this way from the beginning and
I remember Jack Alman called me and was
like we need to do a webinar for our
customers about how they can navigate
this transition to remote work and can
you come help us and do a tableside chat
with me I said sure So we do this chat
and I'm giving all this advice about how
to do remote work and whatever else
completely ignoring the nature of what
we were about to experience in terms of
mental health physical health all the
pieces of a pandemic that kind of threw
a wrench in every best laid plan about
how to remote work right and everybody
was in such survival mode that I think
what ended up happening is nobody really
got a chance to try out the best
practices of remote work they were just
trying to keep the lights on and
navigate these unsteady Waters I will
say at webflow it was not hard running a
remote first team in 2019 it was very
very hard in 2020 and so I can of
disaggregate those two pieces and so
obviously now we're in this place where
most companies are saying let's just
compromise on hybrid because employees
like it even though I really truly
believe it's the worst of both worlds on
the company's organizing side but this
is happening now partly because it's a
really good hiring environment if you're
hiring as a company very few companies
are hiring extensively and so there's a
large pool of talent that's ready and
waiting to join these companies and it's
willing to work in an office it's
willing to do hybri and is locally there
I'm looking forward to 5 years from now
where
essentially the tables are going to turn
back to how it felt maybe in 2021 when
there was a great resignation and people
are looking for new jobs and whatever
else and it's hard to get Talent if you
think about the movement of how AI is
growing and you think about the the
macroeconomy we're poised to have a
cyclical change in five years and be
back to a place where candidates have
the power across the board and when that
happens now companies are going to be
going shoot I want to hire these people
but that person's in New York everyone
moved to New York what do I de with over
there and whatever else and so you have
a choice to either open more offices
which is really expensive and still
operate basically remote because people
are talking across country to each other
or you can be a little more flexible on
how you hire and hire people remote and
distributed and I do think it will come
back around again this is my personal
take it's going to take some time but
it's going to work its way back up and
ultimately whether you think you're just
going to stay hybrid forever or you
think you might want to have the
flexibility to expand your talent pool
in 5 years when your business needs
Express that it's going to be a lot
harder to suddenly get good at remote
work to attract and retain these people
you have to start now and you can start
now even if you've returned to office
because even if people are working from
home one day a week or when they're sick
or something else they're still having
that experience so just setting yourself
up for it today is like huge for
tomorrow hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a award from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join forward-thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and

peel Kelly what do you think no I I
listen I I think that the toothpaste is
out of the tube a lot on a lot of this
flexibility the pandemic you know people
were doing it before obviously but the
pandemic gave a lot more people a lot
more license like all at once to move
abroad to do this to travel I mean I I
plan on doing it at some point right
Airbnb here then go here I mean I think
that that toothpaste is out of the tube
I think that that there is now a new
expectation around
flexibility and I think that companies
are going to have to work with that and
I don't know about you both but e even
the past you know few years I've heard
or have seen CEOs that have been very
rigid no we're hiring hubs we're doing
that and then they realize oh but
there's like a gang Buster talent in
Georgia and I'm gonna make an
exception and everyone's watching that
and then the policy goes like so I just
think it's a little naive to think that
um you know great great talent to your
point at some point will have the power
and the Choice good ones do now and I
think flexibility is is is something
that's going to be table Stakes yeah I I
think it's so I'm not as bullish on you
five years from now and and the reason
why is because I just I do think AI is
going
to cost us jobs I don't think it's going
to add jobs and I I know that that's a
contrarian take to what all the smart
VCS are saying so we'll see what happens
but one of the things that Kelly you
just said which I totally agree with is
that somebody like you is always going
to have opportunities agnostic of your
location but you have somebody that has
a ton of agency because you have built
up a ton of skill that any business
would want and this is the bifurcation
that I don't think we're talking a whole
lot about is there is a very small
subset of talent that has gained
incredible expertise that any business
is like I will make that exception for
that person and then there's like every
everybody else and I worry about like
this this everyone else thing given the
expectations that they think that
they're like in that really small sliver
of talent and they're not and those
companies are just going to be like I
can find you close to where my office is
because you're either going to move or
I'm GNA find somebody here that's
actually going to come do this that's
what I think is more going to happen in
the next five years I think there will
absolutely be exceptions I think you
know the other thing is is like we're
being disingenuous when we look at at
today and we say oh this company is in
office or this company is remote or this
company is hybrid if you are successful
literally every single company has some
either remote version or hybrid version
because you just keep scaling you keep
adding people Facebook isn't only in
Meno Park Google's not only in Mountain
View like and they have in-person
requirements but they they're so
successful that they have many offices
so I think it's a lot more Nuance but I
do think there is this agency piece that
a lot of candidates believe that they
have because in the pandemic they were
allowed to do it that is now being
ripped away from them and we haven't
fully realized that I think I think it's
a good point which you know entitlement
is a word that went into my head as you
were describing that like and I think
it's it's it's I I like to think about
how these words are going to be used
like in five years I hope to God we're
not saying hybrid remote and office like
you know what I mean like one day
everyone's going to be all those all
those things it's just going to be how
it is and so I just hope we stop saying
that one day because everyone's all
those damn things and and I think it
will be more nuanced Nolan like it'll
depend on the P some blend of the person
the level the function and the job um
versus what everyone's trying to do now
right Heather is like pick a lane who
are you you're we're one of these things
and and I just got hot on our segment
that layered today it's it's usually
never just one thing I think where
people get it wrong is the focus is on
the where we work when in reality it's
like the how we work love that and
ultimately when I say remote ready it's
less about whether people are remote
working or not it's the Readiness to
have a Workforce that is decentralized
because that has already been the
reality like you say like a Facebook or
go for a long time you might have a team
that's in APAC while you're in AIA and
you're still conversing you know in real
time on these calls even if you're but
required to be in the office which is
the interesting part and so it's similar
to the job description like we have
these rules of the road that we've
pushed for so long and if you really
step back like some of them don't make a
ton of sense but people like structure
and order so it's like an evolution over
time for Readiness to step away from the
labels and move into the capabilities y
so Heather you at signal fire see a lot
of early stage companies talk to us
about some of the common patterns that
you see as it relates to mistakes yeah
so I to give you some context I work
with companies that are two people in an
idea literally pre product all the way
through to my focus caps out around like
 
teammates who take the the lead from
there and so you see these growth
patterns happen and I would say the bulk
of who I work with are the seed
companies that's my focus and my passion
because it's so fun when there's nothing
there and you get to create from
Greenfield in in concert and so these
people don't have heads of people or
Talent again they're usually a team of
Engineers maybe one go to market person
at a certain point in time and so we
co-create together and give them ideas
about how to create the foundations for
people and organizational success so
that as they grow when they do hire
people are Talent person that person is
successful but that said you do still
inherit kind of organizational debt
because even a company that's five or 10
people has made choices about how they
hire like cap tables still look silly
sometimes and so I would say like the
biggest mistake I've seen and I think
Tom I listened to a previous podcast you
had with Theory red Point Tom which I
was like clapping like mlau for the
people in the back the whole time I'm
listening to him because everything he
said made sense to me and he talked
about the notion of overleveling and I
want to underscore that one to the end
of time really oh yes yes okay so what
happens is companies equate I can't
compete with Fang now open AI comp
packages so the way I'm gonna win over
top talent is to Elevate their title to
X so everybody's ahead of something
everybody's a sea level there's no
company who needs a C Level anything
when they were a seed Stage Company like
they don't have the complexity and the
challenge that what happens is they give
these titles away like candy and then
when they realize the person's really
probably maybe at best a director or a
lead they have to they can't hire over
them the title's given away they can't
hire under them because nobody who's
truly at that level wants to report to
somebody that they think they should
probably be managing instead of the
inverse right and so ultimately what
happens is they fire people and some of
these people are good people essentially
people get terminated because they can't
figure out how to top them and so when
people are super self-aware sometimes
you can work it out where someone
changes roles within the organization
and gets topped But ultimately the
topping phenomenon is like a real
problem I think back to when we were at
webflow I remember I got hired as the
first executive so the co-founders all
had SE level titles this is very normal
the title is is really co-founder plus
whatever functional expertise is the
area and I came in as vpf people and I
was an SVP and I could have been like
well I want to stay with this level or
higher and take a bigger you know title
somewhere else but ultimately I had had
this great conversation with the former
chro at Salesforce and she said they did
not unlock the sea level titles until
they had basically gone public CFO was
the first one they unlocked a prep for
that everyone was today is a lot of big
titles but the company size and scale
matches and so I think about this notion
of we never had a sea level outside of
the founders at web flow until I left
and ultimately the company was
multi-billion dollar valuation 400 plus
people the whole thing and it wasn't
necessary to attract great talent you've
got to trct on the opportunity and the
job scope and the growth path and all of
that the other problem that happens if
even if they stay and they're able to be
that true C comp data is so readily
available today pave can be free to
anybody which is a great thing CA can be
free to anybody which is a great thing I
just saw they put out this you can send
in your title and get comp data back
Those comp data bits are based on people
who are experienced in seat and so you
could be going from being like a staff
engineer to a CTO and ask for CTO level
comp because your title is that
shouldn't you be paid for that and while
that feels really fair in theory what
ends up happening is now you're
overpaying essentially for the scope of
role that you're not getting and you're
hiring around it to buffer it so it's
this slippery slope of things that
happen to the extent that people can
keep titles relatively vague early days
anyone can call themselves ahead of
whatever they want to outside on the
internet but like keeping leveling like
really manageable on the inside and
thinking through upfront like what is
the scope of role and how can really
attract people I think is a huge thing
yeah so so the counter the counter to
that though is is the mark and dreon
like titles are cheap thing and I agree
with like sea level and VP like for
early stage I doesn't make any sense but
for me head of does because like it
implies like yeah you run this thing
today but like we can hire above you and
like there will be some sort of
conversation in the future as to if you
are this person or if we are going to
hire above you so I think I'm aligned
with you on CLE and VP but like head
feels like a easy free thing to give out
and it does Kick the Can a little bit
and it's it feels like it's just a
conversation it doesn't have this like
we can't hire above you phenomenon would
you agree with that or
disagree yeah I mean I used to really
detest the head of title because
internally it can be confusing because I
think about it as this it's like head of
content strategy when you're the only
content strategist versus like head of
engineering when you manage a team of 40
and then you invite head of engineering
to the leadership table but you don't
want to invite this IC to because it's
too many people it just that you need to
have Clarity internally about what you
mean when you think about these things
people need to have clear expectations
around what they're joining it feels
like a baiten switch if that
conversation's not held up front for a
candidate and then suddenly they're like
wait I thought I was join this company
with my path to being the SE suite and
now you're telling me it was just a free
title to give away attract me there's
the short-term wins you can think about
that get the candidate over the line but
what's the long-term retention path for
that person how are you going to invest
in them to help them grow I do use the
head of title quite frequently in
recommendations for companies usually as
a proxy for like director senior
director as a leveling when you need
maybe a first hire of a function who's
experienced enough to do it all handson
but then can grow out a team under them
and then by the time they do you decide
do you slot in as senior director or do
you slot in as something higher um and
that does work but I think it's
important to be transparent with the
person of we don't have leveling yet by
the time a year from now whatever it is
that we get to that let's have a
conversation about where you're really
performing and I'll be transparent with
you you be transparent with me and I
think the key is like being on the same
side of the table as your employees
versus using sneaky ways to win someone
over when you can't afford to pay and
and making it like a long-term
sustainable strategy you know I just
have to be honest what I what I think
about when I see the head of title like
the first thing that goes through my
head no pun is what's the story here
like what's what's the deal cuz
something is not clean clear this person
clearly wants to be a VP they're not
ready do they have you know be in their
Bonnet are they overconfident are they
hard to work what's going on like that
that's the first thing I think of when I
see the head of title yep and now the
counter to that so like I I would frame
that as like you're curious and you want
what the story is the counter to that is
is like we don't give out titles and so
you're manager of X and now when I'm
screening resumés you don't even get
past my screen if if I'm the recruiter
because I'm looking for somebody that
has director experience that's a great
point I will tell you in my 25 years in
doing this I personally have not come
across the use of a head of title
because a company doesn't give out
titles yeah it's I think it's a sto I
think it's a story thing and if I yeah
if I put myself in the candidate shoes
when it has come up it's it's really
interesting because this has come up
probably 15 or 20 times in the early
days of dord Dash andarta and when
people explained it to me I actually had
a lot more empathy than and that's why
I've change I've changed my mind on this
I also like exper I was like head of
before I got promoted to senior director
of door Dash and it still kept like the
head of title on the outside but when
people explain it to me of like hey I
need to be like in case I leave I want
to be able to say like my title
reflected my scope and my ownership
level and I think that that's kind of
fair because you know there's the
companies like ramp for example who it's
just like
operations and and you know if I didn't
know that about ramp and I was going
through resume screening I might skip
over somebody who could be you know
potentially incredible for the level of
scope that we were thinking about I
think I think it's a fair point I just
just look on this show we want to make
sure that everything that's out there
people are aware of and that's out there
yep all right Heather last so you also
have a take on on pedigree so tell us
what that is well that just goes right
back to the idea around like requiring
college degrees I can't tell you how
many will want someone specifically from
either McKenzie or BCG or whatever for
this kind of role or must have studied
at Harvard or Columbia or or whatever
else they need to have this set of
things and they look for those things as
proxy for maybe intelligence or ability
or whatever else and certainly there's
some you know benefit to maybe having
gone through the the school that is
McKenzie you learn a set of things right
and you're able to kind of present in a
certain way potentially but that is a
really uh limiting view of who maybe has
potential to be really effective at your
company and I'm just the the notion and
when people even talk about pedig it's
like a word that you Ed for like animals
and I just it just like kind of hurts my
soul a little bit when I think about it
like whenever I say it I say it in this
cringey way like when someone says like
Synergy there's certain words that just
make me kind of eek and pedigree is like
top of the list for me it's literally a
dog food brand isn't not literally a dog
food brand yes ex and not even the best
one but I think
ultimately this notion of I want almost
like a shortcut so I'm a big fan of
Daniel Conan may he rest in peace
thinking fast and slow all these bits
the human brain is just processing so
much information and ultimately you have
to take mental shortcuts in order to get
by and so people will see Harvard go oh
mental shortcut smart person and there
probably are they probably are right
there's a spectrum though of
intelligence there's different types of
intelligence and if you only ever
considered people from Harvard you are
missing out on the large majority of the
population who is intelligent and so
it's basically like using an umbrella
term to Think Through who you're willing
to give a chance to when ultimately
doing so you could be missing out on the
top talent that by the way also not
everyone else is going after at the same
time and so companies could get very
smart to think about other versions
other kind of categories or ways to
assess the competencies that they're
looking for in a job through interviews
or through other factors and ultimately
I think like one proxy that I really
like is like somebody who saw through a
company from like one stage to another
stage and they show some progression
within role and especially the like less
sexy Company brands like if you're in
recruiting for example and cool yeah you
worked at Airbnb or Google and that
makes you super great at recruiting but
also you had a whole brand behind you
that everybody wanted to work with you
worked for the hard to whatever fine
company that you've never heard of that
has a really weird product category
that's like maybe important but not
exciting to the common population and
you were able to grow that company from
 
looks really strong that ultimately the
company had a great outcome you are
probably 10x the the recruiter of the
person who worked at the other place and
I'm not like you know bad wording on on
the people who do come from those
companies because there's great talent
who come from all of them it's just a
really exclusive way to view the world
yeah and it's you know the thing I think
about is adversity and you know there's
the the old saying adversity builds
character and I actually have the
reverse bias on pedigree which is like
immediately when I see Harvard or
Stanford my wife went to Stanford so I'm
allowed to say this it's like what did
you have to go through like what where
was your hard path because like building
a company is the hardest path that we're
going to choose together and if you
haven't gone through it yet I don't want
to go through it with you for the first
time yeah I mean I think adversity is
relative and it shows up like it's kind
of like my closet I will fill whatever
space you give me and so ultimately my
version of adversity may not be as bad
as yours but there's no adversity
Olympics in my mind everyone has their
variations of things that they're going
to go through and it's valid for them
but I do think you can objectively look
at the things somebody did in the
context of what you need them for in a
job and see opportunity outside of the
bounds of what you really think about
and this is again where I'm so hopeful
of the future of AI and technology is
can we train these models to understand
the parallels in some of these pieces to
see things Beyond who is top talent that
has served up to you in the future could
look very different if they can start to
ingest these other signals that exist so
I'm pretty hopeful about it and by the
way and I totally disagree that AI will
replace jobs because think about the 80s
and I don't think you and I were yet in
the workforce in the 80s but my dad was
and I remember going with him to work on
take your daughter to work day he's a
lawyer there was no computer on his desk
in the 80s there was like a fax machine
a typewriter it was like not a common
thing and like the early 80s to have
that right and ultimately there weren't
less lawyers once computers came out
they just got faster what they did and
there were more applications and use
cases for legal teams and so like I hope
you're right I I really I really hope
you're right I've just seen some of this
powerful technology come out and I've
seen the way Founders are talking about
it and the way that Founders are talking
about it is I want people and that's the
thing that scares me I watch a lot of
these like historical fiction shows and
you'll see in all of them there's like a
whole bunch of dishwashers that's a
profession that you'd see in like all of
these shows and like servants like house
servants and it's the wealthy people
being served by these other people you
don't see nearly as many dishwashers
today as you used to see because the
invention of the dishwasher came out and
it did replace those jobs but it freed
up those people to do other kinds of
work like the unemployment rate doesn't
suddenly Go Up skyh High because
technology changes how people work it
just changes like what they might do and
spend their time on and I actually think
that AI is going to be much the same I
don't think we'll see a lot of data you
know like entry type roles going in the
future because those aren't really going
to be as needed but those people who
have computer skills might grow into
other things and how could they start to
do more like data analyst jobs or
writing or something else entirely so
that is the optimistic view of which
like I am I hoping you are right I
really am so with Heather thanks so much
for joining us we appreciate your time
thank you so much thank you my friend HR
