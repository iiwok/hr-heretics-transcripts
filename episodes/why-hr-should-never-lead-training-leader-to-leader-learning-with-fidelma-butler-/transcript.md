# Why HR Should Never Lead Training: Leader-to-Leader Learning with Fidelma Butler, Couchbase

## Transcript

[Music]
 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have Fidelma Butler on. Fidelma, you are
the chief people officer at Couchbase.
You had a long stint at Zenesk. Welcome
to the show. Grace, thank you so much.
So delighted to be here with Kelly and
Nolan. So we met at dinner a couple
weeks ago and then we caught up after
and we were talking about a couple days
L &amp; D and
engagement and friend of the pot David
Hanrahan was on maybe last month and was
like look I'm just starting a new chief
people officer gig. I'm actually
thinking a lot about L &amp; D. I haven't
seen it done super well. If anybody has
ideas let me know. And so that's the
genesis for this conversation, which I
tend to agree with David. I have not
seen L &amp;
D. I think when money was free, it was
really easy to just throw dollars at the
problem. You know, Google has more
classes than God for their employees.
How do you think about it given
Couchbase is a much different operation
than some of the larger tech companies?
Yeah, look, I think I would start with
saying that L &amp; D being done well is
just so tailored and nuanced to the size
and scale of the organization and the
challenges that you're trying to solve.
I actually know David very well. David
actually hired me into Zenesk and then
relocated me to the United States a few
years ago. He and I have spent a lot of
time in the past talking about this
particular topic.
I think for me coming into couch base
the beauty of it in one way and the
challenge was that there really was no
learning and development happening. So
this was about two and a quarter years
ago about 800 employees and post IPO. So
public company with decent headcount and
very very little learning and
development happening formally
throughout the organization. It was a
space that just really hadn't been
invested in. And I I mean that in terms
of dollars or time. And so having that
blank slate was daunting, but it was
also an opportunity to say, okay, what
does doing L &amp; D well look like for us
in this organization at this time. I
also think what makes doing L &amp; D well
quite hard is that the space is
continuously evolving. Like L &amp; D in
 
all of the myriad of AI tools that are
available to us with the competition
that we have computing for people's like
eyeball time on material and everything
else that's going on in the world. And
so to me, it's really about trying to
meet the particular moment of what your
organization needs. For us at Couchbase,
it became apparent to me early on that
we didn't have clear definitions of what
good performance looked like and what
good leadership looked like. So, how
could we do L &amp; D well if we weren't
defining what was a a solid leader well?
And for me, those leaders are the most
critical part of learning and
development. My team, any HR team,
right, it's only ever going to be so
big. we're never going to have all of
the dollars that we need for the
resources that we perhaps think that we
should have. And so for me, the people
leaders are the extension of the people
team. So I always want to focus there.
So step one for us at Couchbase was
let's define what does good leadership
mean here in this organization and then
design some programming on the back of
that. And now we're actually talking
about what what does the next phase look
like? Okay. And so I like the idea of
basically saying like you know what is
good leadership and what does top
performance look like here. Mhm. How did
you figure out the definition of good
leadership because I think every company
at some point runs into this problem
which is like I want great leaders and
it's like well like that means something
different to everybody. Like Elon thinks
about leaders one way versus you know
Larry at Google. So how did you guys go
about defining in that process? Yeah. So
I actually was very very fortunate to
bring director of learning and
development with me from a previous
organization. And so very quickly she
and I started having conversations with
the CEO as to when we have a solid
leader in this organization, somebody
who's performing above what we would
expect, what is it that they're bringing
to the table and what are they doing
differently? And we would colleate these
anecdotes that we were also hearing
across the organization of people
showing up particularly well in a
particular example
or stories of maybe people who didn't
work out and what did that entail. And
very quickly we realized that we could
ground it all in some language that she
and I had actually been using elsewhere
at the highest level and then adjusted
for couch base below that. And so we
went out to our executive team with this
particular model that defined leadership
in in three ways. Number one was how you
lead yourself, how you show up, how you
practice empathy, how you communicate
with integrity. Few other examples that
are quite specific to us within
that second attribute is how you lead
your team. So how you you know develop
them promote their career development
but also generate high performance from
them and then finally how you actually
lead couch base. So how you demonstrate
that you are creating that sustained
differentiation through the work that
you're doing how you're adding value how
you're operating crossf functionally. So
really trying to go after the things
that we were hearing the organization
particularly needed and the things that
those higher performers seemed to be
doing well. So now we had a language,
right? Now we had something that we
could bring into a talent review, but
also something that we could now start
to build some learning content on the
back of. Interesting. So you're you're
essentially like showing a it's like a
mirror, right? You're like you're like
flashing the mirror to saying this is
what we think is good or this is what
people are saying at least things are
good or what is good and then this is
also like what isn't good or what isn't
working out and then I'm assuming
there's some horse trading going on
there especially with the CEO because I
think often times with the CEO when you
show the mirror they're like actually no
no no like that is not good I do not
want that here and that actually helps
with the clarity process too. Yeah.
Yeah. Very much so. and he had done an
effort a few years before with my
predecessor to define the values of the
organization and very much felt that
deep ownership as to what we stand for
as an organization and there's six
values and three of them are about how
you create value for the organization
right so the things that you do to
unlock the best of couch base so for
example making tomorrow better than
today and then there are another three
which is how you you be valued so how do
we demonstrate to you that we value you.
One of those is serve your family as
defined by you. So for him very much
that that connection between the
leadership capabilities and the values
was his most important thing. He really
wanted to make sure that what we were
saying within the leadership
capabilities really referenced that and
he contributed to a number of the
examples that we used in that original
material. And then for the most part he
was like okay go for it. One of those
values that I mentioned make tomorrow
better than today. I love it because I'm
very much a let's launch version one and
if it's 80 to 90% right at this moment
then that's good enough and then we'll
tweak it and we'll iterate it and some
of them have undergone a couple of
changes at the more detailed level and
that's fine and they should and I think
that that's another area that you know
good L &amp; D to go back to your original
point L &amp; D done well is L &amp; D that is
continuously agile and there's a
learning that's needed in the learning
learning function. Yeah. I mean, it it
can get stale very quickly to your point
if you just kind of let it hang out on
the shelf. I love how you said language
because I wrote this down earlier and
I've never really been an L &amp; D fan. And
I think it was more semantics, you know
what I mean? Because I am an L &amp; D fan,
but the thing that made me agitated
about L &amp; D was like what all we all
struggle with it, right? Why it hasn't
worked or it's always been a challenge.
And I've been doing this 25 years and
it's always been a challenge. And it's
kind of similar to values to me. And I'm
like, why is this so hard? How come
everyone doesn't really like it or gets
frustrated or it doesn't really work?
And it's because it's kind of like
values and culture, right? It's very
squishy. You're trying to define
something that's very subjective that
changes and it's about humans and
behavior and not something that's like a
date or a number. And that's what makes
it uncomfortable for people.
And I love what you're doing because we
did the same thing with values at Pendo
kind of where I think that the L &amp; D
process can be as successful as it can
be when you try to go so deep that
you're making something very intangible
and squishy as tangible as possible.
Like this is actually what it looks
like. Like this is what happens. You
know, we use the Goldilocks approach at
Pendo, right? Like too much, too little,
and just enough. But like the ability to
have people be able to touch and feel it
is I think very critical to a great L &amp;
D program or activities or actions
because that that's why I've always been
uncomfortable with it. Like why isn't
this getting freaking better? Why is
this so hard? It's because everyone's
kind of hanging out in theoretical land.
Yeah. Hanging out in theoretical land
and in PowerPoint land and in kind of
corporate university land. Yeah. Lots of
triangles, lots of models.
Yeah. And look at look at how other
aspects of your life have changed. Right
now social media is about short quick
videos. I don't watch anything over 45
seconds long. Think about how impatient
you are if you go back to watching
regular TV and it comes time for the
adverts. I think part of the challenge
with the field of learning and
development traditionally has been that
it has forgotten that it needs to meet
people where they are. And at times it
can be well we're putting out these
programs and people aren't engaging with
them. And these programs are these big
huge vehicles that cost a lot of money
that take take people away from their
actual core work where they are creating
value. To go back to that language and
instead we've got to meet people where
they are and try and find ways to
compete with the eyeballs. Like people
will sit in meetings, right? They're
paying attention in the meeting. They're
on their laptop and they're getting
dinged on their phone. How do we compete
within that sphere? Right? So maybe that
is a podcast while people drive to work.
That's how I do a lot of learning,
listening to the likes of you and
others. Talking to other people in my
field, right? Learning can take many
forms. And I think unfortunately the
learning and development infrastructure
that exists out there can be very
oriented towards the the big playbooks
that made sense in the earlier part of
my career. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost like
I was thinking about this like before we
started. L &amp; D needs to be like a
product, right? You got to think about
it as a product for people in the
company that helps them remove friction
and yeah, remove friction and remove
stress, right? And they have to be
motivated to do that. So if I was
interviewing person, I would be like,
listen, what are the jobs to be done
with these people? Right? Just like you
said, what are the jobs to be done with
our leaders here? and how do we
productize our L &amp; D efforts to help
that get done in the fair way of the
jobs they're doing every day, right? So
they actually care about it and they see
it removing friction. So to take the
other side though, Kelly, right? Like
please, how how much of this is the
organization's
responsibility? And this is where I've
always struggled is like I find that the
best people are like Fidel, you're
saying like when I drive to work, I'm
listening to podcast. I do the same
thing. Kelly does the same thing, right?
I'm not expecting to show up to my
company and be like, "Okay, company, you
know, what L &amp; D do you have for me,
right? Like, put me through your
curriculum." So, I I struggle with this
because I'm like, so let me just I'll
I'll start with my my thesis on this. My
current thesis on what I think L &amp; D
should be is we optimize for the top,
call it 3 to 5% in the company and
that's it. And we go person by person.
So it's not this like you know
overarching big thing but we go person
by person and we say okay this is what
we see from you right now. These are the
gaps that you currently have and we're
going to design a bespoke solution to
help you fill those gaps. In some cases
it might be coaching. In some cases it
might be expanding that person's
network. In some cases it might be like
very specific hard skills that we need
to go get them. That's what I've been
thinking because if you if you optimize
for those people then a rising tide like
lifts all boats, right? they're going to
bring everyone else along with them.
Fidel, what's your take on that? And
then also then how are you thinking
about operationalizing at a couch base?
Yeah, look, I agree with you, Nolan. So
that's really my philosophy as to why I
go after leaders, right? And and by
leaders, I do mean all people leaders,
but then within the 200 or so people
leaders that we have, there are 60 that
are our senior leadership team. And in
terms of the cost of the training
interventions for them versus others,
yeah, it's weighted towards them. And so
if you are part of our senior leadership
team, you're probably doing coaching,
particularly if you've been here a while
or if we consider you to be a strong
talent. And in that coaching, then it's
much more personalized and tailored to
you. It is of course grounded in our
leadership capabilities, but we leave it
to you and to the executive that you
report into as to what you're going to
focus on. That said, I want to make sure
that there are learning and development
offerings for everybody in the
organization. So, you might be a new
manager. Great. We've got a program for
you. You might be under reppresented
talent and we work with a third party to
help you and we've got some coaching
opportunities there.
I think really that concept of figuring
out where you can have the most impact
and then over rotating your resources
towards those I think that is the way
forward because very often in learning
and development the dialogue has always
been about how do I quantify this right
how do I actually and and I can remember
things like the happy sheets did you
enjoy this training will this training
make a difference and it's complete
nonsense right it's complete nonsense
because really if you're taking somebody
out of what they're doing what they're
trying to achieve is that when they then
come back into doing their work that
something has changed that they're
either catching themselves before they
deliver a message in a certain way that
is less productive or that they are
starting a particular task with a fresh
perspective and we can't always measure
these things but I find that when we go
after the more senior leaders for
example we can actually start to see
correlating outcomes as to the
performance of their team how engaged
their team are even just the stories
that I start to hear amongst the
executive team here or the anecdotes
that start to rise up or from the people
partners saying what a great job one of
them did handling a difficult
conversation compared to a year ago and
I so I really I I agree with you in the
sense that if you go after those people
who have the biggest impact and you can
define that differently for your
organization that that's where really to
to rotate your resources towards and all
those anecdotes all those stories that
sometimes And people complain, well, it
can't be measured. That is I
tell everyone all the time, all those
stories and anecdotes that add up over
time, it is literally moving the glacier
of your company and you you can't even
feel it. Like, you don't even know it,
but it's like either moving it to an
advantage that's impacting your P&amp;L or
it's killing you. And I I just I've
argued with so many founder CEOs. I'm
like, you don't even understand. And
it's like impacting more than you think,
but it's not a line item on your P&amp;L,
but it's like always moving. It's always
like having an impact. Hey everyone,

that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR. That is until my
friend Heather Doce, who leads talented
signal fire, told me to check out
Metaview. I got into the product and was
like, "Wow, AI actually does exist in
recruiting." And this product is sick.
Metave is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for
recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions, and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. Metivview covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metave. Head over to
metav.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metabuse's product experts. Tell them
that me and Kelly sent you. Or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in minutes.
You mentioned engagement as like one of
the the vectors of of how you think
about it. So like how does that work? I
I'm also very skeptical on engagements
and I think it sometimes like is like
the tail wagging the dog because
oftentimes we send out these engagement
surveys and we don't do with them
other than just like look at them and
then you know it's I don't think the
employee base should be setting the
agenda of the people team. So how do you
kind of like weave those two things
together? So I agree with you somewhat.
So I am philosophically opposed to
surveying if you do not have the time,
the money, the people set aside
afterwards to do something about it. So
I can remember a few companies ago not
doing surveying because I knew that we
were we were pretty small and I knew
that you know the way we ran our
business was such that I needed to just
really focus on talent acquisition and a
few other areas
and it just I wasn't going to be able to
clear the decks to focus on what came
out of it. In my current company and in
my last company, I've been very clear
with people that we're only running this
survey if we're actually going to do
something with the outcomes. I
personally have stepped away from the
surveys that give you a badge for your
website. I think that that's fine if
that's what you're interested in, but
what I'm more interested in is the
survey that gives me the rich data of
the goss. So, here at Couchbase, we run
annual surveys. We did do a midyear
check-in and then we realized it wasn't
enough time because we're so focused on
the actions. But in going into any of
those surveys, we just closed one last
month. It's more so about the actions.
Like even the even the language that we
use subtly in our comms is less so about
the survey and it's more about the
actions. It's more of a case of we are
defining what we are going to focus on
and we need your say rather than like
the survey if that makes sense. When we
then get our survey outcomes, we define
actions at three levels. There's the
company actions which is what our CEO
Matt and I are really focused on. So
that might be systems and processes to
use an example from before, right? So
people are telling us there's big
problems in that area. Great, we can go
tackle that. Then there are the
functional level outcomes. So
engineering, what are the things that we
need to celebrate in engineering and
what are the things we need to go after?
And then there's the manager level. So
every manager who has I think it's five
or more responses within their team,
they can see some outcomes. Every
manager is expected to do one action, do
one thing. We don't make it into a big
administrative overhead of telling us
what that is, but you're constantly
being told that this is the expectation.
So, we've got those three levels. We've
got the company level things, we've got
the functional level, and then we've got
things at the managerial level. That
then becomes the structure when I'm
presenting the results, which I did a
few weeks ago. I spent more time on
that. Right? Here's what we did at a
company level since the last time.
Here's what we're going to do going
forward. Here's an example of some
functional stuff. I spent more time on
that than I did on the actual numbers,
if that makes sense. The numbers are
very helpful, right? But it's more so
about the actions that then drives the
strategy for my own people and workplace
team. And on a quarterly basis, we have
an equivalent of a QBR. We call it an
observ meeting with the rest of the
executive team. And I will literally
give an update on projects that we're
doing across all of those and some other
stuff as well. And so it becomes part of
the narrative of the organization and at
our quarterly all hands whenever I'm
presenting I will put that work in
context of the company outcomes as well.
So the surveys have been really
actionoriented for us. If I go back to
the learning and development topic, one
of the things that was very helpful to
us the first time we did one of these
surveys after I joined was in getting
after that definition of leadership. So
we had leaders for example who lead
couch base very very well and lead
themselves very well right they're super
articulate they know the product they're
doing really good things when it came to
the engagement outcomes as it pertain to
lead the team less good so the questions
are things like my manager keeps me
informed my manager gives me regular
feedback and so forth and it was really
interesting to see these people who we
would have thought would be strong
across the board actually have you So
green, maybe a little amber, maybe a
little red, green, you know, as you
think about the entire breath of
leadership. And so that was very very
helpful for us. And then hey, that's a
that's an easy intervention for a good
learning and development team. Go talk
to that person, acknowledge with them
that they might be disappointed in what
those outcomes are, but it's okay and
we're here to help you, and here's how
we are going to help you. So for me
there is a real connection between that
data that I get from engagement and how
I can tie it back into evaluating our
proficiency with defining and delivering
quality leaders in the organization.
What happens when there's
disagreement between the narrative of
the engagement survey and the top-down
initiatives from the CEO? That's
interesting. I'm not sure that that has
been Do you have an example on that,
Nolan? Like what do you Yeah, an example
would be
like I think right now like everyone's
talking about
intensity burnout, like we're too
hardcore, like that. Like every
early stage company I'm talking to right
now is doing some version of 996, right?
 
Again, I think it's stupid, but like
that is the tech world that we're
currently in. And so I think there's a
lot of this sentiment from employees
that's like this is too much or like I'm
burnt out or I'm tired or there's a lot
of like fatigue in the org which I
actually don't know if it's much if it's
org driven or if it's more personal. I I
think there's a lot to discuss there
which is with society today but then
like maybe the CEO is like I actually
don't think we're intense enough.
Yeah. I'll give you an example. So that
particular example hasn't been relevant
to us. But one thing that has shown up
for us is employees wanting to know more
and more and more about company
strategy, our messaging, which we
revised a few months ago, our
positioning in the competitive
landscape, what all of that looks
like. And there have definitely been
moments where I've thought, but hang on,
like we just had kickoff, right? We do a
sales kickoff. We just had kickoff for
the whole company. And I think as HR
leaders and and as learning and
development leaders, I think we can
often be guilty of but we told them and
we told them and we told them again like
we did all of that. But actually, if you
take a step back, no, it's incumbent
upon me to deliver that message
differently because it's clearly not
reaching everybody in the way they need
it all of the time. So maybe I'm pushing
all of that information out in the
quarterly all hands, but hey, maybe
somebody can just never join that
because of their time zone. So maybe
I've got to find ways to share some
byite-size content on Slack. That's all
part of learning and development. And
that content can help to bridge some of
that gap. Just today we were talking
about how we can leverage that senior
leadership team, that top 60 leaders in
the organization and get them to
disseminate more of this information on
that particular topic, right? Rather
than it always seeming to be something
that Matt needs to do or that other
executives need to do. And so I think if
you are doing L &amp; D well, when you get
something like that that feels at odds
with what you think you've put out
there, you actually need to reframe the
problem as how can I do this
differently? What can I go and do? I had
a leader say to me in January like this
just there's no interview training. My
guys don't know how to interview. And I
was like that training that we lost that
we launched about three months ago and
many of them have participated in that.
You just haven't seen it. This is a busy
sales leader. Yes, we had put it out in
every Slack message. We had even put it
directly on some people's calendars and
before we made it mandatory for all
interviewers, we were doing a kind of
free-for-all. He just hadn't seen it.
He's just super busy, right? So, fine,
right? I'm not going to argue with him
that he missed it, that yes, we already
have it. The better answer, the more
kind of business partnering oriented
answer is, yeah, we have that. It's
ready to go. How would you like us to
deliver that to your team? Do you want
to break them up into small groups? We
can get them together. Do you want them
to join the open sessions? That's how
you actually meet people where they are.
Yeah, I like all of that. I really do
because that's how I think about it.
Engagement, survey, actions,
communications, L &amp; D. I was just
talking to someone about this. Trying to
make it and weave it in as much as you
can to the fairway of the job and the
dayto-day. It just works. And I think
that's the problem with I think the
semantic of L &amp; D. We should probably
call it something different because when
you think of L &amp; D, you think about
something extra. Taking them off the
line, taking them out of the job, paying
a bunch of money, listening to a
facilitator from a fancy consulting
group. Like that's how it's always been.
And that's really not what it is. Like I
told someone at Quizlet, I'm like,
"Guess what? L &amp; D is going to be the
fair way of the job. We are going to
leverage leaders teaching leaders
because no one listens to HR. We're
going to help the best like we are going
to make this a part of the gig where you
don't feel like you're going to traffic
school on a Saturday, you know, and it
just works. It's worked really well. And
they're all like, "Yeah, nodding." And
again, back to it being a product, it
helps them remove friction to get their
jobs done better. Yeah, you you nailed
the leaders teaching leaders thing,
Kelly. So, we've heard that twice on the
show. So one's from Brian Power and then
the other one from Valentina Gon. And in
both of those cases, the thing I took
away was like yeah, like I actually
think leaders teaching other leaders is
the best way for it to sit in. And like
I would listen to that versus like you
know HR shows up and I'm like like you
know everyone's eyes like immediately
roll like all right well they're
operating on HR island and everyone else
like is actually like trying to drive
revenue for the business. So Fella how
do you guys think about like do you
engage your leaders to teach?
Absolutely. So we get that senior
leadership team together on a quarterly
basis and of course I usually have
something to say and of course we have
our CEO kick it off but I'm thinking of
a recent example where one of the team
actually raised his hand to say I want
to do something around people taking
accountability right and I want to talk
to my peers about how we can drive some
more of that so he came in and he
presented on that topic got some input
from the group and now he's actually
working on something that we will use in
a learning and development capacity with
my team. So yes, I find that very very
valuable. At our sales
kickoff, I brought up on stage four
employees who have had great career
development, right? Lateral as well as
moving up the ladder here at Couchbase
and people really valued hearing their
perspectives. They could have listened
to me for 45 minutes, right? talking at
them about career development and what
they need to do, but actually listening
to those people that you respect, those
people that you know, those people that
you had a drink with the night before.
That's where I think people took a lot
of value. So, as much as possible, like
take yourself out of it. I think that
that is very very true. Yeah, that makes
a ton of sense. You had mentioned
coaching earlier as well.
So I the coaching kind of similar to
what Kelly's been saying about
nomenclature. I think for some people
they've you know I think for like I'm a
former athlete it's like oh my god like
makes a ton of sense right? Serena
Williams best tennis player in the world
has a coach. Tiger Woods best golfer in
the world has a coach. Shouldn't we all
have coaches? But then you kind of get
these like poor examples of it that I
think dilutes what it should be. So how
do you guys think about coaching? Where
do you deploy it? What does it look
like? Yeah. So for us it is those most
senior leaders.
So a couple of years ago we started with
a subset of them participating in a
leadership program. It's through
sounding board.
And I think by now we've had maybe 40 of
the 60 if not a little bit more who have
participated in it. I think we've had
one or two cases where people have
actually changed their coaches, right?
Where they have felt, you know what, I
need to get a better fit here. And
Serena did that. She changed from
Patrick Moratic. She needed to, right?
But I think where coaching has helped us
is that when I take a step back and I
look across
leaders, it's never really their
technical knowledge. It's never really
their experience that holds them back,
but it's maybe their ability to deliver
a conversation in a certain way. Maybe
it's their ability to make it seem like
they're not nervous when they're talking
to a large group of people, to command
an audience, to have executive presence.
It tends to be those intangible, the
unmeasurable, immeasurable things. But
that's where coaching has really helped
with us is, you know, we've encouraged
them to really go after those aspects,
the things that they find particularly
hard, the things that they get feedback
on. So, of course, like a lot of
coaching platforms, there's a survey
beforehand, right? How good is the
people at all of these things? And our
leadership capabilities are in there,
but also a bunch of other very specific
things. And then they go forth with
their coach. We've had a number of
examples of people wanting to continue
with their coach and in many cases we've
been able to facilitate that. We also
then have another program through torch
which is targeted at underrepresented
talent. Now everybody can apply but we
particularly encourage talent of any
level who identifies as
underrepresented. And so again this
might be good for you if you want to
actually have some one-on-one time with
a coach. In that particular piece you
also meet with your group. So you go
through it as a cohort. You might have a
session
on I don't know confidence while
presenting to an executive team led by
one of their coaches. Bit of Q&amp;A my team
are there. Then you go off and you do
some work with your coach. Then you come
back a few months later there's another
one of those meetings and so on and so
forth. And throughout all of that
journey you're meeting with different
members of the executive team as well.
And so it's worked well for us with that
population as well because, you know,
this one-sizefits-all approach, it's
just not really the answer. It's not the
modern answer anymore. You know, we all
want to have diverse workforces in every
single way. Well, we all learn
differently, right? We all consume
information differently. We all just
have different needs and different
energy levels. And so that's really what
we've been able to find with coaching is
that it can deliver that personalized
piece and then I can correlate
engagement outcomes with did this person
attend did this person attend any of our
leadership programming. Obviously it's
all anonymized within culture but in the
same way as it tracks what region you're
in. It tracks at a highest level for me
at a very high level. Here are the
outcomes for leaders who've participated
in programs and the ones who haven't. So
Delma, my last question for you is
really what do you think this means for
L &amp; D talent going forward, right? I
mean, do you see the role changing, the
title changing? Do you interview
differently now when you start hiring L
&amp; D folks? Where do you think it's
going? Well, I'll actually take a bit of
a detour into the past. So when I
started my career in consulting, it was
learning and development attached to
systems implementations, right? So, it
was about the change curve and we would
have all of these spreadsheets of these
different groups of people and where
might they be on the change curve, where
did we need to get them to, what level
of knowledge would they have? Then we
would go and create all of these massive
PowerPoint decks, take them away from
their day job, and then expect them to
absorb all of this change and behave
differently. And even in my own
training, like we were flown to Chicago
for two weeks at a time to do like super
intense training and and then back to
the day job it was, you know, your head
is still spinning. So that was kind of
the way learning and development used to
be. And then there became this big
movement around hiring instructional
designers, right? And it all being
really about the design and the look and
feel and that that was very important.
And then there became this big movement
around strengths and I think it got a
little bit overrotated to that right
because most of the time we're trying to
develop people on their areas of
opportunity. Then we kind of segueed
into skills and skills were the big
thing in learning and development a few
years ago. But work isn't organized
around skills, right? It's organized
around groups of related tasks that need
to get done, right? So that's how
obviously there are there you're
obviously learning skills all of the
time and developing people's skills, but
it just didn't necessarily tally with
the way people were structuring their
work. But I do remember one particular
movement in learning and development in
leadership content about maybe five,
six, seven years ago. It was all around
VUO, this volatile, uncertain world that
we were now living in. And I remember
that being a dominant topic throughout
all of the leadership material that most
organizations were putting out there.
And then came resilience as well. And I
actually think that for the most part
the learning and development function
got that right because now when I'm
thinking about a learning and
development function well yeah
everything around us is volatile. So our
learning and development needs to just
be massively agile, right? It needs to
be always learning itself and always
thinking of how can I help these people
to adjust their behavior and create more
value while they are so consumed with
doing their role and doing it in a world
in which there's increased volatility at
a macro level and elsewhere and that's
really testing their skills of
resilience and everything else. And so
it's a long way of answering your
question, but for me what am I thinking
about when I hire these people? It's do
they get that right? Do they want to go
away and build PowerPoint decks for a
few hours at a time or are they thinking
about what are the new tools that are
coming down the line in this space that
can help me to get learning content in
front of people on Slack for example or
when they log in in the morning a
question of like have you given feedback
today whatever it is those are the
skills that I'm looking for and within
our team here you know we have people
who have learning and development
diversity equity inclusion and
engagement ment backgrounds and they're
all mingled together within the team.
We're going to more formally have them
all start to lean into each other's work
a little bit because all of those things
to me are just so highly correlated. I
love that. The last one for me, Fidelma,
is actually around getting it wrong. So
like it's it seems like you you are very
well put together on the way you're
thinking about this. You're engaging the
business, right? We're launching very
quickly. We're not launching perfect
solutions, but I think a lot of people
who have tried this have at at some
point in time been punched in the face
with like that one didn't land. Do you
have an example of that and then how you
learn from it and then how you move
forward? Yeah, I think the toughest area
in all of this is actually meeting
people where they are in terms of career
development. And that's one that several
times over the course of my career I've
felt a bit punched in the face because
people will always say in every
interaction that you have whether that's
a survey or anything else that they want
more career development. Totally never
ending. Two sales kickoffs ago, I stood
on the stage and I said, "Who wants
career development?" Every hand in the
room goes up. Okay. Who's done a
development plan? A smattering of hands
go up, right? And that can actually
sting. It's like why am I designing all
of these tools, building these tools,
and putting them out there? So, there
have been times where, and I I'm going
through that now, where I'm thinking,
okay, how can I actually give people
what they need? I think that people are
asking in that example for how can I get
to the next level, right? And as a
professional in this space, I'm thinking
no, how can you be ready for the next
opportunity? Whether that is up across a
stretch whatever cross functional
doesn't matter that the career model of
the past isn't necessarily the career
model that I think is needed in the
future but not everybody is on board
with that yet people are thinking about
how can I get to the next level the next
level the next level well there has to
be an opportunity it has to be at the
right time you have to be ready that can
be hard for people to quantify to take
right people want actual timelines and
so that is something that I have not
cracked that nut yet and if anybody has
I'd love to hear it. I think that can be
quite hard. I am a huge disbeliever in
those spreadsheets that very often are
produced within people teams of the
different levels and then like the
behaviors that are needed at each level
and the verb changes. You know, it's
give guidance on blleh lead blah as you
go up the levels. It'll become a
checkbox exercise. No one's learning
from that. Your lower performers are
using that to tick the boxes to then
say, "Please promote me." Your higher
performers are like, "That's of course
I'm doing that." Like that that doesn't
need to be
specified. And I just don't know that we
have fully cracked that nut. And in
particular, what we're trying to do as
learning and development professionals
at the moment is prepare people for
careers that don't look anything like
what they look like today. You know,
there are people graduating colleges
over the next few months who are heading
into the world of work who will be doing
very different things to what they
thought they would be doing when they
made those choices. And the same is true
of tenur professionals as well. So that
is the piece where I have definitely
found challenge. Nolan, I think real
talk, I think we have another semantics
issue with employees using career
development because when you say that
automatically they think of more money
and a higher title. That's what it is.
So, which I love. We should just call it
that. I'd be like, "Hey, who wants to
learn about how to get promoted here?
Let's do that. Who wants to learn about
comp and how you can make more money and
how we think about comp here? Let's do
that." So, I feel like that that whole
bucket itself needs to be
stratified because that's been a big
like misinterpretation in my career when
I say career development. And I think it
still happens that employees think about
that differently than we think about
that. You guys are both right about
this, which is like on the career
development piece. This is probably why
I'm both I'm super jaded on the topic is
because Fidelma, you you nailed it,
which is like the checkbox exercise,
right? People lower in the org show up
and they go, I did it. Where's my promo?
And and then I think ultimately I've
seen so many organizations become
promotion obsessed. Yes. That like I
like lose my mind about it because I'm
like this is we're here. This is not
about getting promotion. Like of course
like we want to make sure people
progress they're getting paid very well
obviously fairly is the floor but then
of it's like very well as they perform
well in the organization and man I I'm
really starting to think like the big
issue with this Kelly is actually the
ladders and how we come up with ladders
and how we do ladders and that's where I
think people get jaded but I struggle
you both of you what's the alternative I
know you're flattening it you can't have
nothing because I started at high growth
companies and there was nothing. It was
 chaos. Like, I'll take the
ladders right now. Just I don't know
what the alternative is and maybe there
will never be a perfect
answer. But I think what has worked is
just trying to do these squishy things
as transparently and raw and direct as
you can with employees. That
works. That that works. And even if it's
uncomfortable and messy, it works better
than engagement and career ladders and
surveys. You know what I mean? Like you
can at least get further with them when
you're just kind of real about it. Speak
their language. And you said it earlier,
meet them where they are. It's amazing
what a real conversation can do, right?
In every aspect of everything. like a
real conversation about what are you
actually trying to achieve? Yeah, I just
did this story with my wife. I was like,
what is this really about?
Yeah, I'm a big believer in hiring
adults and then really treating them
like adults, right? So, to my point
earlier of, well, who's filled in career
development plan? Like, there's a huge
amount of accountability that needs to
be taken here. I'm not going to spoon
feed you. I'm not going to go out there
and say you didn't come to XYZ training.
You had that opportunity. And frankly,
the people who are going to get
recognized and are going to experience
the career development piece are the
people who are leaning into all of those
and who are recognized as taking
accountability and taking their
opportunities when they come and then
the rewards then follow that. It's not
that you as HR is sitting there with a,
you know, magic wand being like, you
attended this, you're getting promoted.
You didn't you, it actually shows up in
a bunch of different ways. Filma, this
has been great. Where can people find
you? Sure. Well, like everybody, they
can find me on LinkedIn and reach out to
me there. Happy to connect with
everybody. And it's been a pleasure
chatting to you all today. I'm very
aware that I'm speaking from a very
empty room. We're actually moving our
headquarters over the next few days,
which is also a project that's on my I
thought you were in like a CIA black
sites. It's like totally like it's good
to know you're still in a conference
room. Yeah, that's cool. I should have
done this a week later when we were in
our really cool office at Santana. Thank
you so much for the time, Fidelma. All
right, thanks. Thank you both. HR
