So delighted to be here with Kelly and
Nolan. So we met at dinner a couple
 
Nolan. So we met at dinner a couple
weeks ago and then we caught up after
 
weeks ago and then we caught up after
and we were talking about a couple days
 
and we were talking about a couple days
L &amp; D and
 
L &amp; D and
engagement and friend of the pot David
 
engagement and friend of the pot David
Hanrahan was on maybe last month and was
 
Hanrahan was on maybe last month and was
like look I'm just starting a new chief
 
like look I'm just starting a new chief
people officer gig. I'm actually
 
people officer gig. I'm actually
thinking a lot about L &amp; D. I haven't
 
thinking a lot about L &amp; D. I haven't
seen it done super well. If anybody has
 
seen it done super well. If anybody has
ideas let me know. And so that's the
 
ideas let me know. And so that's the
genesis for this conversation, which I
 
genesis for this conversation, which I
tend to agree with David. I have not
 
tend to agree with David. I have not
seen L &amp;
 
seen L &amp;
D. I think when money was free, it was
 
D. I think when money was free, it was
really easy to just throw dollars at the
 
really easy to just throw dollars at the
problem. You know, Google has more
 
problem. You know, Google has more
classes than God for their employees.
 
classes than God for their employees.
How do you think about it given
 
How do you think about it given
Couchbase is a much different operation
 
Couchbase is a much different operation
than some of the larger tech companies?
 
than some of the larger tech companies?
Yeah, look, I think I would start with
 
Yeah, look, I think I would start with
saying that L &amp; D being done well is
 
saying that L &amp; D being done well is
just so tailored and nuanced to the size
 
just so tailored and nuanced to the size
and scale of the organization and the
 
and scale of the organization and the
challenges that you're trying to solve.
 
challenges that you're trying to solve.
I actually know David very well. David
 
I actually know David very well. David
actually hired me into Zenesk and then
 
actually hired me into Zenesk and then
relocated me to the United States a few
 
relocated me to the United States a few
years ago. He and I have spent a lot of
 
years ago. He and I have spent a lot of
time in the past talking about this
 
time in the past talking about this
particular topic.
 
particular topic.
I think for me coming into couch base
 
I think for me coming into couch base
the beauty of it in one way and the
 
the beauty of it in one way and the
challenge was that there really was no
 
challenge was that there really was no
learning and development happening. So
 
learning and development happening. So
this was about two and a quarter years
 
this was about two and a quarter years
ago about 800 employees and post IPO. So
 
ago about 800 employees and post IPO. So
public company with decent headcount and
 
public company with decent headcount and
very very little learning and
 
very very little learning and
development happening formally
 
development happening formally
throughout the organization. It was a
 
throughout the organization. It was a
space that just really hadn't been
 
space that just really hadn't been
invested in. And I I mean that in terms
 
invested in. And I I mean that in terms
of dollars or time. And so having that
 
of dollars or time. And so having that
blank slate was daunting, but it was
 
blank slate was daunting, but it was
also an opportunity to say, okay, what
 
also an opportunity to say, okay, what
does doing L &amp; D well look like for us
 
does doing L &amp; D well look like for us
in this organization at this time. I
 
in this organization at this time. I
also think what makes doing L &amp; D well
 
also think what makes doing L &amp; D well
quite hard is that the space is
 
quite hard is that the space is
continuously evolving. Like L &amp; D in
 
continuously evolving. Like L &amp; D in
 
all of the myriad of AI tools that are
 
all of the myriad of AI tools that are
available to us with the competition
 
available to us with the competition
that we have computing for people's like
 
that we have computing for people's like
eyeball time on material and everything
 
eyeball time on material and everything
else that's going on in the world. And
 
else that's going on in the world. And
so to me, it's really about trying to
 
so to me, it's really about trying to
meet the particular moment of what your
 
meet the particular moment of what your
organization needs. For us at Couchbase,
 
organization needs. For us at Couchbase,
it became apparent to me early on that
 
it became apparent to me early on that
we didn't have clear definitions of what
 
we didn't have clear definitions of what
good performance looked like and what
 
good performance looked like and what
good leadership looked like. So, how
 
good leadership looked like. So, how
could we do L &amp; D well if we weren't
 
could we do L &amp; D well if we weren't
defining what was a a solid leader well?
 
defining what was a a solid leader well?
And for me, those leaders are the most
 
And for me, those leaders are the most
critical part of learning and
 
critical part of learning and
development. My team, any HR team,
 
development. My team, any HR team,
right, it's only ever going to be so
 
right, it's only ever going to be so
big. we're never going to have all of
 
big. we're never going to have all of
the dollars that we need for the
 
the dollars that we need for the
resources that we perhaps think that we
 
resources that we perhaps think that we
should have. And so for me, the people
 
should have. And so for me, the people
leaders are the extension of the people
 
leaders are the extension of the people
team. So I always want to focus there.
 
team. So I always want to focus there.
So step one for us at Couchbase was
 
So step one for us at Couchbase was
let's define what does good leadership
 
let's define what does good leadership
mean here in this organization and then
 
mean here in this organization and then
design some programming on the back of
 
design some programming on the back of
that. And now we're actually talking
 
that. And now we're actually talking
about what what does the next phase look
 
about what what does the next phase look
like? Okay. And so I like the idea of
 
like? Okay. And so I like the idea of
basically saying like you know what is
 
basically saying like you know what is
good leadership and what does top
 
good leadership and what does top
performance look like here. Mhm. How did
 
performance look like here. Mhm. How did
you figure out the definition of good
 
you figure out the definition of good
leadership because I think every company
 
leadership because I think every company
at some point runs into this problem
 
at some point runs into this problem
which is like I want great leaders and
 
which is like I want great leaders and
it's like well like that means something
 
it's like well like that means something
different to everybody. Like Elon thinks
 
different to everybody. Like Elon thinks
about leaders one way versus you know
 
about leaders one way versus you know
Larry at Google. So how did you guys go
 
Larry at Google. So how did you guys go
about defining in that process? Yeah. So
 
about defining in that process? Yeah. So
I actually was very very fortunate to
 
I actually was very very fortunate to
bring director of learning and
 
bring director of learning and
development with me from a previous
 
development with me from a previous
organization. And so very quickly she
 
organization. And so very quickly she
and I started having conversations with
 
and I started having conversations with
the CEO as to when we have a solid
 
the CEO as to when we have a solid
leader in this organization, somebody
 
leader in this organization, somebody
who's performing above what we would
 
who's performing above what we would
expect, what is it that they're bringing
 
expect, what is it that they're bringing
to the table and what are they doing
 
to the table and what are they doing
differently? And we would colleate these
 
differently? And we would colleate these
anecdotes that we were also hearing
 
anecdotes that we were also hearing
across the organization of people
 
across the organization of people
showing up particularly well in a
 
showing up particularly well in a
particular example
 
particular example
or stories of maybe people who didn't
 
or stories of maybe people who didn't
work out and what did that entail. And
 
work out and what did that entail. And
very quickly we realized that we could
 
very quickly we realized that we could
ground it all in some language that she
 
ground it all in some language that she
and I had actually been using elsewhere
 
and I had actually been using elsewhere
at the highest level and then adjusted
 
at the highest level and then adjusted
for couch base below that. And so we
 
for couch base below that. And so we
went out to our executive team with this
 
went out to our executive team with this
particular model that defined leadership
 
particular model that defined leadership
in in three ways. Number one was how you
 
in in three ways. Number one was how you
lead yourself, how you show up, how you
 
lead yourself, how you show up, how you
practice empathy, how you communicate
 
practice empathy, how you communicate
with integrity. Few other examples that
 
with integrity. Few other examples that
are quite specific to us within
 
are quite specific to us within
that second attribute is how you lead
 
that second attribute is how you lead
your team. So how you you know develop
 
your team. So how you you know develop
them promote their career development
 
them promote their career development
but also generate high performance from
 
but also generate high performance from
them and then finally how you actually
 
them and then finally how you actually
lead couch base. So how you demonstrate
 
lead couch base. So how you demonstrate
that you are creating that sustained
 
that you are creating that sustained
differentiation through the work that
 
differentiation through the work that
you're doing how you're adding value how
 
you're doing how you're adding value how
you're operating crossf functionally. So
 
you're operating crossf functionally. So
really trying to go after the things
 
really trying to go after the things
that we were hearing the organization
 
that we were hearing the organization
particularly needed and the things that
 
particularly needed and the things that
those higher performers seemed to be
 
those higher performers seemed to be
doing well. So now we had a language,
 
doing well. So now we had a language,
right? Now we had something that we
 
right? Now we had something that we
could bring into a talent review, but
 
could bring into a talent review, but
also something that we could now start
 
also something that we could now start
to build some learning content on the
 
to build some learning content on the
back of. Interesting. So you're you're
 
back of. Interesting. So you're you're
essentially like showing a it's like a
 
essentially like showing a it's like a
mirror, right? You're like you're like
 
mirror, right? You're like you're like
flashing the mirror to saying this is
 
flashing the mirror to saying this is
what we think is good or this is what
 
what we think is good or this is what
people are saying at least things are
 
people are saying at least things are
good or what is good and then this is
 
good or what is good and then this is
also like what isn't good or what isn't
 
also like what isn't good or what isn't
working out and then I'm assuming
 
working out and then I'm assuming
there's some horse trading going on
 
there's some horse trading going on
there especially with the CEO because I
 
there especially with the CEO because I
think often times with the CEO when you
 
think often times with the CEO when you
show the mirror they're like actually no
 
show the mirror they're like actually no
no no like that is not good I do not
 
no no like that is not good I do not
want that here and that actually helps
 
want that here and that actually helps
with the clarity process too. Yeah.
 
with the clarity process too. Yeah.
Yeah. Very much so. and he had done an
 
Yeah. Very much so. and he had done an
effort a few years before with my
 
effort a few years before with my
predecessor to define the values of the
 
predecessor to define the values of the
organization and very much felt that
 
organization and very much felt that
deep ownership as to what we stand for
 
deep ownership as to what we stand for
as an organization and there's six
 
as an organization and there's six
values and three of them are about how
 
values and three of them are about how
you create value for the organization
 
you create value for the organization
right so the things that you do to
 
right so the things that you do to
unlock the best of couch base so for
 
unlock the best of couch base so for
example making tomorrow better than
 
example making tomorrow better than
today and then there are another three
 
today and then there are another three
which is how you you be valued so how do
 
which is how you you be valued so how do
we demonstrate to you that we value you.
 
we demonstrate to you that we value you.
One of those is serve your family as
 
One of those is serve your family as
defined by you. So for him very much
 
defined by you. So for him very much
that that connection between the
 
that that connection between the
leadership capabilities and the values
 
leadership capabilities and the values
was his most important thing. He really
 
was his most important thing. He really
wanted to make sure that what we were
 
wanted to make sure that what we were
saying within the leadership
 
saying within the leadership
capabilities really referenced that and
 
capabilities really referenced that and
he contributed to a number of the
 
he contributed to a number of the
examples that we used in that original
 
examples that we used in that original
material. And then for the most part he
 
material. And then for the most part he
was like okay go for it. One of those
 
was like okay go for it. One of those
values that I mentioned make tomorrow
 
values that I mentioned make tomorrow
better than today. I love it because I'm
 
better than today. I love it because I'm
very much a let's launch version one and
 
very much a let's launch version one and
if it's 80 to 90% right at this moment
 
if it's 80 to 90% right at this moment
then that's good enough and then we'll
 
then that's good enough and then we'll
tweak it and we'll iterate it and some
 
tweak it and we'll iterate it and some
of them have undergone a couple of
 
of them have undergone a couple of
changes at the more detailed level and
 
changes at the more detailed level and
that's fine and they should and I think
 
that's fine and they should and I think
that that's another area that you know
 
that that's another area that you know
good L &amp; D to go back to your original
 
good L &amp; D to go back to your original
point L &amp; D done well is L &amp; D that is
 
point L &amp; D done well is L &amp; D that is
continuously agile and there's a
 
continuously agile and there's a
learning that's needed in the learning
 
learning that's needed in the learning
learning function. Yeah. I mean, it it
 
learning function. Yeah. I mean, it it
can get stale very quickly to your point
 
can get stale very quickly to your point
if you just kind of let it hang out on
 
if you just kind of let it hang out on
the shelf. I love how you said language
 
the shelf. I love how you said language
because I wrote this down earlier and
 
because I wrote this down earlier and
I've never really been an L &amp; D fan. And
 
I've never really been an L &amp; D fan. And
I think it was more semantics, you know
 
I think it was more semantics, you know
what I mean? Because I am an L &amp; D fan,
 
what I mean? Because I am an L &amp; D fan,
but the thing that made me agitated
 
but the thing that made me agitated
about L &amp; D was like what all we all
 
about L &amp; D was like what all we all
struggle with it, right? Why it hasn't
 
struggle with it, right? Why it hasn't
worked or it's always been a challenge.
 
worked or it's always been a challenge.
And I've been doing this 25 years and
 
And I've been doing this 25 years and
it's always been a challenge. And it's
 
it's always been a challenge. And it's
kind of similar to values to me. And I'm
 
kind of similar to values to me. And I'm
like, why is this so hard? How come
 
like, why is this so hard? How come
everyone doesn't really like it or gets
 
everyone doesn't really like it or gets
frustrated or it doesn't really work?
 
frustrated or it doesn't really work?
And it's because it's kind of like
 
And it's because it's kind of like
values and culture, right? It's very
 
values and culture, right? It's very
squishy. You're trying to define
 
squishy. You're trying to define
something that's very subjective that
 
something that's very subjective that
changes and it's about humans and
 
changes and it's about humans and
behavior and not something that's like a
 
behavior and not something that's like a
date or a number. And that's what makes
 
date or a number. And that's what makes
it uncomfortable for people.
 
it uncomfortable for people.
And I love what you're doing because we
 
And I love what you're doing because we
did the same thing with values at Pendo
 
did the same thing with values at Pendo
kind of where I think that the L &amp; D
 
kind of where I think that the L &amp; D
process can be as successful as it can
 
process can be as successful as it can
be when you try to go so deep that
 
be when you try to go so deep that
you're making something very intangible
 
you're making something very intangible
and squishy as tangible as possible.
 
and squishy as tangible as possible.
Like this is actually what it looks
 
Like this is actually what it looks
like. Like this is what happens. You
 
like. Like this is what happens. You
know, we use the Goldilocks approach at
 
know, we use the Goldilocks approach at
Pendo, right? Like too much, too little,
 
Pendo, right? Like too much, too little,
and just enough. But like the ability to
 
and just enough. But like the ability to
have people be able to touch and feel it
 
have people be able to touch and feel it
is I think very critical to a great L &amp;
 
is I think very critical to a great L &amp;
D program or activities or actions
 
D program or activities or actions
because that that's why I've always been
 
because that that's why I've always been
uncomfortable with it. Like why isn't
 
uncomfortable with it. Like why isn't
this getting freaking better? Why is
 
this getting freaking better? Why is
this so hard? It's because everyone's
 
this so hard? It's because everyone's
kind of hanging out in theoretical land.
 
kind of hanging out in theoretical land.
Yeah. Hanging out in theoretical land
 
Yeah. Hanging out in theoretical land
and in PowerPoint land and in kind of
 
and in PowerPoint land and in kind of
corporate university land. Yeah. Lots of
 
corporate university land. Yeah. Lots of
triangles, lots of models.
 
triangles, lots of models.
Yeah. And look at look at how other
 
Yeah. And look at look at how other
aspects of your life have changed. Right
 
aspects of your life have changed. Right
now social media is about short quick
 
now social media is about short quick
videos. I don't watch anything over 45
 
videos. I don't watch anything over 45
seconds long. Think about how impatient
 
seconds long. Think about how impatient
you are if you go back to watching
 
you are if you go back to watching
regular TV and it comes time for the
 
regular TV and it comes time for the
adverts. I think part of the challenge
 
adverts. I think part of the challenge
with the field of learning and
 
with the field of learning and
development traditionally has been that
 
development traditionally has been that
it has forgotten that it needs to meet
 
it has forgotten that it needs to meet
people where they are. And at times it
 
people where they are. And at times it
can be well we're putting out these
 
can be well we're putting out these
programs and people aren't engaging with
 
programs and people aren't engaging with
them. And these programs are these big
 
them. And these programs are these big
huge vehicles that cost a lot of money
 
huge vehicles that cost a lot of money
that take take people away from their
 
that take take people away from their
actual core work where they are creating
 
actual core work where they are creating
value. To go back to that language and
 
value. To go back to that language and
instead we've got to meet people where
 
instead we've got to meet people where
they are and try and find ways to
 
they are and try and find ways to
compete with the eyeballs. Like people
 
compete with the eyeballs. Like people
will sit in meetings, right? They're
 
will sit in meetings, right? They're
paying attention in the meeting. They're
 
paying attention in the meeting. They're
on their laptop and they're getting
 
on their laptop and they're getting
dinged on their phone. How do we compete
 
dinged on their phone. How do we compete
within that sphere? Right? So maybe that
 
within that sphere? Right? So maybe that
is a podcast while people drive to work.
 
is a podcast while people drive to work.
That's how I do a lot of learning,
 
That's how I do a lot of learning,
listening to the likes of you and
 
listening to the likes of you and
others. Talking to other people in my
 
others. Talking to other people in my
field, right? Learning can take many
 
field, right? Learning can take many
forms. And I think unfortunately the
 
forms. And I think unfortunately the
learning and development infrastructure
 
learning and development infrastructure
that exists out there can be very
 
that exists out there can be very
oriented towards the the big playbooks
 
oriented towards the the big playbooks
that made sense in the earlier part of
 
that made sense in the earlier part of
my career. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost like
 
my career. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost like
I was thinking about this like before we
 
I was thinking about this like before we
started. L &amp; D needs to be like a
 
started. L &amp; D needs to be like a
product, right? You got to think about
 
product, right? You got to think about
it as a product for people in the
 
it as a product for people in the
company that helps them remove friction
 
company that helps them remove friction
and yeah, remove friction and remove
 
and yeah, remove friction and remove
stress, right? And they have to be
 
stress, right? And they have to be
motivated to do that. So if I was
 
motivated to do that. So if I was
interviewing person, I would be like,
 
interviewing person, I would be like,
listen, what are the jobs to be done
 
listen, what are the jobs to be done
with these people? Right? Just like you
 
with these people? Right? Just like you
said, what are the jobs to be done with
 
said, what are the jobs to be done with
our leaders here? and how do we
 
our leaders here? and how do we
productize our L &amp; D efforts to help
 
productize our L &amp; D efforts to help
that get done in the fair way of the
 
that get done in the fair way of the
jobs they're doing every day, right? So
 
jobs they're doing every day, right? So
they actually care about it and they see
 
they actually care about it and they see
it removing friction. So to take the
 
it removing friction. So to take the
other side though, Kelly, right? Like
 
other side though, Kelly, right? Like
please, how how much of this is the
 
please, how how much of this is the
organization's
 
organization's
responsibility? And this is where I've
 
responsibility? And this is where I've
always struggled is like I find that the
 
always struggled is like I find that the
best people are like Fidel, you're
 
best people are like Fidel, you're
saying like when I drive to work, I'm
 
saying like when I drive to work, I'm
listening to podcast. I do the same
 
listening to podcast. I do the same
thing. Kelly does the same thing, right?
 
thing. Kelly does the same thing, right?
I'm not expecting to show up to my
 
I'm not expecting to show up to my
company and be like, "Okay, company, you
 
company and be like, "Okay, company, you
know, what L &amp; D do you have for me,
 
know, what L &amp; D do you have for me,
right? Like, put me through your
 
right? Like, put me through your
curriculum." So, I I struggle with this
 
curriculum." So, I I struggle with this
because I'm like, so let me just I'll
 
because I'm like, so let me just I'll
I'll start with my my thesis on this. My
 
I'll start with my my thesis on this. My
current thesis on what I think L &amp; D
 
current thesis on what I think L &amp; D
should be is we optimize for the top,
 
should be is we optimize for the top,
call it 3 to 5% in the company and
 
call it 3 to 5% in the company and
that's it. And we go person by person.
 
that's it. And we go person by person.
So it's not this like you know
 
So it's not this like you know
overarching big thing but we go person
 
overarching big thing but we go person
by person and we say okay this is what
 
by person and we say okay this is what
we see from you right now. These are the
 
we see from you right now. These are the
gaps that you currently have and we're
 
gaps that you currently have and we're
going to design a bespoke solution to
 
going to design a bespoke solution to
help you fill those gaps. In some cases
 
help you fill those gaps. In some cases
it might be coaching. In some cases it
 
it might be coaching. In some cases it
might be expanding that person's
 
might be expanding that person's
network. In some cases it might be like
 
network. In some cases it might be like
very specific hard skills that we need
 
very specific hard skills that we need
to go get them. That's what I've been
 
to go get them. That's what I've been
thinking because if you if you optimize
 
thinking because if you if you optimize
for those people then a rising tide like
 
for those people then a rising tide like
lifts all boats, right? they're going to
 
lifts all boats, right? they're going to
bring everyone else along with them.
 
bring everyone else along with them.
Fidel, what's your take on that? And
 
Fidel, what's your take on that? And
then also then how are you thinking
 
then also then how are you thinking
about operationalizing at a couch base?
 
about operationalizing at a couch base?
Yeah, look, I agree with you, Nolan. So
 
Yeah, look, I agree with you, Nolan. So
that's really my philosophy as to why I
 
that's really my philosophy as to why I
go after leaders, right? And and by
 
go after leaders, right? And and by
leaders, I do mean all people leaders,
 
leaders, I do mean all people leaders,
but then within the 200 or so people
 
but then within the 200 or so people
leaders that we have, there are 60 that
 
leaders that we have, there are 60 that
are our senior leadership team. And in
 
are our senior leadership team. And in
terms of the cost of the training
 
terms of the cost of the training
interventions for them versus others,
 
interventions for them versus others,
yeah, it's weighted towards them. And so
 
yeah, it's weighted towards them. And so
if you are part of our senior leadership
 
if you are part of our senior leadership
team, you're probably doing coaching,
 
team, you're probably doing coaching,
particularly if you've been here a while
 
particularly if you've been here a while
or if we consider you to be a strong
 
or if we consider you to be a strong
talent. And in that coaching, then it's
 
talent. And in that coaching, then it's
much more personalized and tailored to
 
much more personalized and tailored to
you. It is of course grounded in our
 
you. It is of course grounded in our
leadership capabilities, but we leave it
 
leadership capabilities, but we leave it
to you and to the executive that you
 
to you and to the executive that you
report into as to what you're going to
 
report into as to what you're going to
focus on. That said, I want to make sure
 
focus on. That said, I want to make sure
that there are learning and development
 
that there are learning and development
offerings for everybody in the
 
offerings for everybody in the
organization. So, you might be a new
 
organization. So, you might be a new
manager. Great. We've got a program for

you. You might be under reppresented
 
you. You might be under reppresented
talent and we work with a third party to

I think really that concept of figuring
 
I think really that concept of figuring
out where you can have the most impact
 
out where you can have the most impact
and then over rotating your resources
 
and then over rotating your resources
towards those I think that is the way
 
towards those I think that is the way
forward because very often in learning
 
forward because very often in learning
and development the dialogue has always
 
and development the dialogue has always
been about how do I quantify this right

how do I actually and and I can remember

because really if you're taking somebody
 
because really if you're taking somebody
out of what they're doing what they're
 
out of what they're doing what they're
trying to achieve is that when they then

You mentioned engagement as like one of
 
You mentioned engagement as like one of
the the vectors of of how you think
 
the the vectors of of how you think
about it. So like how does that work? I
 
about it. So like how does that work? I
I'm also very skeptical on engagements
 
I'm also very skeptical on engagements
and I think it sometimes like is like
 
and I think it sometimes like is like
the tail wagging the dog because
 
the tail wagging the dog because
oftentimes we send out these engagement
 
oftentimes we send out these engagement
surveys and we don't do with them
 
surveys and we don't do with them
other than just like look at them and
 
other than just like look at them and
then you know it's I don't think the
 
then you know it's I don't think the
employee base should be setting the
 
employee base should be setting the
agenda of the people team. So how do you
 
agenda of the people team. So how do you
kind of like weave those two things
 
kind of like weave those two things
together? So I agree with you somewhat.
 
together? So I agree with you somewhat.
So I am philosophically opposed to
 
So I am philosophically opposed to
surveying if you do not have the time,
 
surveying if you do not have the time,
the money, the people set aside
 
the money, the people set aside
afterwards to do something about it. So
 
afterwards to do something about it. So
I can remember a few companies ago not
 
I can remember a few companies ago not
doing surveying because I knew that we
 
doing surveying because I knew that we
were we were pretty small and I knew
 
were we were pretty small and I knew
that you know the way we ran our
 
that you know the way we ran our
business was such that I needed to just
 
business was such that I needed to just
really focus on talent acquisition and a
 
really focus on talent acquisition and a
few other areas
 
few other areas
and it just I wasn't going to be able to
 
and it just I wasn't going to be able to
clear the decks to focus on what came
 
clear the decks to focus on what came
out of it. In my current company and in
 
out of it. In my current company and in
my last company, I've been very clear
 
my last company, I've been very clear
with people that we're only running this
 
with people that we're only running this
survey if we're actually going to do
 
survey if we're actually going to do
something with the outcomes. I
 
something with the outcomes. I
personally have stepped away from the
 
personally have stepped away from the
surveys that give you a badge for your
 
surveys that give you a badge for your
website. I think that that's fine if
 
website. I think that that's fine if
that's what you're interested in, but
 
that's what you're interested in, but
what I'm more interested in is the
 
what I'm more interested in is the
survey that gives me the rich data of
 
survey that gives me the rich data of
the goss. So, here at Couchbase, we run
 
the goss. So, here at Couchbase, we run
annual surveys. We did do a midyear
 
annual surveys. We did do a midyear
check-in and then we realized it wasn't
 
check-in and then we realized it wasn't
enough time because we're so focused on
 
enough time because we're so focused on
the actions. But in going into any of
 
the actions. But in going into any of
those surveys, we just closed one last
 
those surveys, we just closed one last
month. It's more so about the actions.
 
month. It's more so about the actions.
Like even the even the language that we
 
Like even the even the language that we
use subtly in our comms is less so about
 
use subtly in our comms is less so about
the survey and it's more about the
 
the survey and it's more about the
actions. It's more of a case of we are
 
actions. It's more of a case of we are
defining what we are going to focus on
 
defining what we are going to focus on
and we need your say rather than like
 
and we need your say rather than like
the survey if that makes sense. When we
 
the survey if that makes sense. When we
then get our survey outcomes, we define
 
then get our survey outcomes, we define
actions at three levels. There's the
 
actions at three levels. There's the
company actions which is what our CEO
 
company actions which is what our CEO
Matt and I are really focused on. So
 
Matt and I are really focused on. So
that might be systems and processes to
 
that might be systems and processes to
use an example from before, right? So
 
use an example from before, right? So
people are telling us there's big
 
people are telling us there's big
problems in that area. Great, we can go
 
problems in that area. Great, we can go
tackle that. Then there are the
 
tackle that. Then there are the
functional level outcomes. So
 
functional level outcomes. So
engineering, what are the things that we
 
engineering, what are the things that we
need to celebrate in engineering and
 
need to celebrate in engineering and
what are the things we need to go after?
 
what are the things we need to go after?
And then there's the manager level. So
 
And then there's the manager level. So
every manager who has I think it's five
 
every manager who has I think it's five
or more responses within their team,
 
or more responses within their team,
they can see some outcomes. Every
 
they can see some outcomes. Every
manager is expected to do one action, do
 
manager is expected to do one action, do
one thing. We don't make it into a big
 
one thing. We don't make it into a big
administrative overhead of telling us
 
administrative overhead of telling us
what that is, but you're constantly
 
what that is, but you're constantly
being told that this is the expectation.
 
being told that this is the expectation.
So, we've got those three levels. We've
 
So, we've got those three levels. We've
got the company level things, we've got
 
got the company level things, we've got
the functional level, and then we've got
 
the functional level, and then we've got
things at the managerial level. That
 
things at the managerial level. That
then becomes the structure when I'm
 
then becomes the structure when I'm
presenting the results, which I did a
 
presenting the results, which I did a
few weeks ago. I spent more time on
 
few weeks ago. I spent more time on
that. Right? Here's what we did at a
 
that. Right? Here's what we did at a
company level since the last time.
 
company level since the last time.
Here's what we're going to do going
 
Here's what we're going to do going
forward. Here's an example of some
 
forward. Here's an example of some
functional stuff. I spent more time on
 
functional stuff. I spent more time on
that than I did on the actual numbers,
 
that than I did on the actual numbers,
if that makes sense. The numbers are
 
if that makes sense. The numbers are
very helpful, right? But it's more so
 
very helpful, right? But it's more so
about the actions that then drives the
 
about the actions that then drives the
strategy for my own people and workplace
 
strategy for my own people and workplace
team. And on a quarterly basis, we have
 
team. And on a quarterly basis, we have
an equivalent of a QBR. We call it an
 
an equivalent of a QBR. We call it an
observ meeting with the rest of the
 
observ meeting with the rest of the
executive team. And I will literally
 
executive team. And I will literally
give an update on projects that we're
 
give an update on projects that we're
doing across all of those and some other
 
doing across all of those and some other
stuff as well. And so it becomes part of
 
stuff as well. And so it becomes part of
the narrative of the organization and at
 
the narrative of the organization and at
our quarterly all hands whenever I'm
 
our quarterly all hands whenever I'm
presenting I will put that work in
 
presenting I will put that work in
context of the company outcomes as well.
 
context of the company outcomes as well.
So the surveys have been really
 
So the surveys have been really
actionoriented for us. If I go back to
 
actionoriented for us. If I go back to
the learning and development topic, one
 
the learning and development topic, one
of the things that was very helpful to
 
of the things that was very helpful to
us the first time we did one of these
 
us the first time we did one of these
surveys after I joined was in getting
 
surveys after I joined was in getting
after that definition of leadership. So
 
after that definition of leadership. So
we had leaders for example who lead
 
we had leaders for example who lead
couch base very very well and lead
 
couch base very very well and lead
themselves very well right they're super
 
themselves very well right they're super
articulate they know the product they're
 
articulate they know the product they're
doing really good things when it came to
 
doing really good things when it came to
the engagement outcomes as it pertain to
 
the engagement outcomes as it pertain to
lead the team less good so the questions
 
lead the team less good so the questions
are things like my manager keeps me
 
are things like my manager keeps me
informed my manager gives me regular
 
informed my manager gives me regular
feedback and so forth and it was really
 
feedback and so forth and it was really
interesting to see these people who we
 
interesting to see these people who we
would have thought would be strong
 
would have thought would be strong
across the board actually have you So
 
across the board actually have you So
green, maybe a little amber, maybe a
 
green, maybe a little amber, maybe a
little red, green, you know, as you
 
little red, green, you know, as you
think about the entire breath of
 
think about the entire breath of
leadership. And so that was very very
 
leadership. And so that was very very
helpful for us. And then hey, that's a
 
helpful for us. And then hey, that's a
that's an easy intervention for a good
 
that's an easy intervention for a good
learning and development team. Go talk
 
learning and development team. Go talk
to that person, acknowledge with them
 
to that person, acknowledge with them
that they might be disappointed in what
 
that they might be disappointed in what
those outcomes are, but it's okay and
 
those outcomes are, but it's okay and
we're here to help you, and here's how
 
we're here to help you, and here's how
we are going to help you. So for me
 
we are going to help you. So for me
there is a real connection between that
 
there is a real connection between that
data that I get from engagement and how
 
data that I get from engagement and how
I can tie it back into evaluating our
 
I can tie it back into evaluating our
proficiency with defining and delivering
 
proficiency with defining and delivering
quality leaders in the organization.
 
quality leaders in the organization.
What happens when there's
 
What happens when there's
disagreement between the narrative of
 
disagreement between the narrative of
the engagement survey and the top-down
 
the engagement survey and the top-down
initiatives from the CEO? That's
 
initiatives from the CEO? That's
interesting. I'm not sure that that has
 
interesting. I'm not sure that that has
been Do you have an example on that,
 
been Do you have an example on that,
Nolan? Like what do you Yeah, an example
 
Nolan? Like what do you Yeah, an example
would be
 
would be
like I think right now like everyone's
 
like I think right now like everyone's
talking about
 
talking about
intensity burnout, like we're too
 
intensity burnout, like we're too
hardcore, like that. Like every
 
hardcore, like that. Like every
early stage company I'm talking to right
 
early stage company I'm talking to right
now is doing some version of 996, right?
 
now is doing some version of 996, right?
 
Again, I think it's stupid, but like
 
Again, I think it's stupid, but like
that is the tech world that we're
 
that is the tech world that we're
currently in. And so I think there's a
 
currently in. And so I think there's a
lot of this sentiment from employees
 
lot of this sentiment from employees
that's like this is too much or like I'm
 
that's like this is too much or like I'm
burnt out or I'm tired or there's a lot
 
burnt out or I'm tired or there's a lot
of like fatigue in the org which I
 
of like fatigue in the org which I
actually don't know if it's much if it's
 
actually don't know if it's much if it's
org driven or if it's more personal. I I
 
org driven or if it's more personal. I I
think there's a lot to discuss there
 
think there's a lot to discuss there
which is with society today but then
 
which is with society today but then
like maybe the CEO is like I actually
 
like maybe the CEO is like I actually
don't think we're intense enough.
 
don't think we're intense enough.
Yeah. I'll give you an example. So that
 
Yeah. I'll give you an example. So that
particular example hasn't been relevant
 
particular example hasn't been relevant
to us. But one thing that has shown up
 
to us. But one thing that has shown up
for us is employees wanting to know more
 
for us is employees wanting to know more
and more and more about company
 
and more and more about company
strategy, our messaging, which we
 
strategy, our messaging, which we
revised a few months ago, our
 
revised a few months ago, our
positioning in the competitive
 
positioning in the competitive
landscape, what all of that looks
 
landscape, what all of that looks
like. And there have definitely been
 
like. And there have definitely been
moments where I've thought, but hang on,
 
moments where I've thought, but hang on,
like we just had kickoff, right? We do a
 
like we just had kickoff, right? We do a
sales kickoff. We just had kickoff for
 
sales kickoff. We just had kickoff for
the whole company. And I think as HR
 
the whole company. And I think as HR
leaders and and as learning and
 
leaders and and as learning and
development leaders, I think we can
 
development leaders, I think we can
often be guilty of but we told them and
 
often be guilty of but we told them and
we told them and we told them again like
 
we told them and we told them again like
we did all of that. But actually, if you
 
we did all of that. But actually, if you
take a step back, no, it's incumbent
 
take a step back, no, it's incumbent
upon me to deliver that message
 
upon me to deliver that message
differently because it's clearly not
 
differently because it's clearly not
reaching everybody in the way they need
 
reaching everybody in the way they need
it all of the time. So maybe I'm pushing
 
it all of the time. So maybe I'm pushing
all of that information out in the
 
all of that information out in the
quarterly all hands, but hey, maybe
 
quarterly all hands, but hey, maybe
somebody can just never join that
 
somebody can just never join that
because of their time zone. So maybe
 
because of their time zone. So maybe
I've got to find ways to share some
 
I've got to find ways to share some
byite-size content on Slack. That's all
 
byite-size content on Slack. That's all
part of learning and development. And
 
part of learning and development. And
that content can help to bridge some of
 
that content can help to bridge some of
that gap. Just today we were talking
 
that gap. Just today we were talking
about how we can leverage that senior
 
about how we can leverage that senior
leadership team, that top 60 leaders in
 
leadership team, that top 60 leaders in
the organization and get them to
 
the organization and get them to
disseminate more of this information on
 
disseminate more of this information on
that particular topic, right? Rather
 
that particular topic, right? Rather
than it always seeming to be something
 
than it always seeming to be something
that Matt needs to do or that other
 
that Matt needs to do or that other
executives need to do. And so I think if
 
executives need to do. And so I think if
you are doing L &amp; D well, when you get
 
you are doing L &amp; D well, when you get
something like that that feels at odds
 
something like that that feels at odds
with what you think you've put out
 
with what you think you've put out
there, you actually need to reframe the
 
there, you actually need to reframe the
problem as how can I do this
 
problem as how can I do this
differently? What can I go and do? I had
 
differently? What can I go and do? I had
a leader say to me in January like this
 
a leader say to me in January like this
just there's no interview training. My
 
just there's no interview training. My
guys don't know how to interview. And I
 
guys don't know how to interview. And I
was like that training that we lost that
 
was like that training that we lost that
we launched about three months ago and
 
we launched about three months ago and
many of them have participated in that.
 
many of them have participated in that.
You just haven't seen it. This is a busy
 
You just haven't seen it. This is a busy
sales leader. Yes, we had put it out in
 
sales leader. Yes, we had put it out in
every Slack message. We had even put it
 
every Slack message. We had even put it
directly on some people's calendars and
 
directly on some people's calendars and
before we made it mandatory for all
 
before we made it mandatory for all
interviewers, we were doing a kind of
 
interviewers, we were doing a kind of
free-for-all. He just hadn't seen it.
 
free-for-all. He just hadn't seen it.
He's just super busy, right? So, fine,
 
He's just super busy, right? So, fine,
right? I'm not going to argue with him
 
right? I'm not going to argue with him
that he missed it, that yes, we already
 
that he missed it, that yes, we already
have it. The better answer, the more
 
have it. The better answer, the more
kind of business partnering oriented
 
kind of business partnering oriented
answer is, yeah, we have that. It's
 
answer is, yeah, we have that. It's
ready to go. How would you like us to
 
ready to go. How would you like us to
deliver that to your team? Do you want
 
deliver that to your team? Do you want
to break them up into small groups? We
 
to break them up into small groups? We
can get them together. Do you want them
 
can get them together. Do you want them
to join the open sessions? That's how
 
to join the open sessions? That's how
you actually meet people where they are.
 
you actually meet people where they are.
Yeah, I like all of that. I really do
 
Yeah, I like all of that. I really do
because that's how I think about it.
 
because that's how I think about it.
Engagement, survey, actions,
 
Engagement, survey, actions,
communications, L &amp; D. I was just
 
communications, L &amp; D. I was just
talking to someone about this. Trying to
 
talking to someone about this. Trying to
make it and weave it in as much as you
 
make it and weave it in as much as you
can to the fairway of the job and the
 
can to the fairway of the job and the
dayto-day. It just works. And I think
 
dayto-day. It just works. And I think
that's the problem with I think the
 
that's the problem with I think the
semantic of L &amp; D. We should probably
 
semantic of L &amp; D. We should probably
call it something different because when
 
call it something different because when
you think of L &amp; D, you think about
 
you think of L &amp; D, you think about
something extra. Taking them off the
 
something extra. Taking them off the
line, taking them out of the job, paying
 
line, taking them out of the job, paying
a bunch of money, listening to a
 
a bunch of money, listening to a
facilitator from a fancy consulting
 
facilitator from a fancy consulting
group. Like that's how it's always been.
 
group. Like that's how it's always been.
And that's really not what it is. Like I
 
And that's really not what it is. Like I
told someone at Quizlet, I'm like,
 
told someone at Quizlet, I'm like,
"Guess what? L &amp; D is going to be the
 
"Guess what? L &amp; D is going to be the
fair way of the job. We are going to
 
fair way of the job. We are going to
leverage leaders teaching leaders
 
leverage leaders teaching leaders
because no one listens to HR. We're
 
because no one listens to HR. We're
going to help the best like we are going
 
going to help the best like we are going
to make this a part of the gig where you
 
to make this a part of the gig where you
don't feel like you're going to traffic
 
don't feel like you're going to traffic
school on a Saturday, you know, and it
 
school on a Saturday, you know, and it
just works. It's worked really well. And
 
just works. It's worked really well. And
they're all like, "Yeah, nodding." And
 
they're all like, "Yeah, nodding." And
again, back to it being a product, it
 
again, back to it being a product, it
helps them remove friction to get their
 
helps them remove friction to get their
jobs done better. Yeah, you you nailed
 
jobs done better. Yeah, you you nailed
the leaders teaching leaders thing,
 
the leaders teaching leaders thing,
Kelly. So, we've heard that twice on the
 
Kelly. So, we've heard that twice on the
show. So one's from Brian Power and then
 
show. So one's from Brian Power and then
the other one from Valentina Gon. And in
 
the other one from Valentina Gon. And in
both of those cases, the thing I took
 
both of those cases, the thing I took
away was like yeah, like I actually
 
away was like yeah, like I actually
think leaders teaching other leaders is
 
think leaders teaching other leaders is
the best way for it to sit in. And like
 
the best way for it to sit in. And like
I would listen to that versus like you
 
I would listen to that versus like you
know HR shows up and I'm like like you
 
know HR shows up and I'm like like you
know everyone's eyes like immediately
 
know everyone's eyes like immediately
roll like all right well they're
 
roll like all right well they're
operating on HR island and everyone else
 
operating on HR island and everyone else
like is actually like trying to drive
 
like is actually like trying to drive
revenue for the business. So Fella how
 
revenue for the business. So Fella how
do you guys think about like do you
 
do you guys think about like do you
engage your leaders to teach?
 
engage your leaders to teach?
Absolutely. So we get that senior
 
Absolutely. So we get that senior
leadership team together on a quarterly
 
leadership team together on a quarterly
basis and of course I usually have
 
basis and of course I usually have
something to say and of course we have
 
something to say and of course we have
our CEO kick it off but I'm thinking of
 
our CEO kick it off but I'm thinking of
a recent example where one of the team
 
a recent example where one of the team
actually raised his hand to say I want
 
actually raised his hand to say I want
to do something around people taking
 
to do something around people taking
accountability right and I want to talk
 
accountability right and I want to talk
to my peers about how we can drive some
 
to my peers about how we can drive some
more of that so he came in and he
 
more of that so he came in and he
presented on that topic got some input
 
presented on that topic got some input
from the group and now he's actually
 
from the group and now he's actually
working on something that we will use in
 
working on something that we will use in
a learning and development capacity with
 
a learning and development capacity with
my team. So yes, I find that very very
 
my team. So yes, I find that very very
valuable. At our sales
 
valuable. At our sales
kickoff, I brought up on stage four
 
kickoff, I brought up on stage four
employees who have had great career
 
employees who have had great career
development, right? Lateral as well as
 
development, right? Lateral as well as
moving up the ladder here at Couchbase
 
moving up the ladder here at Couchbase
and people really valued hearing their
 
and people really valued hearing their
perspectives. They could have listened
 
perspectives. They could have listened
to me for 45 minutes, right? talking at
 
to me for 45 minutes, right? talking at
them about career development and what
 
them about career development and what
they need to do, but actually listening
 
they need to do, but actually listening
to those people that you respect, those
 
to those people that you respect, those
people that you know, those people that
 
people that you know, those people that
you had a drink with the night before.
 
you had a drink with the night before.
That's where I think people took a lot
 
That's where I think people took a lot
of value. So, as much as possible, like
 
of value. So, as much as possible, like
take yourself out of it. I think that
 
take yourself out of it. I think that
that is very very true. Yeah, that makes
 
that is very very true. Yeah, that makes
a ton of sense. You had mentioned
 
a ton of sense. You had mentioned
coaching earlier as well.
 
coaching earlier as well.
So I the coaching kind of similar to
 
So I the coaching kind of similar to
what Kelly's been saying about
 
what Kelly's been saying about
nomenclature. I think for some people
 
nomenclature. I think for some people
they've you know I think for like I'm a
 
they've you know I think for like I'm a
former athlete it's like oh my god like
 
former athlete it's like oh my god like
makes a ton of sense right? Serena
 
makes a ton of sense right? Serena
Williams best tennis player in the world
 
Williams best tennis player in the world
has a coach. Tiger Woods best golfer in
 
has a coach. Tiger Woods best golfer in
the world has a coach. Shouldn't we all
 
the world has a coach. Shouldn't we all
have coaches? But then you kind of get
 
have coaches? But then you kind of get
these like poor examples of it that I
 
these like poor examples of it that I
think dilutes what it should be. So how
 
think dilutes what it should be. So how
do you guys think about coaching? Where
 
do you guys think about coaching? Where
do you deploy it? What does it look
 
do you deploy it? What does it look
like? Yeah. So for us it is those most
 
like? Yeah. So for us it is those most
senior leaders.
 
senior leaders.
So a couple of years ago we started with
 
So a couple of years ago we started with
a subset of them participating in a
 
a subset of them participating in a
leadership program. It's through
 
leadership program. It's through
sounding board.
 
sounding board.
And I think by now we've had maybe 40 of
 
And I think by now we've had maybe 40 of
the 60 if not a little bit more who have
 
the 60 if not a little bit more who have
participated in it. I think we've had
 
participated in it. I think we've had
one or two cases where people have
 
one or two cases where people have
actually changed their coaches, right?
 
actually changed their coaches, right?
Where they have felt, you know what, I
 
Where they have felt, you know what, I
need to get a better fit here. And
 
need to get a better fit here. And
Serena did that. She changed from
 
Serena did that. She changed from
Patrick Moratic. She needed to, right?
 
Patrick Moratic. She needed to, right?
But I think where coaching has helped us
 
But I think where coaching has helped us
is that when I take a step back and I
 
is that when I take a step back and I
look across
 
look across
leaders, it's never really their
 
leaders, it's never really their
technical knowledge. It's never really
 
technical knowledge. It's never really
their experience that holds them back,
 
their experience that holds them back,
but it's maybe their ability to deliver
 
but it's maybe their ability to deliver
a conversation in a certain way. Maybe
 
a conversation in a certain way. Maybe
it's their ability to make it seem like
 
it's their ability to make it seem like
they're not nervous when they're talking
 
they're not nervous when they're talking
to a large group of people, to command
 
to a large group of people, to command
an audience, to have executive presence.
 
an audience, to have executive presence.
It tends to be those intangible, the
 
It tends to be those intangible, the
unmeasurable, immeasurable things. But
 
unmeasurable, immeasurable things. But
that's where coaching has really helped
 
that's where coaching has really helped
with us is, you know, we've encouraged
 
with us is, you know, we've encouraged
them to really go after those aspects,
 
them to really go after those aspects,
the things that they find particularly
 
the things that they find particularly
hard, the things that they get feedback
 
hard, the things that they get feedback
on. So, of course, like a lot of
 
on. So, of course, like a lot of
coaching platforms, there's a survey
 
coaching platforms, there's a survey
beforehand, right? How good is the
 
beforehand, right? How good is the
people at all of these things? And our
 
people at all of these things? And our
leadership capabilities are in there,
 
leadership capabilities are in there,
but also a bunch of other very specific
 
but also a bunch of other very specific
things. And then they go forth with
 
things. And then they go forth with
their coach. We've had a number of
 
their coach. We've had a number of
examples of people wanting to continue
 
examples of people wanting to continue
with their coach and in many cases we've
 
with their coach and in many cases we've
been able to facilitate that. We also
 
been able to facilitate that. We also
then have another program through torch
 
then have another program through torch
which is targeted at underrepresented
 
which is targeted at underrepresented
talent. Now everybody can apply but we
 
talent. Now everybody can apply but we
particularly encourage talent of any
 
particularly encourage talent of any
level who identifies as
 
level who identifies as
underrepresented. And so again this
 
underrepresented. And so again this
might be good for you if you want to
 
might be good for you if you want to
actually have some one-on-one time with
 
actually have some one-on-one time with
a coach. In that particular piece you
 
a coach. In that particular piece you
also meet with your group. So you go
 
also meet with your group. So you go
through it as a cohort. You might have a
 
through it as a cohort. You might have a
session
 
session
on I don't know confidence while
 
on I don't know confidence while
presenting to an executive team led by
 
presenting to an executive team led by
one of their coaches. Bit of Q&amp;A my team
 
one of their coaches. Bit of Q&amp;A my team
are there. Then you go off and you do
 
are there. Then you go off and you do
some work with your coach. Then you come
 
some work with your coach. Then you come
back a few months later there's another
 
back a few months later there's another
one of those meetings and so on and so
 
one of those meetings and so on and so
forth. And throughout all of that
 
forth. And throughout all of that
journey you're meeting with different
 
journey you're meeting with different
members of the executive team as well.
 
members of the executive team as well.
And so it's worked well for us with that
 
And so it's worked well for us with that
population as well because, you know,
 
population as well because, you know,
this one-sizefits-all approach, it's
 
this one-sizefits-all approach, it's
just not really the answer. It's not the
 
just not really the answer. It's not the
modern answer anymore. You know, we all
 
modern answer anymore. You know, we all
want to have diverse workforces in every
 
want to have diverse workforces in every
single way. Well, we all learn
 
single way. Well, we all learn
differently, right? We all consume
 
differently, right? We all consume
information differently. We all just
 
information differently. We all just
have different needs and different
 
have different needs and different
energy levels. And so that's really what
 
energy levels. And so that's really what
we've been able to find with coaching is
 
we've been able to find with coaching is
that it can deliver that personalized
 
that it can deliver that personalized
piece and then I can correlate
 
piece and then I can correlate
engagement outcomes with did this person
 
engagement outcomes with did this person
attend did this person attend any of our
 
attend did this person attend any of our
leadership programming. Obviously it's
 
leadership programming. Obviously it's
all anonymized within culture but in the
 
all anonymized within culture but in the
same way as it tracks what region you're
 
same way as it tracks what region you're
in. It tracks at a highest level for me
 
in. It tracks at a highest level for me
at a very high level. Here are the
 
at a very high level. Here are the
outcomes for leaders who've participated
 
outcomes for leaders who've participated
in programs and the ones who haven't. So
 
in programs and the ones who haven't. So
Delma, my last question for you is
 
Delma, my last question for you is
really what do you think this means for
 
really what do you think this means for
L &amp; D talent going forward, right? I
 
L &amp; D talent going forward, right? I
mean, do you see the role changing, the
 
mean, do you see the role changing, the
title changing? Do you interview
 
title changing? Do you interview
differently now when you start hiring L
 
differently now when you start hiring L
&amp; D folks? Where do you think it's
 
&amp; D folks? Where do you think it's
going? Well, I'll actually take a bit of
 
going? Well, I'll actually take a bit of
a detour into the past. So when I
 
a detour into the past. So when I
started my career in consulting, it was
 
started my career in consulting, it was
learning and development attached to
 
learning and development attached to
systems implementations, right? So, it
 
systems implementations, right? So, it
was about the change curve and we would
 
was about the change curve and we would
have all of these spreadsheets of these
 
have all of these spreadsheets of these
different groups of people and where
 
different groups of people and where
might they be on the change curve, where
 
might they be on the change curve, where
did we need to get them to, what level
 
did we need to get them to, what level
of knowledge would they have? Then we
 
of knowledge would they have? Then we
would go and create all of these massive
 
would go and create all of these massive
PowerPoint decks, take them away from
 
PowerPoint decks, take them away from
their day job, and then expect them to
 
their day job, and then expect them to
absorb all of this change and behave
 
absorb all of this change and behave
differently. And even in my own
 
differently. And even in my own
training, like we were flown to Chicago
 
training, like we were flown to Chicago
for two weeks at a time to do like super
 
for two weeks at a time to do like super
intense training and and then back to
 
intense training and and then back to
the day job it was, you know, your head
 
the day job it was, you know, your head
is still spinning. So that was kind of
 
is still spinning. So that was kind of
the way learning and development used to
 
the way learning and development used to
be. And then there became this big
 
be. And then there became this big
movement around hiring instructional
 
movement around hiring instructional
designers, right? And it all being
 
designers, right? And it all being
really about the design and the look and
 
really about the design and the look and
feel and that that was very important.
 
feel and that that was very important.
And then there became this big movement
 
And then there became this big movement
around strengths and I think it got a
 
around strengths and I think it got a
little bit overrotated to that right
 
little bit overrotated to that right
because most of the time we're trying to
 
because most of the time we're trying to
develop people on their areas of
 
develop people on their areas of
opportunity. Then we kind of segueed
 
opportunity. Then we kind of segueed
into skills and skills were the big
 
into skills and skills were the big
thing in learning and development a few
 
thing in learning and development a few
years ago. But work isn't organized
 
years ago. But work isn't organized
around skills, right? It's organized
 
around skills, right? It's organized
around groups of related tasks that need
 
around groups of related tasks that need
to get done, right? So that's how
 
to get done, right? So that's how
obviously there are there you're
 
obviously there are there you're
obviously learning skills all of the
 
obviously learning skills all of the
time and developing people's skills, but
 
time and developing people's skills, but
it just didn't necessarily tally with
 
it just didn't necessarily tally with
the way people were structuring their
 
the way people were structuring their
work. But I do remember one particular
 
work. But I do remember one particular
movement in learning and development in
 
movement in learning and development in
leadership content about maybe five,
 
leadership content about maybe five,
six, seven years ago. It was all around
 
six, seven years ago. It was all around
VUO, this volatile, uncertain world that
 
VUO, this volatile, uncertain world that
we were now living in. And I remember
 
we were now living in. And I remember
that being a dominant topic throughout
 
that being a dominant topic throughout
all of the leadership material that most
 
all of the leadership material that most
organizations were putting out there.
 
organizations were putting out there.
And then came resilience as well. And I
 
And then came resilience as well. And I
actually think that for the most part
 
actually think that for the most part
the learning and development function
 
the learning and development function
got that right because now when I'm
 
got that right because now when I'm
thinking about a learning and
 
thinking about a learning and
development function well yeah
 
development function well yeah
everything around us is volatile. So our
 
everything around us is volatile. So our
learning and development needs to just
 
learning and development needs to just
be massively agile, right? It needs to
 
be massively agile, right? It needs to
be always learning itself and always
 
be always learning itself and always
thinking of how can I help these people
 
thinking of how can I help these people
to adjust their behavior and create more
 
to adjust their behavior and create more
value while they are so consumed with
 
value while they are so consumed with
doing their role and doing it in a world
 
doing their role and doing it in a world
in which there's increased volatility at
 
in which there's increased volatility at
a macro level and elsewhere and that's
 
a macro level and elsewhere and that's
really testing their skills of
 
really testing their skills of
resilience and everything else. And so
 
resilience and everything else. And so
it's a long way of answering your
 
it's a long way of answering your
question, but for me what am I thinking
 
question, but for me what am I thinking
about when I hire these people? It's do
 
about when I hire these people? It's do
they get that right? Do they want to go
 
they get that right? Do they want to go
away and build PowerPoint decks for a
 
away and build PowerPoint decks for a
few hours at a time or are they thinking
 
few hours at a time or are they thinking
about what are the new tools that are
 
about what are the new tools that are
coming down the line in this space that
 
coming down the line in this space that
can help me to get learning content in
 
can help me to get learning content in
front of people on Slack for example or
 
front of people on Slack for example or
when they log in in the morning a
 
when they log in in the morning a
question of like have you given feedback
 
question of like have you given feedback
today whatever it is those are the
 
today whatever it is those are the
skills that I'm looking for and within
 
skills that I'm looking for and within
our team here you know we have people
 
our team here you know we have people
who have learning and development
 
who have learning and development
diversity equity inclusion and
 
diversity equity inclusion and
engagement ment backgrounds and they're
 
engagement ment backgrounds and they're
all mingled together within the team.
 
all mingled together within the team.
We're going to more formally have them
 
We're going to more formally have them
all start to lean into each other's work
 
all start to lean into each other's work
a little bit because all of those things
 
a little bit because all of those things
to me are just so highly correlated. I
 
to me are just so highly correlated. I
love that. The last one for me, Fidelma,
 
love that. The last one for me, Fidelma,
is actually around getting it wrong. So
 
is actually around getting it wrong. So
like it's it seems like you you are very
 
like it's it seems like you you are very
well put together on the way you're
 
well put together on the way you're
thinking about this. You're engaging the
 
thinking about this. You're engaging the
business, right? We're launching very
 
business, right? We're launching very
quickly. We're not launching perfect
 
quickly. We're not launching perfect
solutions, but I think a lot of people
 
solutions, but I think a lot of people
who have tried this have at at some
 
who have tried this have at at some
point in time been punched in the face
 
point in time been punched in the face
with like that one didn't land. Do you
 
with like that one didn't land. Do you
have an example of that and then how you
 
have an example of that and then how you
learn from it and then how you move
 
learn from it and then how you move
forward? Yeah, I think the toughest area
 
forward? Yeah, I think the toughest area
in all of this is actually meeting
 
in all of this is actually meeting
people where they are in terms of career
 
people where they are in terms of career
development. And that's one that several
 
development. And that's one that several
times over the course of my career I've
 
times over the course of my career I've
felt a bit punched in the face because
 
felt a bit punched in the face because
people will always say in every
 
people will always say in every
interaction that you have whether that's
 
interaction that you have whether that's
a survey or anything else that they want
 
a survey or anything else that they want
more career development. Totally never
 
more career development. Totally never
ending. Two sales kickoffs ago, I stood
 
ending. Two sales kickoffs ago, I stood
on the stage and I said, "Who wants
 
on the stage and I said, "Who wants
career development?" Every hand in the
 
career development?" Every hand in the
room goes up. Okay. Who's done a
 
room goes up. Okay. Who's done a
development plan? A smattering of hands
 
development plan? A smattering of hands
go up, right? And that can actually
 
go up, right? And that can actually
sting. It's like why am I designing all
 
sting. It's like why am I designing all
of these tools, building these tools,
 
of these tools, building these tools,
and putting them out there? So, there
 
and putting them out there? So, there
have been times where, and I I'm going

over the next few months who are heading
 
over the next few months who are heading
into the world of work who will be doing
 
into the world of work who will be doing
very different things to what they
 
very different things to what they
thought they would be doing when they
 
thought they would be doing when they
made those choices. And the same is true
 
made those choices. And the same is true
of tenur professionals as well. So that
 
of tenur professionals as well. So that
is the piece where I have definitely

comp and how you can make more money and
how we think about comp here? Let's do
 
how we think about comp here? Let's do
that." So, I feel like that that whole
