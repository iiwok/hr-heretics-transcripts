all right Nolan hello HR heretic segment
here special segment I had an idea on
this one you know for this week and I
was talking to a few folks last couple
weeks and mentoring some some people and
there's a big topic out there Nolan on
you know a HR functions HR teams not for
better lack of a better word toting
their own horns enough right promotion
within the company standing up holding
up the results and the work they've been
doing they kind of there there's a you
know a feeling out there that we kind of
hang out behind the curtain we get the
work done but we only kind of come out
when stuff goes wrong when we're calling
to fix stuff you know these unpopular
programs and I just want to talk about
the importance of kind of promoting the
work when things are great and it's fun
and how to you know get your your HR
team your people teams out in the
company as a powerful force for good
that is proactive and Lively and like
bright and through my career I haven't
seen this happen a lot and I'd love to
just get your take on it and have a chat
on it yeah it's interesting so I've I've
two takes like one is is like I think
people actually don't know if they're
doing good work I think they think it's
good work but they don't know how it's
like Landing with their peers or with
the broader company and so like my first
take is is like like where are you and
and the first way to figure that out is
like asking for feedback and what's
what's interesting is is like if you ask
for feedback on your work um and truly
like are searching for the truth as
opposed to searching for an answer you
get to really deep clarity quickly you
know like Charlie kers and I at C I
think about this all the time um
Charlie's a very quiet guy yet like when
I would ask for feedback and like
specific feedback of like hey give me
two to three ways this could have been
better he would give them to me right
away and so I knew of like okay I can
make this thing better I can make this
thing Tighter and so when I think about
promotion the other take I have is I
think a lot of people are like doing
mediocre work and thinking it's like
amazing you know if you think about just
like performance reviews and think about
like the distribution curve of
performance reviews the 80% of people
are in like the meets expectations
category yeah and that's true across all
functions like we as HR Pros know that
and so it's no different in the HR
function and I think there's this
like there's this thought that you know
for you my work is great and I think
going back to my first point is unless
you're asking for feedback specifically
from your peers and your manager you
don't know and I would start there right
yeah I I agree and and also I like I'm a
big proponent of the employee base like
a big way you know if if you're making
impact and kind of leading this this
company and this organization of the
employees know who you are and what the
hell you're doing every day and it's
it's amazing how me how how
much how how what the percentage of the
organizations that have no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clue
what HR teams do every day right so like
if you want a litmus test like you walk
around whatever the hallway Zoom what
whatever wherever it is you work now and
you asked like asked 15 employees do you
know what the HR team does here or you
know who who they are like you'll get
feedback real quick
um yeah you know on your work on how
you're perceived on how you're intera
acting and talking to the organization
like and another litmus test I love is
you know even at at every company but
most recently app pendo obviously like
there there is not a town hall like all
company All Hands does not go
by without someone being up there
talking about what we're doing how it's
connecting to the business top and
bottom line where we're going from here
and kind of like with swagger do you
know what I mean not like it's
performance review time like blah blah
blah like what are we doing like we got
some we got some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on here and
it it it promotes a different level of
energy in in the organization that
impacts the culture also and if you
can't do that it's a great litus test
like what if I get to talk
about so help me reconcile you know so I
one of my takes that people do not like
uh is I think engage yeah
just thank you uh I think I think
engagement surveys are complete [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and part of the reason why is is like
the first couple are like really
interesting and then then you just like
you know people start gaming the system
and you know one of the the answers or
one of the questions in engagement
surveys that always rates the lowest is
compensation and it doesn't matter how
well your company compensates yeah I
remember like at Carta we were one of
the few startups at the time that was
doing some sort a 401k match and nobody
thought about it ever like ever yeah and
so I I help me
reconcile this like you know on one hand
you actually are doing interesting
things or maybe like you have data that
shows that you're like we offered a 401k
match and then on the other hand
employees are like well I want more yeah
yeah you guys are full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I will
tell you a story this is this is great
actually this is going to be helpful and
if you only listen to do a part of it
and get bored with me the tldr of the
story is you don't explain the what of
the work you're doing you explain the
bows of the why and how it is
architected because most of the time
when employees are
cynical and they come down in HR or
whatnot it's because they don't
understand how the sausage is made if
you can get up in front of an entire
company and look everyone in the face
knowing that you're not going to make
everyone happy and objectively
defensively explain to everyone how
you're building these things bottom up
it literally solves everything like not
everything but so I was coming back from
Raleigh right from uh those of you who a
pendo remember this it's like an
Infamous AMA like Infamous AMA session
but it's flying back from Raleigh after
an offsite and you know how that goes
after like the late nights and you're
flying back and you're just at the
airport like trying to get home and fly
cross country and every you know two
weeks the amas come in anonymous which
is a whole other topic we should have a
segment on
as um and so seven come in in a row just
boom boom boom boom boom in the channel
and I'm just watching this on like three
hours of sleep so wait hold on so for
your amas everyone can see them oh what
a nightmare everyone can see them so
seven come in in a row clearly from the
same person which is brilliant and
they're all about comp it's basically
like how how is all this stuff decided
created made right and and it was great
I was like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is an
opportunity to literally lift up the
hood and explain every part of this
engine not the car and the color and the
make and the model literally every part
of it and here's the trick in a very
simple way that like a thousand people
can understand and it was probably one
of the best amas we had in Olan and like
it it it it literally lifted the lid on
the whole comp thing so now everyone
knows how we built this engine why we
built it like we built it what is things
like Radford mean and comper ratios and
who decides their pay and how does it
work like extremely raw and extremely
transparent and I just say that because
if I would have run around and said what
do you guys what do you guys want to
hear from us on comp at this company if
we were to talk the next to all hands
like what that is the the the meaningful
work that brins hearts and minds of a
company and brings people along with HR
not just communicating the end policy
and the outcome they don't believe you
they don't trust

here's a crazy stat between hybrid and
Frontline employees about 80% don't
typically work in an office so it's no
surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work via
zoom's employee experience platform
comes in if you've ever recoiled at the
thought of a static internet that looks
like something you built in 1995 using

work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a Dem
and make sure you tell them that Nolan
and Kelly from HR Heretics sent
 
you well okay so I'll pull the thread on
the comp thing because one of my really
good friends is a head of Total Rewards
and his Infamous line is comp is like
 
art how do you explain that to pleas I I
also have really good friends in total
rewards and that was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slide we
put up there we literally said it's it's
a lot of it is Art but you have to
describe what the art is H okay right
it's the human it's the experience it's
not just the data that comes from a
system you can't just say it's art
because then they'll be like you're full
of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you have to expl again to
the point of lifting up the hood and
unpacking you have to explain why it is
Art and examp example of what that might
look like like you literally have to
create a thousand mini HR people and
talk about this in ways that to your
point I don't think a lot of HR people
either can or have tried it because it's
a level of like unpacking that probably
a lot of haven't said out loud before
it's SC that that is a really good point
too uh I'm going to come back so the
first thing though is it's scary I
remember feeling this at CA like Henry
is a a very transparent person and I was
like dude I don't want to like get to
this level of detail on things like it
just feels like borderline like too much
um and I was wrong about that like upon
reflection I think you're exactly right
I think Henry was right like the more
transparent you are even in the areas
that are really uncomfortable right the
the better that people understand and
when they understand they can better
empathize and then on your point I think
the second order is is like
what you're really talking about is
first principles and so if you explain
why we do something that forces you to
think about why we do it and maybe you
won't be happy with the answer and I
think that's like one of the things that
uh HR folks have been resistant to I
think there's some change now given like
what's going on in the macro but why do
we actually do this and if if your
answer is well we've always done it this
way or this is a best practice that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
doesn't fly with people that doesn't
build trust like you have to actually
explain why it makes sense for your
company at this moment in time totally
like I always say like you have to
explain the why of this stuff um and
like we always started with the same
slide we didn't start with like a
program or an update on a specific thing
we started with why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we here
like just remind you like why this
people team is here like what do we do
that impacts the business and that the
the the culture impacts the business so
that's a part of it but the overall is
what are we doing to impact our business
and create more value for our customers
and grow our our our organization so it
was always that like it always came back
down to that then they can connect you
know all the all that all the way down
um the the other thing I'll say on this
Kelly is that like this takes time um
and I remember you know Leading the
People team at Carta and being like
we're drowning or you know we're growing
super fast like we don't have enough
people on the team we're staffed and
then You' get one of these questions
from an employee yes and immediately my
thought was like I have no time for this
PO behind yeah yeah like I'm drowning I
said this I said this to my Pender team
I was like dude when an AMA question
comes in and that kicks off a program
for you like when the employees are
ahead of you that's not good and the
trick the trick the trick for any cheap
people officer is like do not not get
behind the eightball like do not get
sucked into the grind so much that you
can't see the forest of the trees
because those moments will happen and
they'll happen every week and then all
the bad things happen burnout
frustration exhaustion perception of you
not being strategic all this stuff is
connected and then I'll go back to like
the transparency know we talked about
this a bunch with different leaders on
the show like the vulnerability even in
my career early on it was like oh I
can't talk about this and it's perfect
or like I know all the answers and it's
US versus them it's like the HR team
versus 1200 people that are like asking
questions and that's just not true like
you know at pendo we were like listen
guys we don't know all the answers here
trust us here's what's going on the
Cake's Half Baked here's what color and
temp it is here's when it's going to be
done here's how you get involved like
the point is vulnerability and
transparency of process wins a lot of
hearts and it humanizes you it's correct
you know it turns out that uh the
executive team does we don't have
Godlike Powers about where the company
is going like we're we're human too and
we don't know like we're just putting
one foot in front of the other yeah and
I think there's um there's I don't know
where this actually came from but
there's clearly like an expectation of
like they have all the answers and I
think whenever you get to the mode of
like everyone thinks you have all the
answers you have not created the right
Rel relationship totally so the net on
this for me and we can talk about it
more and I love other other feedback
topics from you all is just start start
practicing this stuff out in the open
even if you're not ready um you'll see a
world difference show your
work all right let us know what you guys
think thanks thanks all HR Heretics it's
