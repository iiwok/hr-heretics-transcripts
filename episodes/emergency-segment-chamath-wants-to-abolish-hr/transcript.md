all right what's up everybody it's
Friday March 8th and we have an
emergency segment because we want to
cover what the all-in podcast said last
week about abolishing

HR emergency so first off first off
shout out to Cassie who is like you guys
have to do a segment on this topic she
was right all right let me set the
context so the all-in podcast is the
number one business podcast in the world
it's four guys who have generally been
very successful in Silicon Valley most
of them like CEOs and investors and then
there's Jason which is I always give
hard time for that anyways here's the
context on this segment so where they L
off was with Shawn Maguire and Shawn
Maguire is a partner at sequa Capital
now and he's been having these sub
tweets for a couple of months around his
experience at Google he worked at Google
Ventures and finally last week he came
out and said the thing that he's been
wanting to say publicly for a while this
is his direct tweet which is it's from
his manager at Google who was talking to
him he said I'm not really supposed to
tell you this it could get me fired
you're one of the highest performing
people here but I can't promote you
right now because I have a quota my
hands are tied you'll get the next slot
please be patient I'm really sorry again
that's Shan Maguire who is a now a
partner at squ Capital this is what
caused him to leave Google to join seoa
so Shawn is
insinuating that he should have gotten
promoted but didn't because he's a white
male so this is what spawned the
conversation uh for the all-in Pod last
week and shth poopaa came in and said he
does not have HR at any of his companies
where he is in majority control and he
believes HR should be abolished and so a
lot of the discussion in the Pod was
about out of control Dei unbundling HR
and recruiting into each org and having
the org leader run it and then the HR
person having become like the company
police officer or's David Sax said the
the commas are so Kelly what's your take
well yeah look I think it's easy to get
all fired up about this I had people
text me did you see this and and just
like we do on the show I think we have
to double click into why they're saying
what they're saying because if I think
if I think about that Nolan I actually
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] agree with the why I do I mean
we we we talked about this in a lot of
sessions right the Dei kind of rules
that have came out I'm not surprised at
that stance from Google I've heard it
before myself in diff different ways and
I don't think it's bad intent I think it
is lazy and I think it is reactive uh to
a issue and a challenge and a problem
that's going to take years so I think
it's a very lazy hey here's a rule don't
promote these people to do that that's
just not the right approach it is lazy
and it's a policy to do things that we
should be working hard that take years
minutes time conversations reflection
that's all the hard work right it's like
therapy or not and I think it's a la a
lazy reaction I don't blame him for
leaving so that that's on the Google
piece I'm I'm frankly more interested in
the abolishment of HR I think that's
very interesting um so I was listening
to him and it's it's so funny because
what he was saying
basically he's in my mind what what I
took away is he's saying the leaders
should basically be HR correct like my
objective view is is strip the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
title strip the person if you will or
the box in the org chart
but what I'm saying is that the work of
this function will never go away he's
just giving it and decentralizing it to
Business Leaders who are capable of
doing it and so I just think it's a
little trite to be like we should
abolish HR because it's really not it's
abolishing the function and it's farming
it out and trusting Business Leaders to
do it yeah so I guess like all right so
let me respond and then I want to get
your take on you're right that's exactly
the way he's describing the abolishment
of it so let me just start with like
what I agree with I think this like
superficial marking based off immutable
traits is not healthy like I have
personally been told this hire needs to
be insert racer gender I have heard that
inside of companies and I think that's
been part of the problem and I think
that's that's part of the reason why
you're getting such push back the other
thing I agree with that they were
talking about is HR teams will be a lot
smaller in the future and I think we're
we're going through some of this change
right now I think what they're missing
is is
like you know every HR leader we've had
on the show has said something along the
lines of HR should enable the business
to move faster and perform at a higher
clip and so if you think of the the
metaphor of like if the business is like
a Formula One car HR is like like the
oil that keeps everything lubricated to
go really really fast and you know the
way I think about great HR great
recruiting is we should be
operationalizing the culture yes and you
do this by ensuring that the values and
the performance bar is upheld reinforced
and then consistent across the entire
orc and so what shth is arguing for is
hey let's decentralize this let's
unbundle it and put it into the hands of
basically the exec team and look I've
I've seen this and the problem with this
is it becomes
fums and so then you have you know exec
call it CTO over here and exec Finance
leader over here and they view their
bars entirely differently and then when
their teams try to work together cross
functionally there's a ton of friction
totally versus I do think as it relates
to culture it should be like a top down
this is the way that we are building
this company and you can either sign up
or you can vote with your feet and leave
the other thing I think HR team should
be doing is eliminating bias and I know
what's immediately going to happen is
everyone's going to say like yeah like
you know for the people who listen to
the show is like they're going to think
race and gender and of course I mean
that but I also mean time bias in hiring
every single hiring manager wants to
make a hire as fast as possible because
they have a hole on the team that needs
to be filled and I think time bias and
hiring is the ultimate way to get hires
wrong and so HR and recruiting should be
doing their job of ensuring like oh I
don't know this one meets our bar and
that's actually like where great
conversations are happening in the
hiring process similarly in performance
reviews right you get proximity bias of
like well this I mean this person's been
amazing for me well the finance you know
the CFO told me they suck and so like we
shouldn't be promoting like just
rounding out the gaps and covering blind
spots yeah so what what's your take on
that no no I look I think what shth was
saying I I do agree with they're all T
types of different diversity right there
was example hey if you hire all your
shity sisters or fraternity brothers so
so be it which I think was a very silly
example but shth came back and said
there are all types there are all types
of diversity and I know you know race
and gender is very important and they're
necessary but they're just not
sufficient and yeah I think what he's
saying is we have you know over indexed
on mat only to a point where you have
Google making these crazy rules around
it and they're they're just using those
very wild examples to highlight that
which I agree with race and gender are
necessary not sufficent so I think the
theme for me is it's it's much bigger
than a certain piece of it or what not I
mean I I lose my mind every time and I
hear it still all the time they're not a
diversity candidate like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
are you talking about they're a human
being every human being is diverse but
what are you accenting for what type
like what are you optimizing no one's
not a diversity candidate I mean you
probably got all sorts of things that
are you know we'll go into that lat lot
issues you got a lot of issues you know
um but anyway I I I think that's that's
why we should strive for
representation say saying that and
accenting toward a certain point is is
is dangerous and it's just not
complete hey everyone we'll be right

heretic sent
[Music]
you
now the HR piece I I think again I had
the same reaction you did and I can't
believe I agreed with you is I think it
is and you say this all the time that's
a utopian that's a wonderful dream to be
able to Outsource this and only have
legal firms that are vendors deal with
all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like totally especially the
Growth Company yeah I mean again I got a
rash listening to this because that's a
wonderful idea but if you think you're
going to Outsource hiring or these high
stakes things to all different functions
and you're going to one get get quality
consistency fairness of process and most
importantly above all that policy stuff
consistency in the type of people you're
coming in to match your culture right
that's the glue I'm talking about and
you used oil in a car and I'm using glue
the role of HR whatever you want to call
it I think the title will change at some
point by the way the role of HR isn't
rules policies and legal stuff again
that that is the floor it is is the glue
being the glue in these organizations
and architecting that culture in ways
that are consistent that can scale and
are optimizing the business that is the
role and that's what he's saying that he
wants Business Leaders to do which is
fine but I've yet to see a company where
those leaders can be that glue around
that architecture and that is a skill
set that that I think is very important
and I think it's been minimized in this
conversation it's really interesting
because there's this notion of drri the
directly responsible individual
essentially what shth is arguing for is
that the dri is everybody and in my
experience in business when the drri is
everybody it's
nobody and so or it's like complete
chaos that's what I mean yeah that's
what I mean is like who actually owns
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing yeah either it
doesn't get done or it gets done in like
wildly different ways that are more
disruptive to the business that's what I
that's what I mean is like that's why I
love the Formula 1 car analogy because
like there's so many moving pieces in a
business and if we're going to go as
fast as we possibly can in the same
direction we need to have all of the
pieces together and we need to have the
lubricant to make sure that there isn't
friction and we're not internally
fighting with each other which does
happen in business it happens in
relationships and life so you know my
take is over the last five to 10 years
HR has swung this pendulum really far to
one side of the spectrum and optimize
for things that are not in the best
interest of the business that are
instead in best interest of quotas we've
talked about this in the past but this
is the natural reaction that you're
seeing now from Business Leaders who are
the people that sign the checks saying
like I don't want this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in my
company anymore and if there is HR it's
now thought of as this like
administrative function and like go sit
in the corner and run my
benefits and you know for me it's a sad
State of Affairs that it had to like go
this far to now you're having like again
the most important business podcast the
most listened to business podcast in the
world saying we should abolish HR they
haven't experienced good HR and and this
is this is a call to action to Great HR
leaders to step up in this moment and to
say no no no my job is actually to
enable the business to move faster to
achieve our goals faster and that's
where I think this is ultimately going
to go is quotas are going they're gone
and now it's going to be about how can
we enable the business to move as fast
as it possibly can yep I mean in my
takeaway was let's not throw the baby
out with a bath water like if you've
worked with shitty HR leaders like let's
let's not assume everyone's like that
and find the good ones you know I think
be that person our listeners be that
person be be that per be the change this
is why I think a lot of Business Leaders
CEOs are tapping on Business Leaders to
come into this role which is fine I
don't care what you call it who it is
the work is important and the work needs
to be there or else I think at scale
you're going to be like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what
just happened a funny example I loved
when he said get an external Law Firm
Outsource all that stuff they shouldn't
be knowing the intimate details and I
agree everyone if you don't have like an
oric or a back stop that you can call on
when you're in trouble big mistake if
you're using that as your HR partner for
every little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that comes up
you're out of your mind not only not
only is it yeah can you imagine Dolan
you're looking at the bottom line oh by
the way here's a here's a bill for $10
million at the end of the year someone
looked at someone wrong and you called
oric No and and and I laughed also
because you know they shouldn't be
knowing those intimate details about
things that happened and you have to if
you're the employer and you're going to
make a termination decision based on an
investigation you've outsourced you're
going to be like you're fired and I
don't know really what happened doesn't
no Outsource as much as you can but that
glue and that oil in the company and
this role no matter who it is or what
you call it I think is imperative amen
and just quick shout out to to Jessica
periot oric who is awesome and then Dan
McCoy and Fenwick who are like my two
favorite employment lawyers on the
planet well if we're doing that I'll
shout out Jim McCay out at orc I mean
they're just like the best so but I do
agree us for this or's not pay us for
yeah right okay so so here's here's the
story is like we want your feedback on
this I think this is going to be a a
topic in HR for the remainder of the
year because this is where Business
Leaders are at with their level of
frustration so uh please share this with
your friends please comment like let us
know what your thoughts are Kelly and I
are going to continue to have these
conversations and looking forward to
hearing from you all thanks thanks all
