&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me. I'm
thrilled to be here.
 
thrilled to be here.
&gt;&gt; So, I I want to just start quickly with
 
&gt;&gt; So, I I want to just start quickly with
your background. You're currently a
 
your background. You're currently a
partner at 776.
 
partner at 776.
You were also the head of people at
 
You were also the head of people at
Reddit from like 70 to more than 700.
 
Reddit from like 70 to more than 700.
How did you initially get into people in
 
How did you initially get into people in
HR?
 
HR?
&gt;&gt; Uh that is a good question. So yeah, how
 
&gt;&gt; Uh that is a good question. So yeah, how
did I get into HR? Um was totally an
 
did I get into HR? Um was totally an
accident. A lot of the best folks in our
 
accident. A lot of the best folks in our
industry are people who I think will say
 
industry are people who I think will say
HR found me. It it's almost always HR
 
HR found me. It it's almost always HR
found me. And I think that part of that
 
found me. And I think that part of that
is because the world of HR prior to what
 
is because the world of HR prior to what
 
was so not a destination career. But I I
 
was so not a destination career. But I I
think that most people found it on
 
think that most people found it on
accident because it was they were
 
accident because it was they were
naturally drawn to or they were in an
 
naturally drawn to or they were in an
organization where people were coming to
 
organization where people were coming to
them, people were confiding in them. And
 
them, people were confiding in them. And
so it really was a community role, an
 
so it really was a community role, an
internal community role. So, prior to
 
internal community role. So, prior to
getting into the world of tech and the
 
getting into the world of tech and the
world of HR, I was at Pixar Animation
 
world of HR, I was at Pixar Animation
Studios where I never held an HR
 
Studios where I never held an HR
position. But what I like to say is I
 
position. But what I like to say is I
was a client and a very happy client of
 
was a client and a very happy client of
the HR and people function at Pixar. And
 
the HR and people function at Pixar. And
I really credit that team with teaching
 
I really credit that team with teaching
me so much about what great HR looks
 
me so much about what great HR looks
like. And so when I eventually left the
 
like. And so when I eventually left the
studio and I did move into tech, it was
 
studio and I did move into tech, it was
it was an opportunity to take all of the
 
it was an opportunity to take all of the
incredible things that I had learned
 
incredible things that I had learned
there as a customer to say, gosh, I love
 
there as a customer to say, gosh, I love
the way they built out their learning
 
the way they built out their learning
and development system. Looking at the
 
and development system. Looking at the
Pixar University model, for example,
 
Pixar University model, for example,
they didn't call it learning and
 
they didn't call it learning and
development. It was the Pixar
 
development. It was the Pixar
University. And it's funny because it
 
University. And it's funny because it
was called PU. And the beauty of that
 
was called PU. And the beauty of that
program was they allowed anybody in the
 
program was they allowed anybody in the
studio regardless of your role, your
 
studio regardless of your role, your
title, your tenure, your salary,
 
title, your tenure, your salary,
anything could attend any course. they
 
anything could attend any course. they
they saw that you could develop uh deep
 
they saw that you could develop uh deep
relationships and move the business
 
relationships and move the business
forward and unpack and and discover
 
forward and unpack and and discover
creative ideas that could then be put
 
creative ideas that could then be put
into the film or put into a part of the
 
into the film or put into a part of the
process from all different parts of the
 
process from all different parts of the
organization. And so for me that was not
 
organization. And so for me that was not
we need to have a learning and
 
we need to have a learning and
development uh system. It was how do we
 
development uh system. It was how do we
live the value great ideas come from
 
live the value great ideas come from
anywhere. So, Caitlin, you've been
 
anywhere. So, Caitlin, you've been
working with Alexis O'Hania now for I
 
working with Alexis O'Hania now for I
think about 9 years.
 
think about 9 years.
&gt;&gt; How did you meet Alexis and how has that
 
&gt;&gt; How did you meet Alexis and how has that
relationship evolved over time?
 
relationship evolved over time?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, how I met him was he hired me
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, how I met him was he hired me
at Reddit. So, during the big
 
at Reddit. So, during the big
turnaround, I think that we first met in
 
turnaround, I think that we first met in
 
kept telling me every time we met cuz I
 
kept telling me every time we met cuz I
was actually hiring, which is the only
 
was actually hiring, which is the only
reason I was talking with her. And she
 
reason I was talking with her. And she
would, you know, pick my brain. I I have
 
would, you know, pick my brain. I I have
this interesting company. I'm having
 
this interesting company. I'm having
trouble finding the best candidate. It's
 
trouble finding the best candidate. It's
so unique. And then she would present me
 
so unique. And then she would present me
with a challenge the company was having.
 
with a challenge the company was having.
And so in my next weekly sync with her,
 
And so in my next weekly sync with her,
she knew I was stewing on it and think
 
she knew I was stewing on it and think
about but she wouldn't tell me the name
 
about but she wouldn't tell me the name
of the company. And so I'd come back
 
of the company. And so I'd come back
thinking about the challenges this
 
thinking about the challenges this
organization was facing. I'd be like,
 
organization was facing. I'd be like,
"Have they thought about this? Have you
 
"Have they thought about this? Have you
have you have you introduced someone
 
have you have you introduced someone
with this profile?" Blah blah blah. And
 
with this profile?" Blah blah blah. And
then soon enough, I was already in love.
 
then soon enough, I was already in love.
She knew I was invested. And so push
 
She knew I was invested. And so push
came to shove. She actually did not tell
 
came to shove. She actually did not tell
me the name of the company until I was
 
me the name of the company until I was
in an Uber getting out on site. That's
 
in an Uber getting out on site. That's
because that's how bad of a brand the
 
because that's how bad of a brand the
the company was at that particular
 
the company was at that particular
moment.
 
moment.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
 
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They had had three CEOs in less
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They had had three CEOs in less
than a year. They were in the news for
 
than a year. They were in the news for
all the wrong reasons. This was the
 
all the wrong reasons. This was the
beginning of the turnaround. And so I
 
beginning of the turnaround. And so I
was one of the first executive hires
 
was one of the first executive hires
that was made by that team, including
 
that was made by that team, including
Alexis, to say, "Hey, something that we
 
Alexis, to say, "Hey, something that we
want to do different in this chapter and
 
want to do different in this chapter and
something we know that's deeply
 
something we know that's deeply
important is finally put a focus on
 
important is finally put a focus on
people." And I think that when you are
 
people." And I think that when you are
doing something very hard, I think that
 
doing something very hard, I think that
most of us have had this experience.
 
most of us have had this experience.
When you are truly doing something that
 
When you are truly doing something that
is very, very, very hard, it builds a
 
is very, very, very hard, it builds a
deeper bond faster. And so having been
 
deeper bond faster. And so having been
in the trenches with Alexis, having, you
 
in the trenches with Alexis, having, you
know, we we our employees when I started
 
know, we we our employees when I started
refused to wear the company merch on the
 
refused to wear the company merch on the
street, they wouldn't wear the swag
 
street, they wouldn't wear the swag
because they were they would get bullied
 
because they were they would get bullied
or picked on or they were embarrassed to
 
or picked on or they were embarrassed to
work at that company at that time. And
 
work at that company at that time. And
so to see the transition and and that's
 
so to see the transition and and that's
you know that's such a small indicator
 
you know that's such a small indicator
of of the health of an organization but
 
of of the health of an organization but
the amount of change that we were able
 
the amount of change that we were able
to create together as that that newly
 
to create together as that that newly
formed leadership team was one of the
 
formed leadership team was one of the
best rides of my career. But Kaitlin,

Reddit was going to be hard for me. I
 
Reddit was going to be hard for me. I
had such deep love and connection and
 
had such deep love and connection and
care and that has developed into
 
care and that has developed into
incredible opportunity for me. or I can
 
incredible opportunity for me. or I can
really lean into this work that I've
 
really lean into this work that I've
been doing with initialized which it had
 
been doing with initialized which it had
become very clear to me that all of the
 
become very clear to me that all of the
critical skill sets needed for early
 
critical skill sets needed for early
stage investing after the check is
 
stage investing after the check is
written they are people skills they are
 
written they are people skills they are
the skill sets that I had been building
 
the skill sets that I had been building
for 10 years at that point to say you
 
for 10 years at that point to say you
know whether it is finding that deal
 
know whether it is finding that deal
right so that's a function of recruiting
 
right so that's a function of recruiting
it's you you must have a healthy built
 
it's you you must have a healthy built
relationship and network within an area
 
relationship and network within an area
that you are passionate about the
 
that you are passionate about the
parallel between recruiting and that is
 
parallel between recruiting and that is
the same. It is the same skill set, the
 
the same. It is the same skill set, the
same mental, even the same spreadsheets
 
same mental, even the same spreadsheets
for me, right? And then after the check
 
for me, right? And then after the check
is written, which a lot of people argue,
 
is written, which a lot of people argue,
myself included, um
 
myself included, um
that first chapter of company building,
 
that first chapter of company building,
preede, seed stage, it's that 0ero to
 
preede, seed stage, it's that 0ero to
one. Almost all of those challenges are
 
one. Almost all of those challenges are
going to be people challenges. Building
 
going to be people challenges. Building
early teams, functional dynamics of
 
early teams, functional dynamics of
those teams, compensation. So, how do I
 
those teams, compensation. So, how do I
fairly compensate? How do I build my cap
 
fairly compensate? How do I build my cap
table with those early employees around
 
table with those early employees around
equity? How do I deal with remote and
 
equity? How do I deal with remote and
distributed work? All of these things
 
distributed work? All of these things
are the work that we are already doing.
 
are the work that we are already doing.
We're just doing it inside of one
 
We're just doing it inside of one
organization. And so it occurred to me
 
organization. And so it occurred to me
as I was advising for a number of these
 
as I was advising for a number of these
companies and as I was developing my own
 
companies and as I was developing my own
portfolio, I was like, why don't more HR
 
portfolio, I was like, why don't more HR
people uh work in venture? And so then I
 
people uh work in venture? And so then I
went down a rabbit hole of investigating
 
went down a rabbit hole of investigating
who are the people who have these
 
who are the people who have these
backgrounds. But what I discovered was
 
backgrounds. But what I discovered was
the people who had the same skill sets
 
the people who had the same skill sets
as me
 
as me
were sitting in the back room. They are
 
were sitting in the back room. They are
sitting in the back room and they are
 
sitting in the back room and they are
given the title of either HR or they are
 
given the title of either HR or they are
called talent partner and the work that
 
called talent partner and the work that
that talent partner is given is almost
 
that talent partner is given is almost
exclusively recruiting. So a glorified
 
exclusively recruiting. So a glorified
executive recruiter and I say that not
 
executive recruiter and I say that not
because I want to speak ill of anyone
 
because I want to speak ill of anyone
with the talent partner title but to to
 
with the talent partner title but to to
actually speak very positively of them
 
actually speak very positively of them
and say they are capable of doing so
 
and say they are capable of doing so
much more and having such a bigger
 
much more and having such a bigger
impact again on the business outcomes.

picking takes time to learn and company
 
picking takes time to learn and company
picking is a lot different than company

are at a seminal moment with that alone.
 
are at a seminal moment with that alone.
And so venture capital has been
 
And so venture capital has been
undisrupted despite them investing in
 
undisrupted despite them investing in
disruptive companies for you know the
 
disruptive companies for you know the
last several decades
 
last several decades
is no longer working. And so what we are
 
is no longer working. And so what we are
seeing in the more traditional venture
 
seeing in the more traditional venture
capital firms is they are growing the
 
capital firms is they are growing the
part of their internal business that
 
part of their internal business that
actually leans more on support than
 
actually leans more on support than
selection. But I do think that one of
 
selection. But I do think that one of
the reasons that that we stand out in a
 
the reasons that that we stand out in a
crowded market to say please take our
 
crowded market to say please take our
money um is because we have built our
 
money um is because we have built our
reputation around being product and
 
reputation around being product and
people first. Our team just looks
 
people first. Our team just looks
different when you look at our profiles
 
different when you look at our profiles
and you look at how we've designed our
 
and you look at how we've designed our
our not only our team but our processes.
 
our not only our team but our processes.
And so, you know, one thing that we
 
And so, you know, one thing that we
built is called our growth and
 
built is called our growth and
caregiving program where we actually are
 
caregiving program where we actually are
carving out dollars for every investment
 
carving out dollars for every investment
we make into a preed and seed stage
 
we make into a preed and seed stage
company to actually support the human
 
company to actually support the human
and Kelly to your point, the human who
 
and Kelly to your point, the human who
is building this because founders are,
 
is building this because founders are,
you know, they are strapped for cash,
 
you know, they are strapped for cash,
especially right now in this market,
 
especially right now in this market,
everything is about reducing your burn
 
everything is about reducing your burn
rate. And so, the last thing they're
 
rate. And so, the last thing they're
going to invest in is heaven forbid
 
going to invest in is heaven forbid
mental health. Heaven forbid, you know,
 
mental health. Heaven forbid, you know,
taking that date night and having a
 
taking that date night and having a
babysitter. That is how we're going to
 
babysitter. That is how we're going to
get more checkbooks, not backroom gigs
 
get more checkbooks, not backroom gigs
for people who have deep deep HR
 
for people who have deep deep HR
experience. This is how we're going to
 
experience. This is how we're going to
get the the checkbook in those hands.
 
get the the checkbook in those hands.
And that is my goal. I really
 
And that is my goal. I really
desperately think that our world would
 
desperately think that our world would
be a better place if we had more people
 
be a better place if we had more people
who had
 
who had
depth of care and operational excellence
 
depth of care and operational excellence
and experience in building organizations
 
and experience in building organizations
who have had successful business
 
who have had successful business
outcomes in our industry. I really
 
outcomes in our industry. I really
desperately think that this is what's
 
desperately think that this is what's
needed and we're starting to see it
 
needed and we're starting to see it
happen and it makes me so happy.
 
happen and it makes me so happy.
&gt;&gt; I guess Caitlyn, a question for you.
 
&gt;&gt; I guess Caitlyn, a question for you.
What are one to two things that folks in
 
What are one to two things that folks in
the operating seat, maybe they're in the
 
the operating seat, maybe they're in the
operating seat for a period of months or
 
operating seat for a period of months or
years before they think about this? What
 
years before they think about this? What
should they be doing now to like have
 
should they be doing now to like have
the confidence and the ability to to be
 
the confidence and the ability to to be
that army you speak of?
 
that army you speak of?
&gt;&gt; Best question ever. My biggest piece of
 
&gt;&gt; Best question ever. My biggest piece of
advice would be building your
 
advice would be building your
relationship with founders. And I say
 
relationship with founders. And I say
that and it sounds opposite than like
 
that and it sounds opposite than like
build relationship with investors or
 
build relationship with investors or
build relationships with venture capital
 
build relationships with venture capital
firms. It's actually build your
 
firms. It's actually build your
relationship and build your reputation
 
relationship and build your reputation
with founders. So there is this unspoken
 
with founders. So there is this unspoken
like NPS score between founders that say
 
like NPS score between founders that say
that person was helpful, that person was
 
that person was helpful, that person was
not. There is nothing more frustrating
 
not. There is nothing more frustrating
than than a VC showing up saying, "How
 
than than a VC showing up saying, "How
can I be helpful?" and then literally
 
can I be helpful?" and then literally
ghosting. And that is what occurs nine
 
ghosting. And that is what occurs nine
times out of 10. And so what I
 
times out of 10. And so what I
discovered early in my advising days and
 
discovered early in my advising days and
my angel investing days was that I was
 
my angel investing days was that I was
the only person in their orbit and on
 
the only person in their orbit and on
their cap table. And I can talk about
 
their cap table. And I can talk about
how you get on cap tables without money
 
how you get on cap tables without money
because I also think that's that's a
 
because I also think that's that's a
barrier that I want to remove for people
 
barrier that I want to remove for people
because oftent times that venture has
 
because oftent times that venture has
very intentionally put money as a
 
very intentionally put money as a
blocker for to get people into the
 
blocker for to get people into the
industry. And so I have tools and
 
industry. And so I have tools and
techniques on how to do it. But there is
 
techniques on how to do it. But there is
a very clear path. If you have this
 
a very clear path. If you have this
skill set, you are auto value ad to any
 
skill set, you are auto value ad to any
founder. By looking into your own
 
founder. By looking into your own
network and your relationships that you
 
network and your relationships that you
have around people who are out there
 
have around people who are out there
actually doing the hard work of building
 
actually doing the hard work of building
a company by being a source of value for
 
a company by being a source of value for
them genuinely and truly, I guarantee
 
them genuinely and truly, I guarantee
you, you will be the only one in their
 
you, you will be the only one in their
orbit. Let's start within their orbit,
 
orbit. Let's start within their orbit,
not just on their cap table and maybe
 
not just on their cap table and maybe
not yet, but you will be the one that
 
not yet, but you will be the one that
they come to time and time again. And
 
they come to time and time again. And
when someone asks them, "Dear so and so,
 
when someone asks them, "Dear so and so,
who has been the most helpful?" As they
 
who has been the most helpful?" As they
as they are ringing the bell on IPO day,
 
as they are ringing the bell on IPO day,
or they just have sold their company for
 
or they just have sold their company for
a few billion dollars, think back to
 
a few billion dollars, think back to
that first chapter. Who is the most
 
that first chapter. Who is the most
helpful person? If it is your name,
 
helpful person? If it is your name,
because you coached them through how to
 
because you coached them through how to
break up with their co-founder, or you
 
break up with their co-founder, or you
helped bring on their new COO who
 
helped bring on their new COO who
changed the name of the game at a
 
changed the name of the game at a
milestone moment, that is absolutely
 
milestone moment, that is absolutely
your investor, reputation, and brand.
 
your investor, reputation, and brand.
And so that honestly was how I broke in
 
And so that honestly was how I broke in
was by simply building my name and my
 
was by simply building my name and my
reputation amongst the best founders in
 
reputation amongst the best founders in
the world.
 
the world.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Let me build off that really fast
 
&gt;&gt; Yep. Let me build off that really fast
because like as a founder I can
 
because like as a founder I can
hypervalidate what you just said. I
 
hypervalidate what you just said. I
think the best advice I get is when it
 
think the best advice I get is when it
is coming from somebody who has deep
 
is coming from somebody who has deep
experience in the thing that I need
 
experience in the thing that I need
advice on. And then the second best
 
advice on. And then the second best
advice I get is I don't know but I know
 
advice I get is I don't know but I know
someone that does and I can put you in
 
someone that does and I can put you in
contact with them. And I find that the
 
contact with them. And I find that the
worst advice I get is when someone is
 
worst advice I get is when someone is
trying to give me advice on a topic that
 
trying to give me advice on a topic that
they actually don't know about.
 
they actually don't know about.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's why I say your
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's why I say your
existing relationships like where so if
 
existing relationships like where so if
you have a founder say like I would love
 
you have a founder say like I would love
to but I don't know how or my VC you
 
to but I don't know how or my VC you
know my partner my primary investor
 
know my partner my primary investor
won't let me. I'm so that's a so I'm
 
won't let me. I'm so that's a so I'm
glad you clarified. I would never ever
 
glad you clarified. I would never ever
&gt;&gt; totally and correct me if I'm wrong
 
&gt;&gt; totally and correct me if I'm wrong
Nolan. I mean you have to enjoy it. You
 
Nolan. I mean you have to enjoy it. You
have to literally be genuine about
 
have to literally be genuine about
wanting to freaking help. I mean, I
 
wanting to freaking help. I mean, I
think I talk to at least two to three
 
think I talk to at least two to three
founder CEOs a month just like for free.
 
founder CEOs a month just like for free.
Like I I love it. You know, hey, they
 
Like I I love it. You know, hey, they
have a question. They're interested.
 
have a question. They're interested.
They're hiring ahead of people. You make
 
They're hiring ahead of people. You make
connections, you give back, those
 
connections, you give back, those
relationships continue. I mean, some of
 
relationships continue. I mean, some of
those have gone on to be equity based
 
those have gone on to be equity based
adviserss, other haven't. It's fine
 
adviserss, other haven't. It's fine
because it all works out. And founders
 
because it all works out. And founders
can tell, right? Right? I mean, we all
 
can tell, right? Right? I mean, we all
get as humans, you can tell whether
 
get as humans, you can tell whether
you're there for a certain agenda or
 
you're there for a certain agenda or
you're kind of half in for for a dollar
 
you're kind of half in for for a dollar
versus this is what I love doing. I love
 
versus this is what I love doing. I love
building relationships. I want to help
 
building relationships. I want to help
you and that generally leads out. So,
 
you and that generally leads out. So,
that's always take the calls. It it
 
that's always take the calls. It it
never hurts, you know, and give back.
 
never hurts, you know, and give back.
&gt;&gt; Totally. one of the most reputable and
 
&gt;&gt; Totally. one of the most reputable and
well-known adviserss that I know
 
well-known adviserss that I know
actually won't even take equity until
 
actually won't even take equity until
she spent four to six hours with the
 
she spent four to six hours with the
founder because she's like, I actually
 
founder because she's like, I actually
want to assess that this works for me
 
want to assess that this works for me
too and that I want to work with you.
 
too and that I want to work with you.
And so even though it's counterintuitive
 
And so even though it's counterintuitive
to give away your time for free, it's
 
to give away your time for free, it's
best for everybody involved.
 
best for everybody involved.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
 
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; But and it's never for free. There's
 
&gt;&gt; But and it's never for free. There's
always a benefit. Yeah. There there's
 
always a benefit. Yeah. There there's
always an intrinsic or equ.
 
Yep.
 
Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay, Caitlyn, we'd love to hear any
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, Caitlyn, we'd love to hear any
like a top of your head potent burning
 
like a top of your head potent burning
experiences, events, things in your past
 
experiences, events, things in your past
that have helped you tremendously as far
 
that have helped you tremendously as far
as learnings, good, bad, or ugly, that
 
as learnings, good, bad, or ugly, that
helped you get where you are.
 
helped you get where you are.
&gt;&gt; Oh, there are so many of those. There's
 
&gt;&gt; Oh, there are so many of those. There's
one story. This one comes up for me so
 
one story. This one comes up for me so
often just as like a such a pivotal
 
often just as like a such a pivotal
moment for me. Ed Catmill, president of
 
moment for me. Ed Catmill, president of
Pixar at the time when I worked there.
 
Pixar at the time when I worked there.
He and I had a conversation around my
 
He and I had a conversation around my
career and my development because I
 
career and my development because I
started at Pixar as an executive
 
started at Pixar as an executive
assistant and that was a deviation from
 
assistant and that was a deviation from
what I had done previously and it was
 
what I had done previously and it was
not necessarily what I wanted to do
 
not necessarily what I wanted to do
going forward although I love that work.
 
going forward although I love that work.
You know, it was a it was a total
 
You know, it was a it was a total
hallway conversation. And he said to me,
 
hallway conversation. And he said to me,
"Caitlyn, it takes us 5 years here to
 
"Caitlyn, it takes us 5 years here to
make a film. If you still don't know
 
make a film. If you still don't know
what you want to do when you grow up
 
what you want to do when you grow up
after 5 years, come and let me know
 
after 5 years, come and let me know
because I will have failed you." And I
 
because I will have failed you." And I
quit on almost exactly my 5-year
 
quit on almost exactly my 5-year
anniversary. And it was not because Ed
 
anniversary. And it was not because Ed
had failed me. It was because he had
 
had failed me. It was because he had
given me so much. That organization had
 
given me so much. That organization had
given me so much. And I wanted to take
 
given me so much. And I wanted to take
that and build on it in a new chapter of
 
that and build on it in a new chapter of
my career, in a new in a new industry.
 
my career, in a new in a new industry.
And so that was a really pivotal moment
 
And so that was a really pivotal moment
and I think that that set the groundwork
 
and I think that that set the groundwork
for me for the conversation that we had
 
for me for the conversation that we had
earlier around knowing when to leap. And
 
earlier around knowing when to leap. And
so I left that company when I was the
 
so I left that company when I was the
happiest. But because Ed had given me a
 
happiest. But because Ed had given me a
a he time boxed it for me on accident.
 
a he time boxed it for me on accident.
Um and so I was very cognizant and so as
 
Um and so I was very cognizant and so as
I took on different roles within the
 
I took on different roles within the
organization, I worked in so many
 
organization, I worked in so many
different parts of the studio that when
 
different parts of the studio that when
I got to the end I was like do I know
 
I got to the end I was like do I know
what I want to do when I grow up? And
 
what I want to do when I grow up? And
the answer was no. But it wasn't because
 
the answer was no. But it wasn't because
I was unhappy. It was because I was
 
I was unhappy. It was because I was
developing and I was growing and I
 
developing and I was growing and I
wanted to go do that elsewhere. And so I
 
wanted to go do that elsewhere. And so I
think that he really set me up for that
 
think that he really set me up for that
being just aware and being able to time
 
being just aware and being able to time
box things for myself to make sure that
 
box things for myself to make sure that
I was listening to uh my needs as and
 
I was listening to uh my needs as and
you know as a someone growing a career
 
you know as a someone growing a career
and not knowing what I wanted to do. And
 
and not knowing what I wanted to do. And
I say to this day I still don't know
 
I say to this day I still don't know
what I want to do. I love what I'm doing
 
what I want to do. I love what I'm doing
and I don't know what I want to do when
 
and I don't know what I want to do when
I grow up. Um and I think that's a
 
I grow up. Um and I think that's a
beautiful place to be. Um so that's the
 
beautiful place to be. Um so that's the
one that comes top of mind.
 
one that comes top of mind.
