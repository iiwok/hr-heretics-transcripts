For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, we interview Caitlyn Holloway,
founding partner at 776. Caitlyn
challenges venture capital orthodoxy,
demonstrating why HR professionals
should claim checkbook authority over
traditional finance backgrounds in early
stage investing. Hey everybody, welcome
back to the HR Heretics podcast where we
get into the real talk of company
construction. These are the
conversations that happen between
founders, chief people officers, and
board members behind closed doors.
Today our episode is with Caitlyn
Holloway. Caitlyn is a partner at 776,
the VC firm she and Alexis O'hanian run
together. Caitlyn was the former VP of
people at Reddit and worked at Clout and
Pixar before that. She's also known to
many HR pros because she's the host of a
podcast called All Hands from Lattis,
which is awesome. Here's our
conversation with Caitlyn, everybody.
&gt;&gt; Caitlyn, thanks so much for joining us
on the show.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me. I'm
thrilled to be here.
&gt;&gt; So, I I want to just start quickly with
your background. You're currently a
partner at 776.
You were also the head of people at
Reddit from like 70 to more than 700.
How did you initially get into people in
HR?
&gt;&gt; Uh that is a good question. So yeah, how
did I get into HR? Um was totally an
accident. A lot of the best folks in our
industry are people who I think will say
HR found me. It it's almost always HR
found me. And I think that part of that
is because the world of HR prior to what
 
was so not a destination career. But I I
think that most people found it on
accident because it was they were
naturally drawn to or they were in an
organization where people were coming to
them, people were confiding in them. And
so it really was a community role, an
internal community role. So, prior to
getting into the world of tech and the
world of HR, I was at Pixar Animation
Studios where I never held an HR
position. But what I like to say is I
was a client and a very happy client of
the HR and people function at Pixar. And
I really credit that team with teaching
me so much about what great HR looks
like. And so when I eventually left the
studio and I did move into tech, it was
it was an opportunity to take all of the
incredible things that I had learned
there as a customer to say, gosh, I love
the way they built out their learning
and development system. Looking at the
Pixar University model, for example,
they didn't call it learning and
development. It was the Pixar
University. And it's funny because it
was called PU. And the beauty of that
program was they allowed anybody in the
studio regardless of your role, your
title, your tenure, your salary,
anything could attend any course. they
they saw that you could develop uh deep
relationships and move the business
forward and unpack and and discover
creative ideas that could then be put
into the film or put into a part of the
process from all different parts of the
organization. And so for me that was not
we need to have a learning and
development uh system. It was how do we
live the value great ideas come from
anywhere. So, Caitlin, you've been
working with Alexis O'Hania now for I
think about 9 years.
&gt;&gt; How did you meet Alexis and how has that
relationship evolved over time?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, how I met him was he hired me
at Reddit. So, during the big
turnaround, I think that we first met in
 
kept telling me every time we met cuz I
was actually hiring, which is the only
reason I was talking with her. And she
would, you know, pick my brain. I I have
this interesting company. I'm having
trouble finding the best candidate. It's
so unique. And then she would present me
with a challenge the company was having.
And so in my next weekly sync with her,
she knew I was stewing on it and think
about but she wouldn't tell me the name
of the company. And so I'd come back
thinking about the challenges this
organization was facing. I'd be like,
"Have they thought about this? Have you
have you have you introduced someone
with this profile?" Blah blah blah. And
then soon enough, I was already in love.
She knew I was invested. And so push
came to shove. She actually did not tell
me the name of the company until I was
in an Uber getting out on site. That's
because that's how bad of a brand the
the company was at that particular
moment.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They had had three CEOs in less
than a year. They were in the news for
all the wrong reasons. This was the
beginning of the turnaround. And so I
was one of the first executive hires
that was made by that team, including
Alexis, to say, "Hey, something that we
want to do different in this chapter and
something we know that's deeply
important is finally put a focus on
people." And I think that when you are
doing something very hard, I think that
most of us have had this experience.
When you are truly doing something that
is very, very, very hard, it builds a
deeper bond faster. And so having been
in the trenches with Alexis, having, you
know, we we our employees when I started
refused to wear the company merch on the
street, they wouldn't wear the swag
because they were they would get bullied
or picked on or they were embarrassed to
work at that company at that time. And
so to see the transition and and that's
you know that's such a small indicator
of of the health of an organization but
the amount of change that we were able
to create together as that that newly
formed leadership team was one of the
best rides of my career. But Kaitlin,
your acceleration into venture has been
just so freaking fun to watch and I know
you have such a strong point of view and
are making a lot of noise in a great way
about more of you, more of us, more of
people leaders into venture and I'd love
to talk about it.
&gt;&gt; I'm so glad that you were bringing this
up because this is absolutely one of my
biggest points of passion right now. I
feel so lucky to have entered the the
workforce within the the people and
culture sphere when I did and I I talk
about it as you know dragging HR out of
the back room into the boardroom. But
it's awesome because the community that
existed that predated you know HR 2.0
know was so open and willing and saying
yes yes yes let's link arms and so there
was no us versus them when this moment
of change this this this need for you
know the change catalyst that had to
occur to to make that happen not just
for our industry for the sake of our own
career development but really for the
sake of business outcomes right and and
so beating my fists on the table around
business outcomes where this is not nice
to have this is not soft fluffy let's
make the HR folk feel seen
This was about how do we augment
business outcomes and so what occurred
to me you know after I feel like we've
had this major revolution where we are
now it is just common place which is
exactly where you want to get that the
voice of human resources or people and
culture is heard and reverberates
throughout the organization and that
that is inclusive of the boardroom it is
inclusive of the executive room. I knew
that I was needing to make a transition
and I was looking down the the path. I
was staring at the fork in the road and
I thought, okay, I can go and run a
playbook that I know and love and work
that I'm deeply and desperately
passionate about. Again, finding another
Reddit was going to be hard for me. I
had such deep love and connection and
care and that has developed into
incredible opportunity for me. or I can
really lean into this work that I've
been doing with initialized which it had
become very clear to me that all of the
critical skill sets needed for early
stage investing after the check is
written they are people skills they are
the skill sets that I had been building
for 10 years at that point to say you
know whether it is finding that deal
right so that's a function of recruiting
it's you you must have a healthy built
relationship and network within an area
that you are passionate about the
parallel between recruiting and that is
the same. It is the same skill set, the
same mental, even the same spreadsheets
for me, right? And then after the check
is written, which a lot of people argue,
myself included, um
that first chapter of company building,
preede, seed stage, it's that 0ero to
one. Almost all of those challenges are
going to be people challenges. Building
early teams, functional dynamics of
those teams, compensation. So, how do I
fairly compensate? How do I build my cap
table with those early employees around
equity? How do I deal with remote and
distributed work? All of these things
are the work that we are already doing.
We're just doing it inside of one
organization. And so it occurred to me
as I was advising for a number of these
companies and as I was developing my own
portfolio, I was like, why don't more HR
people uh work in venture? And so then I
went down a rabbit hole of investigating
who are the people who have these
backgrounds. But what I discovered was
the people who had the same skill sets
as me
were sitting in the back room. They are
sitting in the back room and they are
given the title of either HR or they are
called talent partner and the work that
that talent partner is given is almost
exclusively recruiting. So a glorified
executive recruiter and I say that not
because I want to speak ill of anyone
with the talent partner title but to to
actually speak very positively of them
and say they are capable of doing so
much more and having such a bigger
impact again on the business outcomes.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.

because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes

I think what they would say, Caitlyn, is
that there's the skill of company
picking takes time to learn and company
picking is a lot different than company
operating. And so I'd say that's one
skill set that I have personally heard.
The other one is the the Mark Andre
quote which I'll butcher, but it's
something along the lines of like most
of venture is negative selection and the
positive selection of venture, the
companies you really want to take your
money, they have to pick you. And so
that's where I I'm actually curious to
get your take on this is how does an HR
person crack in when that is what
they're competing against? I like to
spar a little bit, you know, if you
haven't realized, but the picking a lot
of these, and Caitlyn, I love your
thoughts on this, is picking the
founder, right? I've heard oodles of
times, and I agree with it. You're not
investing in usually the thing or the
widget. You're investing in that human.
You're investing in that founder, which
now we're back to recruiting and exactly
what you talked about, Caitlyn. So, I'd
love you to weave that in, too. But I do
believe that. I I believe that
wholeheartedly and I want to make it
clear. I think that this is a yes and
this is a you know we just need more
perspective at the table and different
skill sets at the table. We are at the
precipice. We are sitting on this edge
of shift and change. It is a platform
shift. It is a seinal moment in
technology and the broader ecosystem the
broader economy though the the global
economy right this is not a debate on is
AI taking our jobs I promise. Um but
that that is a huge platform shift. We
are at a seminal moment with that alone.
And so venture capital has been
undisrupted despite them investing in
disruptive companies for you know the
last several decades
is no longer working. And so what we are
seeing in the more traditional venture
capital firms is they are growing the
part of their internal business that
actually leans more on support than
selection. But I do think that one of
the reasons that that we stand out in a
crowded market to say please take our
money um is because we have built our
reputation around being product and
people first. Our team just looks
different when you look at our profiles
and you look at how we've designed our
our not only our team but our processes.
And so, you know, one thing that we
built is called our growth and
caregiving program where we actually are
carving out dollars for every investment
we make into a preed and seed stage
company to actually support the human
and Kelly to your point, the human who
is building this because founders are,
you know, they are strapped for cash,
especially right now in this market,
everything is about reducing your burn
rate. And so, the last thing they're
going to invest in is heaven forbid
mental health. Heaven forbid, you know,
taking that date night and having a
babysitter. That is how we're going to
get more checkbooks, not backroom gigs
for people who have deep deep HR
experience. This is how we're going to
get the the checkbook in those hands.
And that is my goal. I really
desperately think that our world would
be a better place if we had more people
who had
depth of care and operational excellence
and experience in building organizations
who have had successful business
outcomes in our industry. I really
desperately think that this is what's
needed and we're starting to see it
happen and it makes me so happy.
&gt;&gt; I guess Caitlyn, a question for you.
What are one to two things that folks in
the operating seat, maybe they're in the
operating seat for a period of months or
years before they think about this? What
should they be doing now to like have
the confidence and the ability to to be
that army you speak of?
&gt;&gt; Best question ever. My biggest piece of
advice would be building your
relationship with founders. And I say
that and it sounds opposite than like
build relationship with investors or
build relationships with venture capital
firms. It's actually build your
relationship and build your reputation
with founders. So there is this unspoken
like NPS score between founders that say
that person was helpful, that person was
not. There is nothing more frustrating
than than a VC showing up saying, "How
can I be helpful?" and then literally
ghosting. And that is what occurs nine
times out of 10. And so what I
discovered early in my advising days and
my angel investing days was that I was
the only person in their orbit and on
their cap table. And I can talk about
how you get on cap tables without money
because I also think that's that's a
barrier that I want to remove for people
because oftent times that venture has
very intentionally put money as a
blocker for to get people into the
industry. And so I have tools and
techniques on how to do it. But there is
a very clear path. If you have this
skill set, you are auto value ad to any
founder. By looking into your own
network and your relationships that you
have around people who are out there
actually doing the hard work of building
a company by being a source of value for
them genuinely and truly, I guarantee
you, you will be the only one in their
orbit. Let's start within their orbit,
not just on their cap table and maybe
not yet, but you will be the one that
they come to time and time again. And
when someone asks them, "Dear so and so,
who has been the most helpful?" As they
as they are ringing the bell on IPO day,
or they just have sold their company for
a few billion dollars, think back to
that first chapter. Who is the most
helpful person? If it is your name,
because you coached them through how to
break up with their co-founder, or you
helped bring on their new COO who
changed the name of the game at a
milestone moment, that is absolutely
your investor, reputation, and brand.
And so that honestly was how I broke in
was by simply building my name and my
reputation amongst the best founders in
the world.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Let me build off that really fast
because like as a founder I can
hypervalidate what you just said. I
think the best advice I get is when it
is coming from somebody who has deep
experience in the thing that I need
advice on. And then the second best
advice I get is I don't know but I know
someone that does and I can put you in
contact with them. And I find that the
worst advice I get is when someone is
trying to give me advice on a topic that
they actually don't know about.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's why I say your
existing relationships like where so if
you have a founder say like I would love
to but I don't know how or my VC you
know my partner my primary investor
won't let me. I'm so that's a so I'm
glad you clarified. I would never ever
&gt;&gt; totally and correct me if I'm wrong
Nolan. I mean you have to enjoy it. You
have to literally be genuine about
wanting to freaking help. I mean, I
think I talk to at least two to three
founder CEOs a month just like for free.
Like I I love it. You know, hey, they
have a question. They're interested.
They're hiring ahead of people. You make
connections, you give back, those
relationships continue. I mean, some of
those have gone on to be equity based
adviserss, other haven't. It's fine
because it all works out. And founders
can tell, right? Right? I mean, we all
get as humans, you can tell whether
you're there for a certain agenda or
you're kind of half in for for a dollar
versus this is what I love doing. I love
building relationships. I want to help
you and that generally leads out. So,
that's always take the calls. It it
never hurts, you know, and give back.
&gt;&gt; Totally. one of the most reputable and
well-known adviserss that I know
actually won't even take equity until
she spent four to six hours with the
founder because she's like, I actually
want to assess that this works for me
too and that I want to work with you.
And so even though it's counterintuitive
to give away your time for free, it's
best for everybody involved.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; But and it's never for free. There's
always a benefit. Yeah. There there's
always an intrinsic or equ.
 
Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay, Caitlyn, we'd love to hear any
like a top of your head potent burning
experiences, events, things in your past
that have helped you tremendously as far
as learnings, good, bad, or ugly, that
helped you get where you are.
&gt;&gt; Oh, there are so many of those. There's
one story. This one comes up for me so
often just as like a such a pivotal
moment for me. Ed Catmill, president of
Pixar at the time when I worked there.
He and I had a conversation around my
career and my development because I
started at Pixar as an executive
assistant and that was a deviation from
what I had done previously and it was
not necessarily what I wanted to do
going forward although I love that work.
You know, it was a it was a total
hallway conversation. And he said to me,
"Caitlyn, it takes us 5 years here to
make a film. If you still don't know
what you want to do when you grow up
after 5 years, come and let me know
because I will have failed you." And I
quit on almost exactly my 5-year
anniversary. And it was not because Ed
had failed me. It was because he had
given me so much. That organization had
given me so much. And I wanted to take
that and build on it in a new chapter of
my career, in a new in a new industry.
And so that was a really pivotal moment
and I think that that set the groundwork
for me for the conversation that we had
earlier around knowing when to leap. And
so I left that company when I was the
happiest. But because Ed had given me a
a he time boxed it for me on accident.
Um and so I was very cognizant and so as
I took on different roles within the
organization, I worked in so many
different parts of the studio that when
I got to the end I was like do I know
what I want to do when I grow up? And
the answer was no. But it wasn't because
I was unhappy. It was because I was
developing and I was growing and I
wanted to go do that elsewhere. And so I
think that he really set me up for that
being just aware and being able to time
box things for myself to make sure that
I was listening to uh my needs as and
you know as a someone growing a career
and not knowing what I wanted to do. And
I say to this day I still don't know
what I want to do. I love what I'm doing
and I don't know what I want to do when
I grow up. Um and I think that's a
beautiful place to be. Um so that's the
one that comes top of mind.
&gt;&gt; Love it. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I feel the exact same way.
Like everyone says like, "Oh, it seems
like you have it figured out." And I'm
like, "I have nothing figured out." And
it turns out like the smartest people
when you talk to them, they're all like,
"Yeah, I'm just on this crazy journey
that's called life." And I just follow
where the the path takes me.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps that's the right answer.
&gt;&gt; Caitlyn, on that note, thank you so much
for joining us. We've had an absolute
blast learning from you, and our
audience is going to love this show.
Thank you for the time.
&gt;&gt; Ditto. Thank you so much, Caitlyn. Oh, I
am so grateful for being invited on.
Like I said, I'm a big fan of the show
and a big fan of the audience. So, it is
my pleasure to join you. Thank you so
much for having me. HR Heretics is a
