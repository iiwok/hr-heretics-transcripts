&gt;&gt; really. Yeah. Okay, everyone. Well, hope

you're all doing good out there. Um got
a question last week and I talked to my
 
a question last week and I talked to my
friend about it. Thought I'd put it on
 
friend about it. Thought I'd put it on
Dear Heretics because she asked me a
 
Dear Heretics because she asked me a
question about stock options. And the
 
question about stock options. And the
question Nolan specifically was, "Hey,
 
question Nolan specifically was, "Hey,
well, specifically was, "Hey pal, I'm
 
well, specifically was, "Hey pal, I'm
talking to my CEO and we're kind of
 
talking to my CEO and we're kind of
arguing over whether everyone should get
 
arguing over whether everyone should get
stock options or only certain levels."
 
stock options or only certain levels."
Like they don't want to give SDRs, for
 
Like they don't want to give SDRs, for
example, stock options. What do you
 
example, stock options. What do you
think? Would love your advice.
 
think? Would love your advice.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, you know, I worked at
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, you know, I worked at
Carta and uh our goal at Carta was to
 
Carta and uh our goal at Carta was to
make everyone an owner. And one of the
 
make everyone an owner. And one of the
hypotheses around the software was if we
 
hypotheses around the software was if we
made it easier for companies to issue
 
made it easier for companies to issue
equity, then more companies would issue
 
equity, then more companies would issue
equity because it's kind of a pain in
 
equity because it's kind of a pain in
the ass if you have to like hit up your
 
the ass if you have to like hit up your
lawyer and it's like paper certificates
 
lawyer and it's like paper certificates
and stuff. So, the story I used to tell
 
and stuff. So, the story I used to tell
candidates, which is true, is like my
 
candidates, which is true, is like my
dad has been in sales his entire life.
 
dad has been in sales his entire life.
Um, and specifically in sales, and you
 
Um, and specifically in sales, and you
still see this in tech companies, like
 
still see this in tech companies, like
back in the day, they never got equity.
 
back in the day, they never got equity.
And even still today, most of them
 
And even still today, most of them
don't. And I feel like if you're
 
don't. And I feel like if you're
transactional
 
transactional
in your relationship with employees, so
 
in your relationship with employees, so
like, hey, this is the number, this is
 
like, hey, this is the number, this is
your quota, go hit this thing. You think
 
your quota, go hit this thing. You think
on short time horizons and you make
 
on short time horizons and you make
decisions on short time horizons. Uh,
 
decisions on short time horizons. Uh,
utopia for me is everybody is an owner.
 
utopia for me is everybody is an owner.
Now to take the other side of that,
 
Now to take the other side of that,
objectively investors hate it. And I
 
objectively investors hate it. And I
learned this um it turns out like
 
learned this um it turns out like
investors make their money by not
 
investors make their money by not
getting diluted. And the more equity you
 
getting diluted. And the more equity you
issue, the more dilution investors take
 
issue, the more dilution investors take
and they don't like it. They want to get
 
and they don't like it. They want to get
rich. They want to get their LPs rich.
 
rich. They want to get their LPs rich.
It's it's their business model. It's
 
It's it's their business model. It's
not, you know, terrible black ball
 
not, you know, terrible black ball
capitalism sort of a thing. It's just
 
capitalism sort of a thing. It's just
the way that their business model works.
 
the way that their business model works.
And so the more equity they give away,
 
And so the more equity they give away,
the more delution they take, the less
 
the more delution they take, the less
money they make. And so I would just say
 
money they make. And so I would just say
my advice generally high level to this
 
my advice generally high level to this
person is you need to come up with the
 
person is you need to come up with the
ethos what matters to you and your
 
ethos what matters to you and your
company. And the only way you can do
 
company. And the only way you can do
that is with your CEO. What's your take
 
that is with your CEO. What's your take
on this, Kelly? Yeah, I had and I told
 
on this, Kelly? Yeah, I had and I told
her I said, "Look, I have a really
 
her I said, "Look, I have a really
strong opinion on this and it's to give
 
strong opinion on this and it's to give
ownership of the company to everyone
 
ownership of the company to everyone
working their ass off to make it
 
working their ass off to make it
successful." Um, I think it's just a
 
successful." Um, I think it's just a
just from an e immoral standpoint. You
 
just from an e immoral standpoint. You
know, it just feels
 
know, it just feels
strange to me. Um, the other reason is,
 
strange to me. Um, the other reason is,
I mean, I I still to this day I don't
 
I mean, I I still to this day I don't
like doing things or asking other people
 
like doing things or asking other people
to do things or expect stuff from them
 
to do things or expect stuff from them
that I wouldn't do myself. And I just
 
that I wouldn't do myself. And I just
think it it creates just some kind of an
 
think it it creates just some kind of an
equality of like one team. Um, that's
 
equality of like one team. Um, that's
just kind of my utopian view, Nolan. I
 
just kind of my utopian view, Nolan. I
think the defensive kind of like view is
 
think the defensive kind of like view is
it's a huge it's a huge headache. not if
 
it's a huge it's a huge headache. not if
when that AMA will be asked around why
 
when that AMA will be asked around why
you don't give options to everybody and
 
you don't give options to everybody and
that's going to suck because no matter
 
that's going to suck because no matter
what answer you give
 
what answer you give
it's going to linger in the air of your
 
it's going to linger in the air of your
culture and I truly believe that
 
culture and I truly believe that
I think also from a competitive
 
I think also from a competitive
standpoint I've been doing venture you
 
standpoint I've been doing venture you
know public companies before But I've
 
know public companies before But I've
been doing venture for 16 years, I have
 
been doing venture for 16 years, I have
never worked for a company that didn't
 
never worked for a company that didn't
offer it to everyone. So I think if
 
offer it to everyone. So I think if
you're trying to be an ace company with
 
you're trying to be an ace company with
great talent and a great brand and
 
great talent and a great brand and
reputation, I don't know how you acquire
 
reputation, I don't know how you acquire
and keep that talent if you're not
 
and keep that talent if you're not
offering this ownership to everybody.
 
offering this ownership to everybody.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I've never told this story
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I've never told this story
publicly, but um I think I can tell a
 
publicly, but um I think I can tell a
sanitized version of it. Um so
 
sanitized version of it. Um so
&gt;&gt; I hear you say that a lot on your
 
&gt;&gt; I hear you say that a lot on your
podcast. Like what do you have a rolodex
 
podcast. Like what do you have a rolodex
of like secret stories you just pull?
 
of like secret stories you just pull?
&gt;&gt; I Well, you got to be really thoughtful.
 
&gt;&gt; I Well, you got to be really thoughtful.
You got to be really thoughtful about
 
You got to be really thoughtful about
private information, private
 
private information, private
conversations,
 
conversations,
&gt;&gt; uh, and make especially when you're
 
&gt;&gt; uh, and make especially when you're
talking about other people.
 
talking about other people.
&gt;&gt; So, this story I think I can I can tell
 
&gt;&gt; So, this story I think I can I can tell
a sanitized version. So, basically,
 
a sanitized version. So, basically,
&gt;&gt; when we were at Carta, one of the things
 
&gt;&gt; when we were at Carta, one of the things
Henry wanted to do is he wanted to do an
 
Henry wanted to do is he wanted to do an
employee refresh. And so anyways, the
 
employee refresh. And so anyways, the
long and the short of this is one of
 
long and the short of this is one of
Carta's investors is and
 
Carta's investors is and
uh he writes a blog called it's like
 
uh he writes a blog called it's like
it's legendary in Silicon Valley is
 
it's legendary in Silicon Valley is
probably the most
 
probably the most
like sorry maybe not the most the
 
like sorry maybe not the most the
smartest person on equity I've ever met
 
smartest person on equity I've ever met
and I've met a ton of these people met a
 
and I've met a ton of these people met a
ton of comp people met a ton of VCs is
 
ton of comp people met a ton of VCs is
like the top of the food chain. So we go
 
like the top of the food chain. So we go
to and he started asking me questions I
 
to and he started asking me questions I
had never considered. One of which was
 
had never considered. One of which was
Nolan, do you think employees will care
 
Nolan, do you think employees will care
about this after the initial grant?
 
about this after the initial grant?
And here's the thing, Kelly, I think we
 
And here's the thing, Kelly, I think we
get a little bit in the ivory tower on,
 
get a little bit in the ivory tower on,
you know, you and I have been in San
 
you know, you and I have been in San
Francisco, Silicon Valley working with
 
Francisco, Silicon Valley working with
tech companies, highle roles. I've had a
 
tech companies, highle roles. I've had a
bunch of people have big outcomes in our
 
bunch of people have big outcomes in our
circles. It's like we know the game.
 
circles. It's like we know the game.
If you're building, for example, a sales
 
If you're building, for example, a sales
office in Salt Lake,
 
office in Salt Lake,
those employees don't know the game. And
 
those employees don't know the game. And
so if you're giving out equity, what you
 
so if you're giving out equity, what you
would expect in return is people
 
would expect in return is people
playing, like I said earlier, this
 
playing, like I said earlier, this
longer game, making decisions on a
 
longer game, making decisions on a
longer time horizon. But if employees
 
longer time horizon. But if employees
don't understand it, then you're not
 
don't understand it, then you're not
going to get that outcome. And so, what
 
going to get that outcome. And so, what
are you going to do? How are you going
 
are you going to do? How are you going
to educate people on this? So giving out
 
to educate people on this? So giving out
equity actually also creates headaches
 
equity actually also creates headaches
for you because just giving it out is
 
for you because just giving it out is
not a panacea. What do you think about
 
not a panacea. What do you think about
that?
 
that?
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a great point and I will agree
 
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a great point and I will agree
that not everyone understands this and I
 
that not everyone understands this and I
will argue all day long that is not a
 
will argue all day long that is not a
reason not to give it to be like oh well
 
reason not to give it to be like oh well
they don't they don't know that anyway
 
they don't they don't know that anyway
so screw them. We're not we're not going
 
so screw them. We're not we're not going
to give it to them because I do believe
 
to give it to them because I do believe
that one day that will come back to bite
 
that one day that will come back to bite
you. It's kind of like it's kind of like
 
you. It's kind of like it's kind of like
the hourly thing like you know we're not
 
the hourly thing like you know we're not
going to make them hourly whatever their
 
going to make them hourly whatever their
base and then and then a year later
 
base and then and then a year later
they're hourly and they're like wait you
 
they're hourly and they're like wait you
owe us all this overtime what the hell
 
owe us all this overtime what the hell
was going on you were screwing me like
 
was going on you were screwing me like
it's kind of like that I I do think I do
 
it's kind of like that I I do think I do
think that that strategy is just kind of
 
think that that strategy is just kind of
sleazy. I mean, if you're not going to
 
sleazy. I mean, if you're not going to
do it, be open about it and make sure
 
do it, be open about it and make sure
you can explain why in front of a whole
 
you can explain why in front of a whole
company. Fine. Clarity of identity and
 
company. Fine. Clarity of identity and
take your pros and cons for each. But
 
take your pros and cons for each. But
just kind of like sweep it under the rug
 
just kind of like sweep it under the rug
because you don't think they know that
 
because you don't think they know that
will come back. The other thing is
 
will come back. The other thing is
also, I do believe this, if you're going
 
also, I do believe this, if you're going
to give out equity to everybody,
 
to give out equity to everybody,
it is more valuable and useful to you if
 
it is more valuable and useful to you if
you actually tell them
 
you actually tell them
how it works and show them upside
 
how it works and show them upside
scenarios again with asterisks that say
 
scenarios again with asterisks that say
monopoly money. But like at Pendo, we
 
monopoly money. But like at Pendo, we
did a bunch of round tables with our CFO
 
did a bunch of round tables with our CFO
and myself and we talked all about
 
and myself and we talked all about
equity and how it works and upside
 
equity and how it works and upside
scenarios. And you know what? People got
 
scenarios. And you know what? People got
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fired up. Like they were like
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fired up. Like they were like
working hard. They were excited. It
 
working hard. They were excited. It
raised moods. It impacted the culture.
 
raised moods. It impacted the culture.
Like all that stuff snowballs, but you
 
Like all that stuff snowballs, but you
have to actually put some work into it,
 
have to actually put some work into it,
too. So,
 
too. So,
&gt;&gt; okay. Where we're aligned for sure is if
 
&gt;&gt; okay. Where we're aligned for sure is if
you give equity out, you must educate
 
you give equity out, you must educate
employees on how it works. The thing
 
employees on how it works. The thing
that Carta did that was from Henry, this
 
that Carta did that was from Henry, this
is in his better offer letter blog post,
 
is in his better offer letter blog post,
Henry said in the offer letter, "The
 
Henry said in the offer letter, "The
default value you should assign to your
 
default value you should assign to your
equity is $0. Act like you're never
 
equity is $0. Act like you're never
getting anything. Live like you're never
 
getting anything. Live like you're never
getting anything. Never plan on it." And
 
getting anything. Never plan on it." And
I always thought that that was such a
 
I always thought that that was such a
great like floor for the expectation
 
great like floor for the expectation
setting for people because when you do
 
setting for people because when you do
talk about scenarios, all of a sudden
 
talk about scenarios, all of a sudden
people start counting in their head and
 
people start counting in their head and
in their bank accounts money they have
 
in their bank accounts money they have
not received. So I think that's super
 
not received. So I think that's super
super important. But regardless both you
 
super important. But regardless both you
and I agree there is work that goes into
 
and I agree there is work that goes into
teaching people about this. And that
 
teaching people about this. And that
work by the way is never done. It's not
 
work by the way is never done. It's not
like a we did a one-time AMA on equity
 
like a we did a one-time AMA on equity
and now it's over. It's like a you got
 
and now it's over. It's like a you got
to talk about this thing like every six
 
to talk about this thing like every six
months and remind people what it is.
 
months and remind people what it is.
Teach them how it works so it becomes
 
Teach them how it works so it becomes
this neverending body of work and
 
this neverending body of work and
employees will always have questions
 
employees will always have questions
about it. Okay, that's that piece.
 
about it. Okay, that's that piece.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a

The second piece, going back to my
 
The second piece, going back to my
conversation with
 
conversation with
he said, Nolan, how do you plan on
 
he said, Nolan, how do you plan on
accounting for cost of labor
 
accounting for cost of labor
differences
 
differences
in different locations with equity?
 
in different locations with equity?
And that was like a oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I've I
 
And that was like a oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I've I
was like I had not thought about it. We
 
was like I had not thought about it. We
like we have to go think about this now.
 
like we have to go think about this now.
What the first question is is like do
 
What the first question is is like do
you do that? So, what's your philosophy
 
you do that? So, what's your philosophy
on different locations and cost of
 
on different locations and cost of
labor? Most companies will adjust
 
labor? Most companies will adjust
cash compensation depending on the
 
cash compensation depending on the
location of the employee because cost of
 
location of the employee because cost of
labor is different in different markets.
 
labor is different in different markets.
Most companies don't think about that
 
Most companies don't think about that
for equity or they don't have any
 
for equity or they don't have any
structure around it. Most famously, like
 
structure around it. Most famously, like
Google up until recently basically gave
 
Google up until recently basically gave
everybody Google equity as if you were
 
everybody Google equity as if you were
in San Francisco. I believe that's since
 
in San Francisco. I believe that's since
changed. So, what's [clears throat] your
 
changed. So, what's [clears throat] your
take on that, Kelly? Would you do a cost
 
take on that, Kelly? Would you do a cost
of labor adjustment on it?
 
of labor adjustment on it?
&gt;&gt; That is a whole can of worms.
 
&gt;&gt; That is a whole can of worms.
&gt;&gt; I know.
 
&gt;&gt; I know.
&gt;&gt; I mean that that my brain just like went
 
&gt;&gt; I mean that that my brain just like went
light speed through like that all of
 
light speed through like that all of
that and I'm like exhausted now. So
 
that and I'm like exhausted now. So
theoretically I've never I've never done
 
theoretically I've never I've never done
it. I've never adjusted equity for geo.
 
it. I've never adjusted equity for geo.
Right. If we just take it on its face,
 
Right. If we just take it on its face,
theoretically,
 
theoretically,
you probably should because
 
you probably should because
most companies now, I I do, we look at
 
most companies now, I I do, we look at
equity based on dollar value, not just
 
equity based on dollar value, not just
like a random stock unit number. You
 
like a random stock unit number. You
actually look at dollar values. So on
 
actually look at dollar values. So on
that end, you should do it.
 
that end, you should do it.
On the other end, I'm just going to be
 
On the other end, I'm just going to be
kind of negative Nelly here for a
 
kind of negative Nelly here for a
minute. Can you imagine all of the
 
minute. Can you imagine all of the
administrative's
 
administrative's
chaos? Not even chaos, mindnumbing
 
chaos? Not even chaos, mindnumbing
shitow when employees start to complain
 
shitow when employees start to complain
and move and well you gave me this and
 
and move and well you gave me this and
now I moved and so now I need more or
 
now I moved and so now I need more or
this person now you got to reduce their
 
this person now you got to reduce their
equity like
 
equity like
&gt;&gt; driving my life. I
 
&gt;&gt; driving my life. I
&gt;&gt; that is insane. And the second piece of
 
&gt;&gt; that is insane. And the second piece of
it, Nolan, two other factors that make
 
it, Nolan, two other factors that make
my brain hurt. One, the long-term nature
 
my brain hurt. One, the long-term nature
of equity, right? Cash, cost of labor,
 
of equity, right? Cash, cost of labor,
you're using it now. House, mortgage,
 
you're using it now. House, mortgage,
food in that area, whatever it is.
 
food in that area, whatever it is.
Equity could be 10 years out. Like it's
 
Equity could be 10 years out. Like it's
very difficult around that end. Second
 
very difficult around that end. Second
of all, valuations are always changing
 
of all, valuations are always changing
and differing. So the the dollar value
 
and differing. So the the dollar value
is fluctuating. There's so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
is fluctuating. There's so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
plates spinning with this Nolan. I don't
 
plates spinning with this Nolan. I don't
even know how I do my day job.
 
even know how I do my day job.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we did it. Um,
 
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we did it. Um,
&gt;&gt; now what? I want to go back in house.
 
&gt;&gt; now what? I want to go back in house.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, ex Well, I'm tell I've I just on
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, ex Well, I'm tell I've I just on
this topic I have run the experiment. I
 
this topic I have run the experiment. I
ultimately think we made the right
 
ultimately think we made the right
decision.
 
decision.
But the learning is is that, you know,
 
But the learning is is that, you know,
so we had offices across the globe. I
 
so we had offices across the globe. I
think we had nine by the time that I
 
think we had nine by the time that I
left. And the learning is employees
 
left. And the learning is employees
talk.
 
talk.
And so we were clear about this like we
 
And so we were clear about this like we
did an all hands. We told people how we
 
did an all hands. We told people how we
were going to do it. But typically when
 
were going to do it. But typically when
you do the all hands you're not saying
 
you do the all hands you're not saying
like oh like the cost of labor
 
like oh like the cost of labor
adjustment for SF to this mark like
 
adjustment for SF to this mark like
you're not going to share that
 
you're not going to share that
information. Nobody shares that
 
information. Nobody shares that
information. Like it's just not
 
information. Like it's just not
relevant. In fact I think it's
 
relevant. In fact I think it's
distracting. But employees talk and they
 
distracting. But employees talk and they
find out and they get pissed when they
 
find out and they get pissed when they
find out that somebody who is working
 
find out that somebody who is working
just because they live in San Francisco
 
just because they live in San Francisco
to where they're at the same level is
 
to where they're at the same level is
now making significantly more in equity
 
now making significantly more in equity
than they are. And look, I mean, so
 
than they are. And look, I mean, so
again, we I've run the experiment. I've
 
again, we I've run the experiment. I've
played it out. I think we did it the
 
played it out. I think we did it the
right way. I think we communicated it
 
right way. I think we communicated it
well. The black pill situation here for
 
well. The black pill situation here for
me is like, man, it's a lot of work and
 
me is like, man, it's a lot of work and
ultimately everyone's still going to
 
ultimately everyone's still going to
hate you. So, yeah, do you want to give
 
hate you. So, yeah, do you want to give
equity to everybody? Cool. Like, it
 
equity to everybody? Cool. Like, it
sounds like really nice to do, but then
 
sounds like really nice to do, but then
when you get into the click-in and you
 
when you get into the click-in and you
start to figure it out and then you go
 
start to figure it out and then you go
do it and you like
 
do it and you like
&gt;&gt; you like spend all of your political
 
&gt;&gt; you like spend all of your political
capital with the board and convince them
 
capital with the board and convince them
to take delution
 
to take delution
&gt;&gt; and then the employees hate you and the
 
&gt;&gt; and then the employees hate you and the
board hates you.
 
board hates you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you're and now you have more work.
 
&gt;&gt; And you're and now you have more work.
Why did you do this again?
 
Why did you do this again?
&gt;&gt; Everybody, if you're not watching this,
 
&gt;&gt; Everybody, if you're not watching this,
which most probably aren't, like the
 
which most probably aren't, like the
sinister little smile that Nolan just
 
sinister little smile that Nolan just
had when he said that was incredible.
 
had when he said that was incredible.
And everybody just hates you. I just I
 
And everybody just hates you. I just I
don't know. I'd love for you to
 
don't know. I'd love for you to
disagree. I do not think the juice is
 
disagree. I do not think the juice is
worth the squeeze on that one at all
 
worth the squeeze on that one at all
&gt;&gt; on the labor adjustment
 
&gt;&gt; on the labor adjustment
&gt;&gt; for equity.
 
&gt;&gt; for equity.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So then if you do that, you have
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So then if you do that, you have
to go tell the board that we are not
 
to go tell the board that we are not
doing cost of labor adjustments for
 
doing cost of labor adjustments for
equity
 
equity
&gt;&gt; and the board is going to, you know,
 
&gt;&gt; and the board is going to, you know,
with a proctologology exam go up your
 
with a proctologology exam go up your
ass and around the corner and be like,
 
ass and around the corner and be like,
really, Kelly? So we should take more
 
really, Kelly? So we should take more
dilution because you don't think, well,
 
dilution because you don't think, well,
why do you do this for cash then, Kelly?
 
why do you do this for cash then, Kelly?
&gt;&gt; I understand. I mean, all all the points
 
&gt;&gt; I understand. I mean, all all the points
I mentioned earlier, I would polish up
 
I mentioned earlier, I would polish up
very crisply and explain those points.
 
very crisply and explain those points.
Um, but ultimately everything I try to
 
Um, but ultimately everything I try to
do with boards and I am empathetic to
 
do with boards and I am empathetic to
that. Maybe not empathetic, but I
 
that. Maybe not empathetic, but I
understand that it's a business and I
 
understand that it's a business and I
think sometimes we all forget that we
 
think sometimes we all forget that we
have investors that we have to answer
 
have investors that we have to answer
to. We do not work for nonprofits and I
 
to. We do not work for nonprofits and I
think a lot of people will forget that
 
think a lot of people will forget that
if you choose to. So I understand the
 
if you choose to. So I understand the
tension there for me. And you you can't
 
tension there for me. And you you can't
do this in an argumentative or a
 
do this in an argumentative or a
combative way, which is always the
 
combative way, which is always the
trick. It always distills down to
 
trick. It always distills down to
if you want a billion plus dollar
 
if you want a billion plus dollar
company, you have to get great talent
 
company, you have to get great talent
that wants to be here and wants to work
 
that wants to be here and wants to work
their ass off. And that does not happen
 
their ass off. And that does not happen
if you are cheap. And that is always the
 
if you are cheap. And that is always the
tension for me is you want your cake and
 
tension for me is you want your cake and
you want to eat it too. You want great
 
you want to eat it too. You want great
people, but you don't want too many and
 
people, but you don't want too many and
you don't want to pay them too much.
 
you don't want to pay them too much.
Like you kind of get what you pay for a
 
Like you kind of get what you pay for a
little bit. And I just don't think
 
little bit. And I just don't think
you're going to attract the best talent
 
you're going to attract the best talent
by spinning your wheels, splitting hairs
 
by spinning your wheels, splitting hairs
over this stuff.
 
over this stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I tend to agree. I think that's
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I tend to agree. I think that's
for sure true in San Francisco and New
 
for sure true in San Francisco and New
York. I don't think it's true
 
York. I don't think it's true
&gt;&gt; in almost every other market in the
 
&gt;&gt; in almost every other market in the
United States, and it's definitely not
 
United States, and it's definitely not
true
 
true
&gt;&gt; internationally. Now, having said that,
 
&gt;&gt; internationally. Now, having said that,
it's the right thing to do. Like it is
 
it's the right thing to do. Like it is
morally the right thing to do is if you
 
morally the right thing to do is if you
give out equity to the majority of your
 
give out equity to the majority of your
employees, you should give out equity to
 
employees, you should give out equity to
all of your employees. You just have to
 
all of your employees. You just have to
be willing like my grandpa used to say
 
be willing like my grandpa used to say
this. He's like, "No, there's always a
 
this. He's like, "No, there's always a
tax." And so you have to be willing to
 
tax." And so you have to be willing to
pay the tax on this one, which is a
 
pay the tax on this one, which is a
little bit more work, a lot more
 
little bit more work, a lot more
explanation. People are always going to
 
explanation. People are always going to
be mad about it. But if you can do the
 
be mad about it. But if you can do the
compare and contrast, show the T-chart
 
compare and contrast, show the T-chart
of your company versus other companies
 
of your company versus other companies
or the role that you're offering versus
 
or the role that you're offering versus
like what other companies are doing, I
 
like what other companies are doing, I
think you can tell the story. And just
 
think you can tell the story. And just
to put a bow on the the conversation
 
to put a bow on the the conversation
with I reflect back a lot on my career,
 
with I reflect back a lot on my career,
like where have I learned the most? And
 
like where have I learned the most? And
that hour with was like it was maybe the
 
that hour with was like it was maybe the
most important conversation I've had
 
most important conversation I've had
because it made me think so much more
 
because it made me think so much more
broadly about this topic and more
 
broadly about this topic and more
intentionally and about the different
 
intentionally and about the different
stakeholders, how I insert myself in
 
stakeholders, how I insert myself in
that process, how we communicate to
 
that process, how we communicate to
everybody involved. And so all I would
 
everybody involved. And so all I would
say is I think if you get into this
 
say is I think if you get into this
stuff, make sure you have an expert
 
stuff, make sure you have an expert
that's helping you out and helping you
 
that's helping you out and helping you
navigate things and helping you think
 
navigate things and helping you think
through stuff. Um, and you think very
 
through stuff. Um, and you think very
critically about the second and third
 
critically about the second and third
order consequences of which there will
 
order consequences of which there will
be regardless of the choice you make.
 
be regardless of the choice you make.
&gt;&gt; Great name, by the way. I'm assuming
 
&gt;&gt; Great name, by the way. I'm assuming
that's a fake name you made up for the
 
that's a fake name you made up for the
story. is a legend and I'm so grateful
 
story. is a legend and I'm so grateful
like for that conversation and for him
 
like for that conversation and for him
helping educate me
 
helping educate me
&gt;&gt; given that he's done this was I mean
 
&gt;&gt; given that he's done this was I mean
they invested in he was on the board
 
they invested in he was on the board
like
 
like
&gt;&gt; he he has seen everything and so again
 
&gt;&gt; he he has seen everything and so again
our outcome
 
our outcome
I think was is the right play it is the
 
I think was is the right play it is the
right decision but there's a lot that
 
right decision but there's a lot that
goes into it and just because it was our
 
goes into it and just because it was our
right decision doesn't mean it's the
 
right decision doesn't mean it's the
right decision for you your CEO or your
 
right decision for you your CEO or your
board
 
board
Uh yes, my closing thought, two closing
 
Uh yes, my closing thought, two closing
thoughts. One, I I just want to accent
 
thoughts. One, I I just want to accent
this. Do not do this alone. Do not go
 
this. Do not do this alone. Do not go
through this alone. Hire an external
 
through this alone. Hire an external
firm. Hire a consultant. You try hire
 
firm. Hire a consultant. You try hire
some kind of wing person to help you
 
some kind of wing person to help you
through this because when push comes to
 
through this because when push comes to
shove and you're kind of managing that
 
shove and you're kind of managing that
tension with the board or the comp
 
tension with the board or the comp
committee, having that neutral third
 
committee, having that neutral third
party there is really important. The
 
party there is really important. The
other thing I would say is going back to
 
other thing I would say is going back to
like adjusting for geo we talked about
 
like adjusting for geo we talked about
right that was on the assumption that
 
right that was on the assumption that
you have multiple geos in tier one and
 
you have multiple geos in tier one and
tier 2 cities right mixed
 
tier 2 cities right mixed
&gt;&gt; if I was like fullon only in Salt Lake I
 
&gt;&gt; if I was like fullon only in Salt Lake I
would totally reduce it
 
would totally reduce it
because there's nothing to compare it
 
because there's nothing to compare it
to.
 
to.
So just think about that if you're
 
So just think about that if you're
starting a company or selecting geos or
 
starting a company or selecting geos or
planning how you're going to grow the
 
planning how you're going to grow the
workforce like pick consistent locations
 
workforce like pick consistent locations
then you can equally bring it down and
 
then you can equally bring it down and
not have a bunch of drama.
 
not have a bunch of drama.
&gt;&gt; Last thing for me is always expect
 
&gt;&gt; Last thing for me is always expect
people to find out whatever the
 
people to find out whatever the
underlying principles and even the math
 
underlying principles and even the math
of your program is. And so the main
 
of your program is. And so the main
thing here is like you need to
 
thing here is like you need to
communicate as much as possible and also
 
communicate as much as possible and also
if you know an Excel spreadsheet gets
 
if you know an Excel spreadsheet gets
leaked one day and it ends up on the
 
leaked one day and it ends up on the
front page of the New York Times, you
 
front page of the New York Times, you
are able to explain why you made those
 
are able to explain why you made those
decisions of which like I am very proud
 
decisions of which like I am very proud
of the program that that we built. So if
 
of the program that that we built. So if
anyone has questions on this stuff, I
 
anyone has questions on this stuff, I
have certainly done a lot of this work.
 
have certainly done a lot of this work.
But you know, happy giving equity, do
