# Why Giving Stock to Everyone Is Harder Than It Sound

## Transcript

 
Hey everyone, how's it going? Happy
Monday, Nolan. We are back for another
segment of Dear Heretics. If you
remember, I'm in a good mood today. This
was the knockoff from Dear Abby, right?
The newspaper paper column of advice.
And I got one last week, Nolan. I think
it's a really good one. You you reacted
to it today. You're like, we got to do
this. So, this will be good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. First of all, Monday, what's up
with you? What's happening,
&gt;&gt; dude? Great weekend. I mean, well,
Niners lost yesterday, so I'm pretty
miserable if I'm being really honest
with you today. But as I was telling
you, it's like I'm doing these exact
searches and we're kicking ass, man. I
mean, it's essentially just me. I'm
having so much fun. The thing I I just
told the friend about this, Kelly, it's
like being in my zone of genius,
&gt;&gt; it turns out, is fun.
&gt;&gt; And so, I'm having a blast.
&gt;&gt; It's kind of cool. I mean, it sounds
like kind of what I was talking about.
uh was actually on the People
Accelerator podcast and talking about
how you kind of come back to what you
you love and what you're good at and
usually those things
&gt;&gt; usually hopefully they they equal. But
yeah, the nighter sucked. I bet the
under which also sucked
&gt;&gt; really. Yeah. Okay, everyone. Well, hope
you're all doing good out there. Um got
a question last week and I talked to my
friend about it. Thought I'd put it on
Dear Heretics because she asked me a
question about stock options. And the
question Nolan specifically was, "Hey,
well, specifically was, "Hey pal, I'm
talking to my CEO and we're kind of
arguing over whether everyone should get
stock options or only certain levels."
Like they don't want to give SDRs, for
example, stock options. What do you
think? Would love your advice.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, you know, I worked at
Carta and uh our goal at Carta was to
make everyone an owner. And one of the
hypotheses around the software was if we
made it easier for companies to issue
equity, then more companies would issue
equity because it's kind of a pain in
the ass if you have to like hit up your
lawyer and it's like paper certificates
and stuff. So, the story I used to tell
candidates, which is true, is like my
dad has been in sales his entire life.
Um, and specifically in sales, and you
still see this in tech companies, like
back in the day, they never got equity.
And even still today, most of them
don't. And I feel like if you're
transactional
in your relationship with employees, so
like, hey, this is the number, this is
your quota, go hit this thing. You think
on short time horizons and you make
decisions on short time horizons. Uh,
utopia for me is everybody is an owner.
Now to take the other side of that,
objectively investors hate it. And I
learned this um it turns out like
investors make their money by not
getting diluted. And the more equity you
issue, the more dilution investors take
and they don't like it. They want to get
rich. They want to get their LPs rich.
It's it's their business model. It's
not, you know, terrible black ball
capitalism sort of a thing. It's just
the way that their business model works.
And so the more equity they give away,
the more delution they take, the less
money they make. And so I would just say
my advice generally high level to this
person is you need to come up with the
ethos what matters to you and your
company. And the only way you can do
that is with your CEO. What's your take
on this, Kelly? Yeah, I had and I told
her I said, "Look, I have a really
strong opinion on this and it's to give
ownership of the company to everyone
working their ass off to make it
successful." Um, I think it's just a
just from an e immoral standpoint. You
know, it just feels
strange to me. Um, the other reason is,
I mean, I I still to this day I don't
like doing things or asking other people
to do things or expect stuff from them
that I wouldn't do myself. And I just
think it it creates just some kind of an
equality of like one team. Um, that's
just kind of my utopian view, Nolan. I
think the defensive kind of like view is
it's a huge it's a huge headache. not if
when that AMA will be asked around why
you don't give options to everybody and
that's going to suck because no matter
what answer you give
it's going to linger in the air of your
culture and I truly believe that
I think also from a competitive
standpoint I've been doing venture you
know public companies before But I've
been doing venture for 16 years, I have
never worked for a company that didn't
offer it to everyone. So I think if
you're trying to be an ace company with
great talent and a great brand and
reputation, I don't know how you acquire
and keep that talent if you're not
offering this ownership to everybody.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I've never told this story
publicly, but um I think I can tell a
sanitized version of it. Um so
&gt;&gt; I hear you say that a lot on your
podcast. Like what do you have a rolodex
of like secret stories you just pull?
&gt;&gt; I Well, you got to be really thoughtful.
You got to be really thoughtful about
private information, private
conversations,
&gt;&gt; uh, and make especially when you're
talking about other people.
&gt;&gt; So, this story I think I can I can tell
a sanitized version. So, basically,
&gt;&gt; when we were at Carta, one of the things
Henry wanted to do is he wanted to do an
employee refresh. And so anyways, the
long and the short of this is one of
Carta's investors is and
uh he writes a blog called it's like
it's legendary in Silicon Valley is
probably the most
like sorry maybe not the most the
smartest person on equity I've ever met
and I've met a ton of these people met a
ton of comp people met a ton of VCs is
like the top of the food chain. So we go
to and he started asking me questions I
had never considered. One of which was
Nolan, do you think employees will care
about this after the initial grant?
And here's the thing, Kelly, I think we
get a little bit in the ivory tower on,
you know, you and I have been in San
Francisco, Silicon Valley working with
tech companies, highle roles. I've had a
bunch of people have big outcomes in our
circles. It's like we know the game.
If you're building, for example, a sales
office in Salt Lake,
those employees don't know the game. And
so if you're giving out equity, what you
would expect in return is people
playing, like I said earlier, this
longer game, making decisions on a
longer time horizon. But if employees
don't understand it, then you're not
going to get that outcome. And so, what
are you going to do? How are you going
to educate people on this? So giving out
equity actually also creates headaches
for you because just giving it out is
not a panacea. What do you think about
that?
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a great point and I will agree
that not everyone understands this and I
will argue all day long that is not a
reason not to give it to be like oh well
they don't they don't know that anyway
so screw them. We're not we're not going
to give it to them because I do believe
that one day that will come back to bite
you. It's kind of like it's kind of like
the hourly thing like you know we're not
going to make them hourly whatever their
base and then and then a year later
they're hourly and they're like wait you
owe us all this overtime what the hell
was going on you were screwing me like
it's kind of like that I I do think I do
think that that strategy is just kind of
sleazy. I mean, if you're not going to
do it, be open about it and make sure
you can explain why in front of a whole
company. Fine. Clarity of identity and
take your pros and cons for each. But
just kind of like sweep it under the rug
because you don't think they know that
will come back. The other thing is
also, I do believe this, if you're going
to give out equity to everybody,
it is more valuable and useful to you if
you actually tell them
how it works and show them upside
scenarios again with asterisks that say
monopoly money. But like at Pendo, we
did a bunch of round tables with our CFO
and myself and we talked all about
equity and how it works and upside
scenarios. And you know what? People got
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fired up. Like they were like
working hard. They were excited. It
raised moods. It impacted the culture.
Like all that stuff snowballs, but you
have to actually put some work into it,
too. So,
&gt;&gt; okay. Where we're aligned for sure is if
you give equity out, you must educate
employees on how it works. The thing
that Carta did that was from Henry, this
is in his better offer letter blog post,
Henry said in the offer letter, "The
default value you should assign to your
equity is $0. Act like you're never
getting anything. Live like you're never
getting anything. Never plan on it." And
I always thought that that was such a
great like floor for the expectation
setting for people because when you do
talk about scenarios, all of a sudden
people start counting in their head and
in their bank accounts money they have
not received. So I think that's super
super important. But regardless both you
and I agree there is work that goes into
teaching people about this. And that
work by the way is never done. It's not
like a we did a one-time AMA on equity
and now it's over. It's like a you got
to talk about this thing like every six
months and remind people what it is.
Teach them how it works so it becomes
this neverending body of work and
employees will always have questions
about it. Okay, that's that piece.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our AI change
is how work gets done. Recruiting is no
exception. Meta View is the AI platform
purpose-built for recruiting. If you're
looking to level up your AI adoption and
see real impact from intake to offer,
it's a no-brainer. Metiv's suite of AI
agents works for you at every stage of
the hiring process. Their platform
powers instant job postc creation, AI
powered candidate Q&amp;A, insights on
pipeline performance, compensation, and
so much more. I've seen firsthand how
tough it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in candidate
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metiv changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Metaview. Just head over to

experts or get started for free. You'll
be up running an AI enabled in minutes.
The second piece, going back to my
conversation with
he said, Nolan, how do you plan on
accounting for cost of labor
differences
in different locations with equity?
And that was like a oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I've I
was like I had not thought about it. We
like we have to go think about this now.
What the first question is is like do
you do that? So, what's your philosophy
on different locations and cost of
labor? Most companies will adjust
cash compensation depending on the
location of the employee because cost of
labor is different in different markets.
Most companies don't think about that
for equity or they don't have any
structure around it. Most famously, like
Google up until recently basically gave
everybody Google equity as if you were
in San Francisco. I believe that's since
changed. So, what's [clears throat] your
take on that, Kelly? Would you do a cost
of labor adjustment on it?
&gt;&gt; That is a whole can of worms.
&gt;&gt; I know.
&gt;&gt; I mean that that my brain just like went
light speed through like that all of
that and I'm like exhausted now. So
theoretically I've never I've never done
it. I've never adjusted equity for geo.
Right. If we just take it on its face,
theoretically,
you probably should because
most companies now, I I do, we look at
equity based on dollar value, not just
like a random stock unit number. You
actually look at dollar values. So on
that end, you should do it.
On the other end, I'm just going to be
kind of negative Nelly here for a
minute. Can you imagine all of the
administrative's
chaos? Not even chaos, mindnumbing
shitow when employees start to complain
and move and well you gave me this and
now I moved and so now I need more or
this person now you got to reduce their
equity like
&gt;&gt; driving my life. I
&gt;&gt; that is insane. And the second piece of
it, Nolan, two other factors that make
my brain hurt. One, the long-term nature
of equity, right? Cash, cost of labor,
you're using it now. House, mortgage,
food in that area, whatever it is.
Equity could be 10 years out. Like it's
very difficult around that end. Second
of all, valuations are always changing
and differing. So the the dollar value
is fluctuating. There's so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
plates spinning with this Nolan. I don't
even know how I do my day job.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we did it. Um,
&gt;&gt; now what? I want to go back in house.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, ex Well, I'm tell I've I just on
this topic I have run the experiment. I
ultimately think we made the right
decision.
But the learning is is that, you know,
so we had offices across the globe. I
think we had nine by the time that I
left. And the learning is employees
talk.
And so we were clear about this like we
did an all hands. We told people how we
were going to do it. But typically when
you do the all hands you're not saying
like oh like the cost of labor
adjustment for SF to this mark like
you're not going to share that
information. Nobody shares that
information. Like it's just not
relevant. In fact I think it's
distracting. But employees talk and they
find out and they get pissed when they
find out that somebody who is working
just because they live in San Francisco
to where they're at the same level is
now making significantly more in equity
than they are. And look, I mean, so
again, we I've run the experiment. I've
played it out. I think we did it the
right way. I think we communicated it
well. The black pill situation here for
me is like, man, it's a lot of work and
ultimately everyone's still going to
hate you. So, yeah, do you want to give
equity to everybody? Cool. Like, it
sounds like really nice to do, but then
when you get into the click-in and you
start to figure it out and then you go
do it and you like
&gt;&gt; you like spend all of your political
capital with the board and convince them
to take delution
&gt;&gt; and then the employees hate you and the
board hates you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you're and now you have more work.
Why did you do this again?
&gt;&gt; Everybody, if you're not watching this,
which most probably aren't, like the
sinister little smile that Nolan just
had when he said that was incredible.
And everybody just hates you. I just I
don't know. I'd love for you to
disagree. I do not think the juice is
worth the squeeze on that one at all
&gt;&gt; on the labor adjustment
&gt;&gt; for equity.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So then if you do that, you have
to go tell the board that we are not
doing cost of labor adjustments for
equity
&gt;&gt; and the board is going to, you know,
with a proctologology exam go up your
ass and around the corner and be like,
really, Kelly? So we should take more
dilution because you don't think, well,
why do you do this for cash then, Kelly?
&gt;&gt; I understand. I mean, all all the points
I mentioned earlier, I would polish up
very crisply and explain those points.
Um, but ultimately everything I try to
do with boards and I am empathetic to
that. Maybe not empathetic, but I
understand that it's a business and I
think sometimes we all forget that we
have investors that we have to answer
to. We do not work for nonprofits and I
think a lot of people will forget that
if you choose to. So I understand the
tension there for me. And you you can't
do this in an argumentative or a
combative way, which is always the
trick. It always distills down to
if you want a billion plus dollar
company, you have to get great talent
that wants to be here and wants to work
their ass off. And that does not happen
if you are cheap. And that is always the
tension for me is you want your cake and
you want to eat it too. You want great
people, but you don't want too many and
you don't want to pay them too much.
Like you kind of get what you pay for a
little bit. And I just don't think
you're going to attract the best talent
by spinning your wheels, splitting hairs
over this stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I tend to agree. I think that's
for sure true in San Francisco and New
York. I don't think it's true
&gt;&gt; in almost every other market in the
United States, and it's definitely not
true
&gt;&gt; internationally. Now, having said that,
it's the right thing to do. Like it is
morally the right thing to do is if you
give out equity to the majority of your
employees, you should give out equity to
all of your employees. You just have to
be willing like my grandpa used to say
this. He's like, "No, there's always a
tax." And so you have to be willing to
pay the tax on this one, which is a
little bit more work, a lot more
explanation. People are always going to
be mad about it. But if you can do the
compare and contrast, show the T-chart
of your company versus other companies
or the role that you're offering versus
like what other companies are doing, I
think you can tell the story. And just
to put a bow on the the conversation
with I reflect back a lot on my career,
like where have I learned the most? And
that hour with was like it was maybe the
most important conversation I've had
because it made me think so much more
broadly about this topic and more
intentionally and about the different
stakeholders, how I insert myself in
that process, how we communicate to
everybody involved. And so all I would
say is I think if you get into this
stuff, make sure you have an expert
that's helping you out and helping you
navigate things and helping you think
through stuff. Um, and you think very
critically about the second and third
order consequences of which there will
be regardless of the choice you make.
&gt;&gt; Great name, by the way. I'm assuming
that's a fake name you made up for the
story. is a legend and I'm so grateful
like for that conversation and for him
helping educate me
&gt;&gt; given that he's done this was I mean
they invested in he was on the board
like
&gt;&gt; he he has seen everything and so again
our outcome
I think was is the right play it is the
right decision but there's a lot that
goes into it and just because it was our
right decision doesn't mean it's the
right decision for you your CEO or your
board
Uh yes, my closing thought, two closing
thoughts. One, I I just want to accent
this. Do not do this alone. Do not go
through this alone. Hire an external
firm. Hire a consultant. You try hire
some kind of wing person to help you
through this because when push comes to
shove and you're kind of managing that
tension with the board or the comp
committee, having that neutral third
party there is really important. The
other thing I would say is going back to
like adjusting for geo we talked about
right that was on the assumption that
you have multiple geos in tier one and
tier 2 cities right mixed
&gt;&gt; if I was like fullon only in Salt Lake I
would totally reduce it
because there's nothing to compare it
to.
So just think about that if you're
starting a company or selecting geos or
planning how you're going to grow the
workforce like pick consistent locations
then you can equally bring it down and
not have a bunch of drama.
&gt;&gt; Last thing for me is always expect
people to find out whatever the
underlying principles and even the math
of your program is. And so the main
thing here is like you need to
communicate as much as possible and also
if you know an Excel spreadsheet gets
leaked one day and it ends up on the
front page of the New York Times, you
are able to explain why you made those
decisions of which like I am very proud
of the program that that we built. So if
anyone has questions on this stuff, I
have certainly done a lot of this work.
But you know, happy giving equity, do
it. You should you should do it in all
in all honesty. You really should do it,
but just be prepared.
All right, everyone. Another another
great segment here of Dear Heretics.
Keep them coming, everyone. See you
later.
