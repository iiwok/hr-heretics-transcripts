what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics Valentina
welcome to the show so great to be here
I'm excited for a spicy chat well let's
get right into that and I will actually
start with saying Kelly's not here it's
 
until about 99 she did confirm this so
all we can assume is that Kelly's asleep
and I will roast her all day long for
missing this conversation so thanks
again for showing up even if it's just
for me I appreciate it and I'm happy to
show up just for you love it okay so you
were at Bridgewater for five years I
have been a Bridgewater Fanboy at least
from AF far I've read principles I've
read all the crazy things that Ry does
and what I find most interesting about
that c culture is it's highly
experimental with people operations so
some radical things that they did at
Bridgewater as I read in principles is
like record every meeting like literally
of every single meeting in the company
they rate team members performance
during meetings I think Ray called it
like the dot collector tell us about
your time at Bridgewater and about some
of these experiments and what it was
actually like living those yeah so I'll
just say like there are many things that
Bridgewater did excellently from a
people experiments perspective and and
many things that were not so excellent
I'll just say at the highest level
before I get into kind of the tactics I
think the from a people experiment
perspective I think Bridgewater really
pioneered an audaciously high bar for
talent which is something that I've
taken away and believe is like that
that's a principle I will always go by
especially for leaders cander is not an
option that's not bridgew that's no
those aren't Ray's words those are mine
but like I don't believe you can choose
to have a culture that's not candid and
still have high performance and finally
like get once you have all these big
talents you have to give them autonomy
and let them run a business whatever
that business is if that business is TA
that's their business with their kpis
and they're running it autonomously and
so I think Bridgewater did those things
excellently and had some really great
people philosophies that drove that
those same people philosophies or or
similar ones also drove a lot of
interesting practices some of which were
great and some of which were not as
great and so talking about for example
the dot collector specifically the dot
collector was founded on both great
management people Ops thinking and I
think flawed management people Ops
thinking so we did in fact in every
meeting and at the end of every day rate
people on their performance across a a
set of 120 attributes it started off as
thumbs up thumbs down with a thoughtful
feedback and then it became a scale of 1
to 10 with a thoughtful feedback now
that I actually think is a good tool if
like particularly if it were based on
competencies it wasn't it was based on
attributes so I'll talk about that in a
minute but imagine you had a tool where
like you had your competency grid and
there are tools like this and like in
relatively real time you could be like
hey Valentina in this meeting I thought
that you shined or fell short on the
competency of team design because your
org structure that you described didn't
make a lot of sense and here's the
feedback that I would have for you and
the advice I would have for you totally
stand behind that I think that's great
and I really enjoyed that aspect of dots
and that's all based on the principles
of feedback and
transparency there there was another
principle of systemized management where
the idea was you take all of this data
and you use it to paint a pointal listic
picture of people over time and over
that you apply Ai and you use all of
that to not substitute but significantly
augment human judgment in terms of
putting people into roles who should be
like elevated who doesn't have what it
takes and so I think that's where like
that doesn't work for a couple of
reasons one it's all based on an
inherently flawed system where like we
weren't rating people on competencies we
were rating them on 120 attributes that
are kind of fixed so it wasn't like hey
Valentina let me help you get better it
was hey Valentina I'm going to tell you
where I think your logical thinking is
this is how good of a logical thinker I
think you are and so it was like these
fixed attributes and inherently there's
so much bias in that right especially in
a company that is preponderantly led by
white men and so if you take this system
where all the data has this inherent
bias in it and then you use it to help
manage people you are creating something
that is fundamentally very flawed
interesting okay so I I want to go back
to dot collector and then I want to come
back to what you just said so for DOT
collector what was the experience like
receiving that so again as I understand
it I have not seen this tool I know a
couple only a couple of companies to my
understanding have actually toyed around
with the dog collector once once it was
productized but you get feedback in a
meeting and then you get feedback at the
end of the day like what does it look
like you so you open the thing up and
what it like when do you open that thing
up and what are you reading and what is
that like yeah so it it's kind of mind
bog imagine you know that moment in
reviews
and you're opening your 360 feedback and
you're like oh my God what are people
going saying about me every minute of
every day so you become a little
desensitized to it on the plus side and
then there's a benefit to it of course
like that 360 feedback is Rich and it's
you know it gives you all of this stuff
to process and think about and change
now the question is how much can you
change how much feedback can you process
in a given day and so yeah like at the
end of the day you know if I had had a
public day where I was leading a lot of
meeting
I would sit down and be like all right I
got 25 dots let's see where I'm at and
you would read like thoughtful feedbacks
from people saying things like you know
thumbs up Valentina you visualized that
meeting really well and drove it through
to results and all the way to like
thumbs down on conceptual thinking from
Rey and then you're like oh well now I
will be an idiot in the system for all
time wow okay but you record the
meetings and so actually like I have to
ask this question first which is is
there like a DOT collector God so like a
like an Overlord that sees like all the
dots to make sure that the feedback is
actually like thoughtful and
constructive and specific that is a good
question I don't know what the answer to
that is now but I do know that everyone
can see everyone else's dots and I did
see wow dotting on dots so people would
dot other people's dots and be like hey
your dot was not very helpful or like
your dot was too aggressive and then
people would get Wars okay that's very
meta and very interesting okay so let's
let's talk about this what you just said
around bias and so let me just play it
back that I have it correct which is the
AI tool to put people into roles was
highly weighted by people who were
already in senior positions thus those
people looked you know mostly white
mostly men and because that was the case
right that that system was inherently
biased do I have that right right I
would say so and you know I think you
know now they have a superwoman at the
helm and things may be radically
different I've been gone for a long time
but yeah that is a fair characterization
of of looking backwards how I would
describe the attempt to systemize
management got it okay super helpful and
then why don't more people take like the
best of what worked from there because
again I my take on Bridgewater is they
feel like they're on The Cutting Edge of
people experimentation Ray talks about
this all the time so it none of this
stuff is like State Secrets like he
actually wants to put it in the world
which I think is is good for Bridgewater
and good for his brand why do you think
people aren't doing
this because it's hard you know I would
ask how many leaders have principles on
their shelves I would say most most or
at least more than 50% and then how many
are actually applying the practice and
how many read it and were like oh my God
I feel like I'm discovering a truth you
know this is so the way I think yes
right and then they don't implement it
because it's really really hard and
that's my short answer yeah it makes it
makes total sense right like getting to
that level of clarity of what actually
matters it sounds very easy but the
reality is is that like you don't just
do it overnight it's not like a hey like
let's go lock ourselves in a conference
room and come up with company values
every time I've done this it's been like
a monthlong process there's so much like
churn and and going through the ideas
then you get something you're like I'm
like 70% happy with it then it iterates
like 12 times over the course of the
next like year and a half and then
people are like it's like like not
close enough like I don't know what we
want to do with this let's start again
exactly yeah exactly okay so now you're
a Garner and Garner is serious c 200
people you guys are projecting to double
Year over-year
many tech companies are pushing
employees back to the office but you
guys are committed to making remote work
permanent why is that the case well I
would say we're hybrid so by hybrid
meaning some in office employees some
fully remote employees and we are
committed to making that per permanent
and I would say the same thing not or a
similar thing to what I said about why
people don't do
principles is the same reason why people
are bringing folks in office because
it's easier a lot of things are easier
to do in office um and in order to get
that ease the tradeoff is you have a
narrower talent pool and almost by
definition you will have worst talent in
your company and Garner is not willing
to trade off the obvious bad outcome in
exchange for doing the easier thing like
I would rather think through how to do
culture and employee experience
excellently and I don't worry about
productivity I I our people are very
productive but specifically culture and
employee experience excellently in a
remote environment I will take that
difficult tradeoff and like solve the
future of work eventually God willing
then take a obvious bad
outcome it you know it's such an honest
answer that I appreciate because the
reality of successful companies is all
of them go some form of hybrid
eventually whether that's a second HQ
whether that's we have some remote
employees whether that's like you know
coinbase we just go fully remote and I I
appreciate the the earnestness because
it is true that it is easier to manage
in person and that's kind of just like
that well like let's just not deal with
this right now but you're going to
deal with it eventually if you are
successful and it appears that you guys
are on that path so what are you doing
to make hybrid successful especially
given that what many people say about
hybrid is it's the worst of all
worlds yeah well the good I mean what
we're not doing I think I think yes
hybrid is very difficult I think when H
some people say hybrid is the worst of
all World they are talking about the
mandatory hybrid policies but leading a
team that is partly remote and partly in
person is very difficult so I'll say a
few things one we appreciate the need
for in-person connection like we have an
we have a bespoke culture where we
expect people to give us the best work
of their lives put the mission ahead of
self-interest give and receive honesty
and we understand that you can't do that
without a deep reservoir of trust and so
we both in the system and in the people
so we invest very heavily in in-person
time while people still get to live and
work wherever they want but we bring
every remote employee gets at least
three in-person touch points a year two
of them will involve seeing the CEO most
likely and so that's something we invest
heavily in and then like you know lots
of ways for people to spend time in
person is one piece of it the other
piece of it is actually identifying what
is the difference what are the moments
that matter what is the what the when
the how that makes inperson culture
inperson employee experience better than
remote and identifying those moments and
then teaching leaders how to deal with
remote employees or hybrid teams in
those
moments it's it's really interesting so
three times a year we get together and
and so I'm I'm assuming what that means
is there's probably like one big company
retreat thing and then there's like
potentially you know multiple moments
specifically with the team and cross
functional team that you're building
with with with whatever thing you're
working on is that right
exactly the thing that's underneath that
is a lot of people go remote for the
Arbitrage that you don't have to have an
office and so that makes it cheaper and
actually I think what you guys are doing
potentially might even be more expensive
absolutely that's not why we're remote
we are all about Excellence I mean yes
efficiency matters as well but no we're
happy to pay real estate costs if our
great New York Talent or in the future
maybe our great Silicon Valley Talent
wants to be in the
office we'll give them that and if our
great like Utah Talent can join Garner
we want them yeah that makes total sense
to me do you guys keep it right now to
the continental US or are you guys truly
remote in the sense that like we're
looking Global we have Global
employees okay I find that the time zone
is insanely hard and you know when
you're building especially software and
people are you know trying to move very
quickly you have these very large gaps
of when you can get information that if
you just had like you know walking over
to somebody at the water cooler you'd be
able to move faster I find that remote
fully remote Global is hard from a
synchronous standpoint so for example if
I'm in California and I'm a product
manager working with software engineers
in New York York and then even overseas
which is even more
challenging it's very difficult to
actually get things done and to move
quickly how do you all defend against
that yeah so we've been pretty strategic
in terms of what we hire abroad in that
we build kind of distinct pods we have a
distinct pod for example in Hungary of
people who work closely together and
then besides that we are mostly the
Continental us and that makes it easier
because there's like six hours a day
when everyone knows they have their
synchronous time and like we use it we
have meetings we're an asynchronous
company and then you know there's
actually a benefit to people having IC
time at the book ends of the day
depending where they are and so that's
the way we manage it yeah I love the the
honesty around the benefit of IC time
like I find that I become insanely
unhappy when I don't have deep work time
and everything is just synchron this is
the the thing that drives me crazy about
only in office is like you're just
constantly interrupted and so getting
deep work done actually requires me to
be in like a different Zone than the
open Office floor plan
totally okay so the other thing I want
to ask you about is
seniority and I have a take that new
grads specifically or folks earlier in
their career have a very hard time
learning remotely and I don't think it's
impossible but I do think earlier in
your career I just reflect back on
myself and other people I've talked to I
learned a ton from osmosis I learn and
there's a lot of stuff that you just
learn by just observing that you don't
get the benefit of when you're not in
office so how do you all think about
folks earlier in their career yeah so I
think a couple things first did you
start out as a recruiter per chance I
started out as a recruiting coordinator
yeah so I think that there are some
functions that are particularly
apprenticeship driven and they are
relationship functions like sales
recruiting account management it's
really hard to just teach someone how to
have great client hands like they both
need to observe and they need to be
observed right and so we understand
those types of relationships and those
types of moments for people that are
coming up early in their career and
replicate those remotely so for example
for our new recruiters our head of ta
spends a lot of time letting them learn
from him they Shadow other recr
recruiters and then we do record a
subset of our interviews and a subset of
our meetings for training purposes which
is different from what Bridgewater did
and then Jason our head of ta will
listen to those and give advice and so
it's another one of those of like what
is the what when and how that really
mattered for those folks and how can we
replicate that
asynchronously that makes total sense I
do want to talk about the recording
Jason recording stuff so what does that
look like what is he actually doing so
when we we will occasionally record
interviews actually we record a fair
amount of interviews for training
purposes and I can get into that in a
bit part of the reason why we do that is
because we have had so much growth
people coming from all over the place
and we have this incredibly High T
Talent bar and a bespoke hiring process
and so we have two options right just
constantly be running rigorous
interviewer training which we have like
a recorded scalable training that we put
everyone through but it's not like me
constantly once a month in the room room
like really grappling with people as to
what a good interview does as to what a
good what makes a good interviewer um
and so both for the recruiters and our
interviewers we need to understand what
people are doing so that we make sure
that people are calibrated and we are
actually getting the reads we want
bringing people into the company hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment

Heretics here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work CEO is a dynamic intuitive
accessible and mobile First Tool people
actually like using it which is why
companies like ryion Aire Dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shoutouts and live streams among
other features help Elevate the employee
experience like never before the result
dramatically better retention
productivity and most importantly
connectedness a greater sense of the
belonging we all crave at work whether
we sit at a desk or drive a truck make
work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics
 
s so I want to spend more time on this
because I couldn't agree more I feel
like interview training is done poorly
everywhere and the reason why is
typically what it looks like you show up
for this hour-long session led by a
recruiter who actually doesn't know the
specifics of the job and we give these
very general principles on what we
expect interviewing to look like which
more has to do with like don't be an
 be on time pay attention to the
candidate be a good person like don't
eat don't ask them if they're pregnant
yeah yeah please like let's not get sued
that's that's like gener it's like a
interview training at most companies 101
generic off the shelf yeah totally and
then and then you get into the the
actual interview and the whole point we
forget is we want to get signal on the
candidates such that we can then start
predicting job performance yeah I think
two points right we want to get signal
and we want to give signal I I strongly
agree so how do you then Coach get
signal and give signal yeah so we are
right now implementing an interviewer
audit process or actually I've rebranded
it interviewer coaching process where
our most believable interviewers are
getting pulled to spend one to two hours
a week reviewing our people who have not
been interviewing as long and giving
them feedback specifically on those two
things did you conduct a thorough
assessment and does your scorecard
accurately reflect the candidate's
performance and then two did you deliver
a great candidate experience did you
sell Garner well did you sell yourself
well did you smile was the thing we have
to remind our interviewer sometimes and
then we basically have just a scalable
process where more and more people go
from coaches to coaches and we add more
and more people into the company and
round and round we go interesting so
it's like a little bit of like bar
raiser is but a yeah but
but at a little a little bit more
asynchronously so we can scale it
better okay when you say most believable
interviewers what does that
mean great question it is basically
interviewers that have been stamped by
some combination of me Nick and our head
of ta as already being good at those two
things okay and are you so I would
assume part of most believable actually
means like this person gets sick
on candidates and so are you guys doing
anything from like a hey we've
interviewed this person they've now
joined the company and then now we're
tying it back to like what we saw in the
interview because most companies just
stop it now they're in the company
they're either a good performer middle
of the pack or they suck and then we
don't do anything with that data as it
relates to the interview process yeah so
we absolutely are we actually very so
we're not what I would love and we are
not yet able to do because I'm I'm not I
have not yet sprung for the Tableau
addon to Greenhouse is constantly
aligning like who are our most who which
interviewers are most aligned to an
offer going out and then which
interviewers are most aligned to high
performance we're not able to do that
yet entirely but I have what I did ask
my team to do and I just got the results
of it is run an experiment based on a
hypothesis that my C CEO and I
shared that the best signal for Success
at Garner our best interview and this is
Wild is actually like a McKenzie style
first year consultant interview of for
example if you were the mayor of New
York would you outlaw Airbnb uh should
human cloning be allowed those questions
that really just test structured
critical thinking and as we analyzed all
of our Greenhouse data and compared it
to Performance and lo and behold it's
true that is the most correlated
interview to successful performance and
so now the only person who currently
does that interview is Nick and I am on
a mission to get everyone else a bunch
of other people ready to do that
interview so when I was at Google as a
recruiting
coordinator we ran this major experiment
around we call them GCA interview so
General cognitive ability and it is
exactly the interview that you're
describing and at one point we had eight
people who only ran the same interview
so literally we asking case questions
all day long and we tried to filter in I
mean you can't filter in like as many
candidates you know Google was doing
because it just didn't scale at that
moment in time with 30,000 employees
going to
 
that you found which is for the most
part and it's not a perfect system but
if you run a structured case interview
that is the closest correlation to on
job performance which honestly is like
not the finding that I wanted to have
because it feels like really this is the
best way that we can do it is with case
interviews but we found the same thing
yeah and I'll also you know I'll add on
interviewing we actually all of our
interviews are different we don't really
do any tell me about a time type of
interviews it is all because we're
different in the way that we work all of
our interviews are meant to mimic and
mirror the way that we work so we do
working sessions case studies like
grapple with a discussion topic have a
culture feedback session all things
intended to basically mimic what it's
like to work at Garner and see if this
person would thrive in that
environment so I have a strong belief
that the future of interviewing is going
to be much more
simulative such that like you get very
specific about what work is actually
like at your company and then you try
and simulate that throughout the entire
process still imperfect but it's much
better than you know these hypothetical
situational questions which have more to
do with pattern recognition of what
other smart people have said which could
potentially just be a signal of a good
interviewer versus a good
employee you said culture
feedback what what does that mean so
basically we do an interview where we so
we have a candid culture we put a lot of
emphasis in making sure that our candid
culture is both Direct and empathetic
because a lot of people are doing
various forms of cander very badly as
you know or it's just an excuse for the
CEO to go around and telling people
they're dumb that's not us that's not
our version um so basically in our
culture interview we test for Mission
alignment we test for but we spend a lot
of time on this piece of courageous
communication that um is a place where
we're particularly bespoke and so
essentially we start with asking the
candidate a tell me about a time
question where they gave Fe back to
someone and then we basically give them
lots of opportunities to fail in their
answers so that we can say like hey I
don't let me push you that wasn't a
great answer I have feedback I think
that was a narrow learning and you could
cut a much wider swath of change if you
pushed yourself to ask why a few times
and then we also ask for feedback and
the reason why we do these things is
because we are bespoke in the way that
we do feedback so if we did a tell me
about a time we're not even using the
word feedback the same way and so in
order I think think where you are
bespoke you can't do those types of
questions you have to test you have to
actually see how it works in practice
wow how do do you tell candidates that
this is coming because I'm of two minds
one is if you prepare a candidate for
this sort of interview they can come
like ready like with the example on the
other one you know you're thinking of
like well like they should have
something like pretty front of Mind of
when they experience this because we
want them to actually have done this in
the past and I think that sounds like a
core competency to Gardener how do you
guys think about prepping candidates for
these sorts of interviews we tell them
that most interviews are discussion and
and don't require a lot of prep with the
exception we do have like a deep case
more the simulation thing that you were
like more the exact work simulation type
of interview that you were talking about
we asked them to read our values
and you know candidates that read our
values will either be like yes or like
and so already there's a little bit of
self- selection there and the interview
is intended to be you know self is
intended to be selective in terms of if
people don't enjoy that they won't enjoy
working here yeah okay I love that and
then you had mentioned you didn't use
the word repellent but I'll use that
word how do how does the repellent piece
show up as part of the interview process
of where you're trying to make sure like
what are the maybe maybe it said
differently what are the most distinct
traits of gardener that either really
get people excited or really push them
away yeah it is it is like the two
places where where the most bespoke and
my two favorite things I also took away
from Bridgewater as it happen incredibly
high standards so some people are like
my work is good what's the problem and
we're like your work's not excellent
that's the problem and then and then the
cander you know some people just want to
be out of boys and out of girls and you
know others and aren't comfortable in an
environment where you know you've been
an executive for 20 years and a
 
on something and they're going to be
just as bright as you are and have just
as much right to question you as you
have to question them some people don't
like
that hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
Real Talk most Talent leaders haven't
yet cracked how to leverage AI for
Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting teams
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up up notes after every
interview but it's so much more than
just a time saer because perfect notes
means perfect data for every candidate
in every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
quora and check out medavie head over to
metav view. a/ herit to talk to one of
metav VI's product experts or get
started for free you'll be up running an
AI enabled in
minutes I love that so how does feedback
actually show up then on a day-to-day
basis for employees yeah so many ways
let me take you through a a day for me
of feedback I was actually I I will
limit myself to yesterday so yesterday I
started my day in my one-on-one with my
CEO we talked about a lot of things but
one I gave him feedback on I thought
that he wasn't accurately representing
our root cause analysis process and was
causing it to seem more scary to people
than what it really is which is like
incredibly supportive and uplifting and
a way to learn and so he was open-minded
to that we talked about a meeting he'
done recently and he was going to go and
like reassess how he had done in that
meeting and then we were going to come
back and discuss what he could do better
then he gave me feedback that he thought
that he'd seen my reliability as in my
IC work slipping over the course of the
last few months which I did not agree
with his examples and we had a good good
debate and we ended up having a meeting
of the minds and then later in the day
we had our promotion meeting at the end
of which our head of research our our
head of data and science and research
said okay Valentina I've been in two of
these now where we've promoted everyone
like are you are you holding a rubber
stamping meeting and I was like a great
question Phil and we all like had a
great conversation as a team where I was
able to explain how like all of the
pre-work and the fact that the meeting
exists is the reason why we promote
everyone because people are actually
like doing the hard work in advance so
we don't have to do it in the room but
like think about the benefits of those
things right like if I hadn't given Nick
that feedback he might be going around
scaring people when he's trying to
uplift them if he if Nick and I hadn't
had that conversation we'd be walking
around with two very different pictures
of my reliability and I might be
silently failing in his mind and if Phil
hadn't brought that thing out like
half the LC might be walking around
thinking I'm wasting their time or
better yet what if I was wasting their
time and they had actually won the day
on that argument like what a boon for me
to get that yet it might be slightly
painful in the moment but man is that a
gift I love that so much I mean you know
just for me personally it resonates
because I feel like my my co-founder
says this all the time the the
difference between nice and kind is
honesty totally and so nice people lie
to you all day kind people tell you the
truth and I think feedback has been
weaponized you know quite a bit there's
there's issues and actually maybe I I'll
ask you this question is how do you
solve the hierarchical feedback issue
right so it's one thing for for you know
you to receive feedback from Nick who's
your CEO it's another thing for you to
give feedback to Nick and then you know
multiply that dozens of times throughout
the hierarchy in the company
with the up can give down feedback but
down can't really give up feedback how
do you think about solving that problem
we are pretty non-h hierarchical in fact
I'm seriously considering getting rid of
titles right now but the best way that
we do it is by all of our the leaders a
demonstrating vulnerability and B
modeling this Behavior so like we'll be
in a management meeting like for example
with two new LC members one of the older
LC member longer ten members like Phil
or I will give Nick feedback live in the
meeting and so the new members of the
team are like oh wow I see this is how
it works and it's safe and the most
important thing is that Nick receives
and we all receive feedback with
gratitude we all reward voice right if
you re reward voice regardless of what
it's saying people will talk and then
you can determine the Merit of the ideas
you know later but first you reward the
voice that's a great that's a great
tactic I love that talk to me about
about like performance reviews do you
guys do performance reviews and how does
it show like you know there's one thing
about real-time feedback which is hey
I'm being I'm being honest with you
today which I think is absolutely
necessary that's where most companies go
wrong but then there's like this okay
time to like take a step back and like
really think about if you're applying
those things that we're talking about on
a daily basis and what I want to see you
work on into the future performance
reviews as part of our current macro are
getting
people hate them they are ineffective
they're a waste of time it feels like
you know the paper pushing bureaucracy
of HR is just stacking more papers on
your desk of to do how do you guys
think about that so I think we're in a
transition period from when I joined
which was a twice a year full-fledged
review period which yeah halted the
business for four months out of the year
or certainly the people team to a more
continuous process where people get
feedback regularly after projects and
then you do yes once a year we do do the
step back on performance the reason we
do that reasons we do that are twofold
and I think this is the reason why many
companies retain the review one we want
good strong triangulated data for
merit-based pay Merit based pay and
bonuses and then two so we want to we
want people to pause and think really
hard for you know a couple of weeks to
make sure that we are compensating
people fairly and rewarding people
fairly and then we're a datadriven
company and so we C like we have a we
have a rating scale well from one to
five We crave that data about how
employees are performing and so we try
we know that it's inherently biased we
try to make it as accurate as possible
but we do find that it gives us a good
directional read on how different
leaders are
managing do you force a curve on that
rating
scale we naturally as a high performing
company have you know kind of a what is
it power law curve and that I haven't
had to force that that is just happening
how is calibration happening for those
levels where there are a lot of
incumbents the individ like for example
engineering is a large team the
individual El individual leader of that
team will hold a calibration across
their department so actually all of our
in De calibrates together and then we
hold an LC calibration whereas
essentially Nick and my team and I look
across everything make sure that it
makes sense and then pull in different
LC members where we have questions we
will likely move into a like a fuller
calibration slash like succcess not I
don't want to use the word succession
because it's not really what I mean but
Talent Development let's say model for
our most senior talent but I won't like
I don't like the traditional ways of
doing that so I still haven't figured
out exactly what I'm going to invent
there I agree I think there's a there's
a big problem to be solved in this area
that nobody has actually like solved
very well but it sounds like you guys
are doing the best practices as as they
are today we're trying we're making up
our own best let's shift into manager
training sure so when you and I jammed
in our you know virtual Zoom coffee chat
you had told me this interesting
anecdote around manager training and
your unique approach to that can you
tell our audience a little bit about how
you guys think about manager training so
you know there's all this talk about the
new L &amp;d and how the classroom is dead
and how it's all about like gamification
and just in time and I agree with a lot
of that but I also think on the
classroom is dead part is pretty
seriously misguided unless you happen to
be a company that has an army of
phenomenal coaches in which case you are
the company that has all the phenomenal
coaches in the world because there's
only a handful of them or maybe a few
handfuls of them and so I believe that
the classroom is a way to scale a great
coach um not that I'm putting myself in
the handful of world class coaches to be
clear but I deliver all the teaching
myself and none of it is didactic we
don't do any didactic in the classroom
all the basics we do via written
trainings very Garner specific created
by my team like here's an outline of how
to manage Poe performance my people are
very smart they don't need to stand in a
room where I'm standing in front of them
and listen to me explain that so
everything that is basic is outlined in
a search
way and it's just like intended to take
the lift off of the thinking about the
basic stuff hopefully soon that'll be
automated and like we'll have little a
chatbot that will help you figure out
how to Think Through Your Basics on
Manager Management questions but the
hard stuff the really hard stuff I don't
think you can teach hard Concepts unless
you make it hard to teach them and I
don't think that like you have to really
grapple with like how do I trade off a
big KP I move versus this hole in my
processes and ecosystem a gamified
puzzle is not going to teach you how to
do that and so what we do in the
classroom is we bring hard business
problems smart people together and they
try to solve these hard business
problems and I design the business
problems not to have a solution because
there's no right answer but to drive
home certain principles and tenants that
they uncover themselves by solving the
business problem and I'm like hey what
principles did you use and they're like
well we realize that in org design it
you can actually determine how much IC
time a manager has by how senior their
reports are and how many they have I
just found a great new way to design
jobs Perfect all right so let me restate
some of this so I'm not very smart so I
think what dactic means is like I'm I'm
like standing in front of the classroom
and I'm like telling you what you should
do lecturing okay great so instead of
the traditional lecture process you do a
real world simulation and you present
yeah we write the lecture down let them
read it and then we do a real world
simulation okay and what are examples of
the real world simulation that's like
what like what what what would be like a
like a problem statement and and then
how like do they pair off or is it like
one person comes up with you and
everyone watch it what is that like y so
I'll give you a recent one it was
basically we were teaching
prioritization and the case was welcome
to Garner you're the new head of
marketing here is a list of priorities
and where they stand from your
predecessor which was like a three-page
list of red Amber green nonsense here's
your current or chart and here's an
email from the CEO about an engagement
marketing problem that he thinks is
going on what do you do and basically
what the group came up what the so yes
then they break off into small groups
and I teach two courses a manager course
and then a manager of manager course the
second of which is a little more
advanced they break off and the best Cas
the best groups came back with there's
no kpis here so the first thing I would
do is figure out like what am I actually
going after there's way too much on this
list and so a I've driven home now the
principle of you must form your kpis and
know what you're going after first
there's too much on this list I've
driven home the principle of we don't
peanut butter at Garner we Crush two to
three things with overwhelming Force the
org design is a mess so that allows me
to throw some org design tenets in there
and that's kind of how it goes and then
at the end I'm like here are the
insights you all came up with and so far
each time the case led to the exact
insights that I wanted it to but they
got them on their own that's so cool I
just have to like get into this stuff
because when I hear new things I'm like
all right tell me how you do it because
I want to think about this for myself so
how long is each case so the courses are
each each in-classroom learning is 90
minutes each case we depending on
whether we do two or three each case in
total between when I give it to them
their time to solve it and then our time
to talk about it is typically like 45
minutes and we'll do two yeah yeah okay
that makes sense and are you doing these
in person are you doing these over Zoom
I'm doing them virtually virtually over
Zoom okay yeah you got to make hybrid
work yeah and they break into groups and
then I you know I I go through the
breakout groups we make sure that the
in-person people have are in a zoom room
where I can jump in there and so I can
help poke and direct a little bit but
not much are people are smart
wow it just leads me to the the the
question that goes to my mind which is
okay one of the hardest things that
managers never practice is terminating
an employee
do you all practice that yes we just
finished designing your function and I'm
about to go into managing your people
but yeah difficult performance
situations will definitely be a case
that we'll do it's so wild to me that
the first time somebody actually goes
through that experience from the the
manager they made the decision now
they've decided to terminate an employee
and deliver that to somebody is
literally when they're in the room
delivering that to somebody yeah no
that's wild we well that would never
happen on of my companies because I make
sure that my hrbps are thoughtful or My
People Partners are thoughtful and
particularly since I've always had a lot
of new managers that they just say hey
give me your talk track and let's prank
yeah I yeah I I do think though that
there's a there's an aspect of truly
simulation especially with your
peers that I I think could be insanely
beneficial for just all of these hard
things that we have to do in management
every single day yeah identifying poor
perform performance I mean in a in a
high feedback culture like in a high
feedback culture drawing the line from
when you're I'm giving feedback to
invest in your long-term future at
Garner to I'm giving feedback because
I'm no longer sure you have a long-term
future at Garner if you don't do that
well everyone's
confused so yes very important Valentina
this was so much fun I I think we
covered about three and a half hours
worth of content in 45 minutes I told
you this before we started one of the
things I love about you is you're very
high content to word ratio and so I just
