What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics. We're
back with AI Corner with our homie Sle.
Sy, what's up, man? I'm good. I'm good.
How you doing? I'm doing great. All
right. So sle, there's been a lot going
on in AI recently. And one of the trends
I'm seeing on X is I'll call it the CEO
mandate. And so I've seen two CEOs for
sure. One's Toby Luki of Shopify. The
other one is Aaron Levy of Box. And
essentially what they're doing is
they're sending out memos to their
companies and saying everybody needs to
be using AI and natively using AI. Toby
said some really interesting stuff in
his memo. Uh he said uh you must be
reflexive like AI usage must be
reflexive and is that's now a baseline
expectation. He said the way you get
good at AI is by using it which is
obvious to me. And then before asking
for headcount or resources teams must
demonstrate what they can't get done
without AI. So what's your take on this
trend and and how are you thinking about
it as CEO of Metav? Yeah I think AI is
just all hype to be honest with you. I
think this is
all. Um, uh, no, like I think it makes
total sense. Basically, I've also seen
the Dolingo CEO Luis Fernan, he he put
out a very similar very similar point.
They they frankly have like pressures. I
I don't want to speak on their I don't
know enough, but like I know there's a
bunch of AI native language learning
applications out there that are doing
really well. So, I'm sure they see it as
like a very competitive threat as well,
but uh yeah, they they've done the same
thing. Um and I've heard about it from
our customers as well where they have um
uh tried to work with us to basically
lean on us to help them tell the story a
little bit more internally of how they
are already an AI native recruiting
team. So basically it's happening like
as far as I'm concerned across the board
in any forward thinking company and yeah
it makes total sense on our side. We we
we are an AI company but we still find
that frankly we interview candidates who
like are not fully sort of worshiping at
the altar of the LLM yet. And for us
that's like a massive red flag. So it's
definitely more formed in the minds of
technology leadership than it is in the
minds and like the fingers on keyboard
work of a lot of the people like that do
the work frankly. So yeah not surprised
to see it as a trend have heard about it
before these very public um these public
sort of shoutouts for it. Uh, and I
think it's like a total inevitability
that people who know how to orchestrate
AI are going to be more effective and
people who aren't sort of jumping on the
train and sort of like learning these
skills. They're not sewing the seeds
that they need to sew for their future
success and they're going to be found
out at some point when they're trying to
interview at my company or someone
else's company and they're like, "Oh,
dang. You're not actually going to know
how to like how to operate within our
company." Yeah. So, I I heard a sound
bite from a friend this week around uh
headcount management. So in the past
typically like if an employee leaves
immediately like a back fill opens this
is especially true at bigger companies
and at this company which is a very
large public company they are no longer
immediately approving headcount in fact
like they are holding it and saying well
how can you get more leverage with new
technology i.e. AI and and so I keep
thinking about this of like what does
this mean? And so I think thing one is
you have to be using it every day. I'm
I'm still talking to people who are like
ah I use it like once a week. Yeah. And
Toby's point about using it reflexively
is exactly the feedback I've been trying
to get myself. Yeah. Which is just like
when something comes up instead of like
pinging a friend, I'm like I'm trying to
treat chat GPT as my friend. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh I and I think number two is I think
we're starting to see it already just
just very small so far, but headcount is
going to come down or at least flatten,
right? Because if you do have more
leverage, you don't need as many
employees. What's your what's your view
on the headcount piece? I think that's
going to happen and I think there's
going to probably be an unfortunate um
and maybe you're doing this to be honest
and but I could be wrong so I'm not I
think this is more like exploring this.
I think there's an unfortunate maybe
sort of a connective tissue drawn
between well AI gives us leverage
therefore we need less people whereas I
think it might actually be more of a
necessity is the mother of invention. So
the fact that you are not allowed to
hire more people means that I'm going to
force you to start to you now it's
necessary that you become more efficient
and clearly your avenue to do that is to
get much more proficient with AI which
is going to be good for me as a good for
me as a business leader or good for us
as a business. So I think it might be
more that than it is because I want to
use this to to like make sure we have a
smaller team. Uh I think things will
snap back and people really in this new
formed way of working where you have AI
much more at the core of how how
business gets done within these
companies. You may find that sort of
teams are just as large actually and you
just like make use of the fact that you
have this intelligence on tap and the
more people you have that can
orchestrate it means that you can ship
things quicker. Like I would still go
back to every company including mine um
has a list of things they want to do
that is far longer than the list of
things that they're currently doing. So
it's not and I I think that's probably
true for Shopify and these other
companies we've mentioned. They have a
they have a massive backlog of things
they wish they could do that they're not
doing. And so I don't think they're
looking well we're not going to hire
these people because we don't want to do
these things on our backlog. They're
looking it as almost fixing the sort of
the average leverage per employee in the
company and like this is a way to force
that, but they still want to get through
their backlog far quicker and like win
the game. So I I think there'll be an
unfortunate sort of dis like maybe
misappropriate mis uh mislabeling of
this is just a pure cost cutting thing.
I I don't think that's probably what
these these folks are thinking. Yeah,
it's a really good point which is just
like always the product roadmap is like
it it's never ending essentially at
almost every company.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
If you're the decision maker at your
company, we have great news for you, for
your HR organization, and for your
employees. A new and future forward way
to do health benefits is here from
Thatch. Not only do your employees get
better health benefits with thatch, but
you save an average of
$1,620 per employee per year. That's
right. You can save over $1,600 per
employee per year. Plus, that reduces
the time the HR team spend administering
benefits. Businesses all over the
country love Statch's breakthrough
approach. Rather than a wasteful
one-sizefits-all plan, that empowers
their employees by letting them
customize their own benefits plan. You
save money and time while providing
employees with better health benefits,
which works better for everyone. Book a
demo with Thatch and we'll send you a
$100 gift card. Visit
thatch.ai/hr to book a demo for your
gift card. That's
 
thatch.ai/hr. Your workforce is your
organization's greatest strength and
often its largest single expense. But

The one thing Aaron from box said which
I thought was like really interesting as
one of his bullets was to upskill every
employee to be AI first over time with
more education and awareness.
So, okay. So, I I trained mixed martial
arts and the guy who I train with, uh,
he has been using AI to as like a coach
and a thought partner for how to give
his employees
feedback. And it was like a really
interesting thing. And then I heard
someone else say, I'm using Chad GPT as
my therapist. Mhm. And so it made me
think a little bit about L &amp; D, which is
kind of like one of these topics that uh
I've been hating on for a while because
I feel like the ROI is pretty low.
Nobody wants to like sit in a class or
like do a course that's making your eyes
bleed. And so I actually think Aeron's
on to something here, which is using AI
or even like AI native tools. So maybe
it's not chat GBT, maybe it's something
more
purpose-built to help upskill the the
people we already have and making that
more on the employee versus the
employer. What do you think about that?
I think like personal tuition like which
is obviously some people are talking a
lot about in the education realm. I
think maybe it was probably like 18
months ago now, but Khan Academy where a
part of one of the GPT releases um uh
sort of Khan Academy sort of came out
and showed like what this personal AI
tuition could look like. Um, uh, I think
that's a real thing and I think that
will infect every part of our that that
that will also be true within within an
organization. Um, I guess the only thing
I'm I think sometimes you have a
tendency to like
um like straight up replace the current
workflow. Hey, humans are currently
helping you with your L &amp; D and they get
up in front of on stage and like tell
you about this stuff and um, now we can
do that like on demand. You don't have
to actually do it at a time that
person's available. you can do it when
that's not really what's going to
happen. It's just going to be more much
more like in the- moment tuition when
you need it. which I think why this
reflexiveness is a really good word to
use because it's one of the sort of the
core core things that you should um have
in mind when you're blocked on something
is well who can help me with this
problem and I remember back when I was
well frankly you know anything before
like 2 and a half years ago the idea
would be you'd have like rules for
yourself like you know I'll spend like
 
for myself and if I'm literally getting
nowhere only then will I speak to my and
you'd get pissed off with some members
your team like you're asking me as soon
as you hit the block. You haven't even
tried to solve this yourself. That's
bad. And you get pissed off with other
members of your team. Like you've been
looking at this for 3 hours and if you
had have asked me, I could have told you
what to do. And so like that sort of is
going to go away and you're going to
bring in an AI to help you and like work
through these things and that's how
you're going to learn. You're going to
learn by doing. So I don't know if it'll
be a straightup like L &amp; D thing. Um
maybe there'll be like a sort of this
sort of like uh inception moment where
it's like the L &amp; D to teach people how
to use AI will be more sort of
traditional because you need to sort of
I totally think so. I I 100% think
that's coming. Like I dropped a video
this week. Did you see that video I
dropped? Like I dropped a video this
week of like two hours of like it's on
my LinkedIn. That thing like 10 minutes
in I was like, "Oh my god, I've never
seen this before." And so like I do
think there is this like how to use it
thing which we've talked about in the
past that people need to figure out.
Yeah. Yeah. I think I I think um I think
like show and tell like we do this even
when frankly in our in our like customer
success motion is we will have people
when we deploy metview at a company
there are like some power user features
that some people naturally gravitate
obviously we do a bunch of work to try
and get people familiar with them
whatever but you know some people just
naturally pick it up more quickly than
others and then like what can we do to
like put those people on a pedestal and
make sure everyone's aware of how
they're doing their work. So I think
like it is a bit of monkey see monkey do
type situation. Um, one of the things
that again this is like pre this is like
this is more to do with L &amp; D frankly
than it is to do with AI is um merely
knowing that something is possible is
the the biggest thing often to unlock
your ability to keep on trying to try
and do it. Right? If you don't know if
something's possible or not, you will
just like you might stop after 20
minutes. Say there's a chance this isn't
possible. I haven't been able to do it
in 20 minutes. I'll probably just go and
do you know go and do something else
instead. Whereas if you know if you've
seen even if it's like in a distance if
you or one of these YouTube videos
you've seen that someone knows how to do
this you'll keep on going so you crack
it because you know you know it's
possible. So I think they'll be like
just holding up examples of people doing
great work um that will probably unlock
a lot of ingenuity. But I think the sort
of like force
feeding, you know, you're going to have
to get AI like that that's
I don't think that's I don't I don't
think like yeah, you'll get some
success, but it's probably like you you
know what's the phrase uh that I'm I'm
looking for. Um if you want to like
there's some some like old explorer had
this phrase that was like uh if you want
people to sort of sail the world with
you, don't like tell them to go and
fetch wood and build a boat. Just teach
them to long for the seas. That's like
the people who do the great work are
going to be the people who like see what
amazing things can be done and then like
push the boundaries of it themselves
because they want the outcome and like
what you can teach them is sort of like
incidental. It might help them along the
way. It might help them get there like a
few few days or hours quicker, but it's
probably not going to be the the
difference maker. I love your idea of
taking like someone who's using it in
like a really interesting capacity and
putting them up in front of everybody in
a showand tell way and saying like just
show them what you're doing like that
actually that is uh that's the positive
version of how we can use AI in the
organization and how it's a baseline
expectation. I think the the more of
like the stick version of it is I think
we're going to start to see this come up
in performance reviews. I think it's
going to be a performance review
question which is like how are you using
AI to create more leverage in your
day-to-day work. That question is 100%
coming. And you know to your point I
think it's I think it's probably
actually both, right? Which is like we
have this carrot version which is like
show the best person and like and have
that like be a recurring theme on a
weekly basis and then the stick version
which is like all right it's performance
time. We don't we haven't heard from
you. We're going to make sure that
you're actually using it. Yeah. to
totally be but just because that's
that's that would be temporary too,
right? Like that's just because we're
giving people grace of like, hey, if
you're trying to use AI, if you're if if
you're not actually making yourself more
efficient, but you are trying because
you're exploring and we none of us fully
know how to do this yet, then we're
going to give you grace on that. But at
some point, it's just going to come down
to like who are my most efficient and
productive as it always does at some
level. Who are my most efficient and
productive and effective people in the
company? And if I have whatever my way
existing way of measuring that I'm going
to I'm going to sort of like uh the the
the way you get there will of course be
leveraging AI because anyone who any
high performer is going to be leveraging
it. Uh unless we're all wrong and this
is all is hype and not true which of
course we all have accepted is not
anymore. Um, but it's just going to be I
think I think we'll again we'll sort
of there's a lot there's some things
don't change as well, you know. I I
think people want more productive
effective teammates and employees and
this is a proxy for that, but there'll
probably be a little bit of spun wheels
and like wasted effort trying to like
force things to be, you know, go through
the lens of AI unnecessarily. But net
net, it's going to be a really good
thing. Yep, it certainly is a proxy. All
right, everybody. So, let us know what
you want to see on the next AI corner. S
and I are riffing ideas right now. Uh
but I find these to be very helpful. Sy,
thanks so much for the time man. Yeah.
One thing I just want to add, I'd love
to know other folks out there uh if
there has been AI mandate. Obviously,
these folks have done these public
proclamations. They're really large
companies. I know it's happening at
smaller companies uh all the time. So,
we'd love to sort of uh hear folks's
experience with that and and like how
they've reacted to it. What have they
done about it? Yep. Sounds good. Thanks
all.
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Dosha who leads talented signal fire
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick. Metiv is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metaview changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver. Because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. MeteView covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora and check out
Metav. Head over to
metave.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metab's product experts. Tell them that
me and Kelly sent you. Or you could just
go to their website and get started for
free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in minutes.
