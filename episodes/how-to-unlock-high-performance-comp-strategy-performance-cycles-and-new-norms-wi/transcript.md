# How to Unlock High Performance: Comp Strategy, Performance Cycles, and New Norms with David Hanrahan

## Transcript

 
the job of a leader through uncertain
times is to add more truth in the world
and Truth is not is not spinning truth
is here's what we know here's what we
don't know and so I've seen this
multiple times in startups where you get
out of an all hands and it's like the
feeling is like things are great and
it's like how what happened why did we
just we blew that messaging things are
not
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
 
great
 
hey everyone welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast where we get into the
real talk of company construction these
are the conversations that happen
between Founders Chief people officers
and board members behind closed doors
we're Heretics in this industry because
there's a culture of Silence around
important business topics especially
with people but on the show we tell the
truth and expect the same from our
guests today we're so excited to
introduce you to David Henry hand David
is the chief people officer at Flair
this was a good one Nolan I have known
David for years and years I mean he's
kind of like a brother at this point and
I call him like the professor I don't
know he he's just always been so like
thoughtful and cerebral around HR topics
and leading teams and Company culture he
just puts it all together with EA and
Twitter on zenes Niantic Evite I mean
these are amazing companies that he's
been a part of and was it was great to
talk to him about how he applied all
that through his journey you're exactly
right that David is cerebral and I love
David because he's no fluff and no
 we got into some really
interesting discussions around how he
thinks about compensation and how it
should be entirely around top performers
I loved his his discussion around his
personal experience with burnout and how
he needed to take time back to reset I I
Mo I don't find most people are as
authentic as David yeah he just he just
kind of is what it is and just question
answer question answer and has a sense
of humor along the way so it's really
entertaining but he was very transparent
about how he changed too in his HR
career from early on and how he would
push his agenda and and approach his
work and how he's kind of came over the
hump and thinks about that pretty
differently you can tell how comfortable
David is in his skin by how authentic he
is is and I just appreciate him being in
the seat and still being okay with
getting into the juicier and meteor
topics and I I just think he is one of
the best people at the job yeah agreed
so without further Ado here's David
David thanks for joining me and Kelly
today we're super excited to have you
here thanks for having me all right I
want to start with the burnout question
in people Ops like there's a lot of
conversation around people leaders
feeling burnt out postco my question is
do you feel like people leaders have
gotten a little
 
soft um
yes um I can I can I can speak from my
experience I def I definitely got soft I
I left my last gig because I was burnt
out and I said there's something wrong
here I um I told my boss um in a one1
one day um two about two years ago
literally two years ago where I said you
know what I think I'm done and she said
'what do you mean you're done are you
done with this topic we're talking about
and I'm like no I think I'm done with my
career like in the moment it was just
like a light bul moment of like I just I
don't have anything left in the tank and
now looking back on it at that time what
was floating around me was CPO burnout
and I'm like started thinking about to
myself like I'm burnt out this is like
I'm with I'm in that group I'm in this
group and it was sort of
self-perpetuating in a sense and I
stepped away from the work I remember I
told my wife after call I'm like I think
I just resigned she like what are you
going to do and I'm like I think I'm
going to like meditate and like mountain
bike and stuff so speaking of soft like
I was like was definitely silent
Retreats yeah silent Retreats I remember
your LinkedIn post you were doing film
photography I took I took film classes I
um I just I kind of um and what I would
say is for me it was the time was super
impactful to get back to the mode I
think I'm in right now which is like I
feel like for better words it's a little
bit more hard edged like I feel a little
bit more like I'm fired up I feel like
I'm you know 10 to 15 years ago in my
career where like everything I was doing
had me fired up and like nothing phases
me now I don't know why but like the
time the time away refilled my tank and
so um when I have a bad day I just feel
super resilient to it now and so when I
see the headlines around me of so and so
is burnt out or so and so stepping away
I'm like it it I remember what they were
going through but I I did what I needed
to do to kind of get into a more
resilient space yeah D David you've had
 
different things now you know I I feel
as though early in my career I I was a
little bit more passionate about pet
projects things that like I was a novel
concept of something I read in a in an
hbr article or Tech crunch of like oh
yeah I want to iterate on that and just
you know removed from what business
needs were I just had a little thing I
was going to bring to zenes or a little
a little sort of like a personal
branding of like I'm going to be all
about this thing here and um maybe just
like like sort of time experience I
don't know wisdom whatever you want to
call it i' I've realized that it's not
about it's not about bringing your your
like your personal passion projects to
your work but like deeply understanding
what where is your company currently at
what are some of the sensibilities of
the leaders and some of them might not
align with like things that I believe in
but but hopefully I'm balance most of
them do and I'm going to find a way for
us to sort of make something work for us
here on on our compensation approach on
a performance approach on sort of the
employee experience things that I maybe
would have never thought about bringing
to zenes we're going to go deep on these
to make sure we're really aligned As
Leaders on them so I'm a little bit less
like my personal passion um and more
about finding what is unique about us
and getting energized about that it's
going to be a different it's going to be
a different chapter and just embracing
that um so so I think I think the time
away helped me reflect a little bit
about like what's important in work in
life and like also not trying to get all
my meaning out of my work um I've got a
family I've got kids you know like I can
end my day having a really bad day at
work and I'm much more likely to just
close a laptop and it doesn't bother me
whereas I think early in my career a bad
day at work would really bother me like
if I had a tough conversation with a
boss or you know like I just feel like
we let someone down I would it would
just bother me I would bring it into the
next conversation I'd just be like I
wouldn't have the same Mojo and I'm I'm
much more short-term memory now I can
just forget something and move on like
okay well next up like next project next
next conversation gotta gotta show up
right here it's a really interesting
take on like the pet projects versus
actually like what the business needs
one of the things that I've noticed over
the course of the last call it five to
seven years is the business need and
employee expectation that like the Gap
actually feels like it's getting bigger
I thought like you know this correction
over the course of the last 18 months
was going to narrow that Gap I don't I
don't know if that's actually happening
right now I'm curious to see like what
you're actually seeing and then how
you're thinking about
that yeah the the gap between like what
employees are expecting and sort of like
what employers are expecting exactly and
what I mean what employers need to build
real
businesses yeah I you know I think so
just if we if we rewind the mode that we
just come out of so great resignation
super employee Friendly Market um
companies companies really um twisting
in all sorts of different directions to
give things to sort of relinquish
control to sort of to trust more work
from anywhere do all these things have
all that you want and because they kind
of had to to compete um and then you
know amidst that not all sorts of great
things were happening when you think
about social isolation and like like
people people burning out parents like
struggling and so companies are trying
to give more it wasn't always
translating to like better mental health
or outcomes for employees and then you
know great resignation people moving in
different directions and then a hard a
hard pivot like whoa time out VC money
has gone away and now it's back to the
employers the employers are now the
employers are maybe like thinking gosh
we screwed up we're trying to Pivot now
hard to correct the other way return to
office layoffs um cutting things you
know um and so so the Gap is still the
Gap is still there it's just kind of
gone in a different direction of the Gap
and I deal with these questions I'll
deal with these questions in all hands
like um one question like are we having
layoffs to like you know when am I going
to get my pay increase and sort of like
this like whoa the same question just
right after the other or this question
right after that question and um there's
this dichotomy I think for employees
also the Gap I think is is increasing
and where I see it is like employers may
be sometimes operating from a mode of
fear of like we've given away some
things I'm fearful of the headwinds I'm
fearful of the economy and like I'm just
kind of going to react to I'm just going
to do what others are doing I'm looking
to fellow fellow co-founders I'm going
to do what they're doing I'm just going
to play it safe and I think you have to
continue to sort of bring leaders
together to talk about how are we going
to create a high performing workplace
let's not let's try and block out all
the noise how are we we going to create
a high performing workplace how are we
going to create execution and like like
a humming machine how are we going to do
that is that about returning to the
officers about other things like what is
the data telling us in our survey
results it's people are misunderstanding
the strategy we got to somehow fix
communication internally we got to
create a beat of communication from
leaders to mid-level managers down to
employers down to employees and and
create um create more sort of Beats that
that can translate to wins that sort of
like start to perpetuate in terms of
like people are seeing what we're doing
is working we can block out noise intern
externally what we're doing is working
and there's a there's there's a beat
there and it's starting to feel good and
it's starting to translate to later
things like incentives or things that we
can kind of give back to the workforce
that are that are earned that are like
earned as opposed to previously I was I
was beholden to give you these things
and then I felt beholden to take them
away and now we're giving them back
because they've been earned so the the
Divergence is something that I've seen
and felt too especially the LA over the
last two to three years it's just really
difficult
you know to get everyone on that same
page four years ago was kind of like the
Market's good people are making money
everyone was kind of rising tide lifts
all boats happy for the most part H I
have a hypothesis and I wanted to to ask
you if you'd agree and advice for the
audience that the generational
differences has created a lot of
different viewpoints reactions points of
view preferences on what employees think
employers should be doing shouldn't be
doing understanding this phenomenon
that's going on in the market because
many have never seen it before right so
I my question is do you agree there is
just deviations of different Generations
now all put together going through this
and what what are some tips on how to
get all those folks
coalesced yeah um I was just in an event
where we talked about this and we talked
about you know is the generation
entering the workforce a me generation
or or is it a Wii generation or are we
just misunderstanding it like you know
one generation is misunderstanding what
generation entering Workforce wants and
so we had we had people from each
generation in this in this in this
meeting talking about this and what we
acknowledged was there's definitely
something going on around isolation and
individualism that can even be
translated to performance reviews
performance reviews exacerbate
individualism they don't they don't
perpetuate team based sort of community
building and I think for people leaders
you got to recognize we're just coming
out of a mode where like there was a lot
of um all for one you know like like I'm
all I'm all about myself and what we
need to be doing is is like team
building and community building and the
generation entering Workforce actually
wants that so they don't want they don't
want to be alone that and and so like
one one of these individuals in in the
in this team said like you know what you
would think that you would you would
read data that says the generation
entering Workforce wants to be able to
work for from anywhere they want to be
left alone they don't want to they want
to don't want to interact with others
and when we have opened up the offices
optionally this person sharing this
anecdote it was the generation that
entering the workforce that wanted to be
around others they wanted to be they
wanted they want a community and they
want their employer to create a
community that is like that is worth
joining and that's very different than
sort of individualism and isolation um
so I think we Mis understand each other
agree I had an employee tell me this
this last year they said you know we
want the same thing that they right they
want it's just we don't want to be told
when and how and where we literally want
it we just don't want to be told exactly
prescriptively what to do super
interesting you you mentioned
performance and I want to spend some
time on performance with you right now
I'm hearing from Founders that like
performances under the biggest
microscope that they've ever seen um
they care deeply about high performance
per in cultures um making sure that
everyone in the company is is performing
at a high level uh and given now that
like layoffs are still like really like
the talk of Silicon Valley and and
companies are still doing a lot of cuts
and I think really underneath those cuts
are like perfor is Performance
Management that hadn't been happening
for a couple of years what's your take
on like how do you measure the success
of an employee like what is high
performance to
you
yeah um well I I I think you can I think
you can create different definitions
around it you could say you know are you
meeting expectations occasionally
exceeding it and that's like solid you
could say you're exceeding expectations
because you're delivering some impact
that was not
expected um and then you're not meeting
expectations I think you can Define it
different ways I mean you know Kelly's
certainly seen this like you know we
just sort of go back and forth like we
word Smith you know language and where
where a lot of I think where a lot of
the muscle building around Performance
Management is in particularly early
stage companies that are building a
muscle around this and we're getting
more mature is around calibration and
alignment and sort of honesty like
honesty internal like you know being
able to talk um specifically amongst
each other on our teams or when we're
seeing high performance when we're
seeing low performance and like what is
happening there and depersonalizing it
and so usually um I'd say early stage
companies are not good at number one
they probably don't have a great
definition so like the table Stakes to
get a definition but then they're not
great at at calibration an alignment and
talking about it openly in a way where
it's not going to offend everyone to
talk about it to find ways to sort of
like hey that was great why was it great
what was the impact that it had that was
not great what is at the root of that
and I think um if if for leaders if I'm
a founder or if I have a leadership team
and like there's an outcome that's
positive for this it's not having a
spreadsheet that is that is you know all
the ratings at any given time and we see
it and we have an action item I remember
dealing with a Founder whose whose goal
was to have uh ratings so that there's
an action off to the right so we know if
we're letting this person go they're
going on a performance plan or we're
promoting them or whatever and like I
don't think that's your that's your
outcome ultimately your outcome is
something that I think a lot of
companies don't think about in
Performance Cycles which is the
team so perform performance reviews for
individuals has a value for the
individual so that I know I'm like I get
I'm clear where I stand as not a mystery
anymore and like between me and my boss
we've broken the we've broken through
the honesty barrier and like okay I get
it I disagree with it but I I get it now
and so I know what's being asked of me I
can choose to stay here be part of that
or not um leaders then can kind of
calibrate and say I see where individual
performance I see I see what that means
in high performance But ultimately you
launch a product you know you change a
service you know you you sort of derive
Revenue you derive like margin
performance through teams through the
effectiveness of teams and we could go
through an entire Performance Cycles
where the team-based view of performance
is totally obfuscated so we said this
team is is like you know four of these
five individuals are high performers but
the view of that team is complete
opposite that's a dysfunctional team and
like yeah those are all rock stars but I
don't get anything I need from this team
and like I see your dilemma there you
know that you've got some some high
performers it's like I have a I have an
orchestra of these are all like virtuoso
soloists and but I need them to perform
as an orchestra then I need them to make
music together or these these
individual sports athletes these
baseball players are like wow they're
phenomenal but they're horrible as a
team and so I think Founders need to
come out of Performance Cycles or or
leaders need to come out of Performance
Cycles with increasingly a view of the
team performance and and I think that's
like really um not done well in
individual performance reviews you have
to have a completely different
conversation you could literally like
you could like let's stack rank our
teams we're the high performing teams of
this company we're the low performing
teams of this company and why what's at
the root of that is that the leader is
that something they're not set up for
Success they're not positioned well and
we can make those adjustments that has
much greater impact to the organization
than just you know making sure we have
performance RW in place for everyone
have you done that like have you have
you tactically like started at the team
level like with as it relates to your
Performance Cycles and how you run them
like when you're thinking around okay
like let's do calibration let's
calibrate on the team before we
calibrate on the individuals like how
does that tactically work and do people
get it like I mean I I'm having a little
bit of a hives thinking about wrapping
middle Management's heads around this
concept which is makes total sense but
curious on how you work through that
yeah I've done it probably the past past
two companies um and I'll talk about
like
Eventbrite we um we showed a difference
of the percentage of high performers
like this team over here has the highest
percentage of high performers this team
over here has the like the um lowest
percentage of high performers or the
highest percentage of low of high
highest percentage of low performers
highest percentage of high performers
and then we asked the executive team is
this right in terms of these teams like
the team like your view of these teams
that's the high performing team that's
the low performing team like no it's
completely opposite no like that's that
manager over there is being honest
they're being way too honest that is not
a low performing team I'm surprised that
that is that's the team that shows up as
our lowest performing team just because
the manager has has marked a lot of
their individuals is not performing or
or they're very they've kept they've
kept a very high bar for high
performance that's that's not accurate
that's not an accurate view of of our
teams and that's not an accurate view of
our high performing teams that's and and
so what happens from there there's a
sort of message back to the leader of
like timeout there's there's a there's
something not right here you can't come
to this you can't come out of this cycle
with like that view of your team based
performance because that's not the
perspective of your team and there's
this light bulb moment of like oh so
that's not showing up well then to the
next level right so I'm not showing up
well as saying all these individuals are
high performing I didn't realize that's
the perspective of my team no one's
debating me that those individuals are
great I they don't even know they don't
even know some of these individuals but
my view has now been challenged of my
team just because we had that
conversation um so then you could do it
you could do it without the data you
could do when we did in my last company
we stack ranked the teams we said were
the low performing teams were the high
performing teams independent of what the
manager said and then that was an output
back to those leaders of hey just so you
know your your team is viewed as one of
the highest performing teams in the
company just so you know your team is
viewed as one of the lowest performing
individuals of the lowest performing
teams of the company and what does that
do for the leader going through the
cycle like I need to make some changes I
need to make some changes that are not
just I need to deliver a tough message
to you I might need to make some like
organizational changes and and then that
starts to unlock a lot more in my
experience than just okay we got three
cycle hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors hey everybody your co-host

description below ping me on LinkedIn if
you have any questions or head to join
continuum. so tough economy right now
efficiency is the right the bottom line
is the new Top Line in a lot of ways um
a lot of cultures are being now called
Soft cultures right if you're trying to
save money the first thing to do is
crack down on on on the folks that aren
aren't doing well and so that's forced a
lot of companies to want to be have to
be more transparent right if they're if
they're turning out the juice on their
Performance Management Systems now based
on the macro maybe they didn't even have
one before it's forcing them to now talk
about this new thing and be more
transparent with their practices in the
organizations what advice do you have
for folks listening around that what are
the core elements if you're going to be
transparent you you can't boil the ocean
and go from zero to 100 what do you be
trans parent about right how do you
start to talk to the company about this
if you really haven't been doing it
openly the past two or three years
there's a quote um from the pandemic I
remember I forget who said it but the
job of a leader through uncertain times
is to add more truth in the world and
and so truth is not is not spinning
truth is here's what we know here's what
we don't know and so I seen this
multiple times in startups where you get
out of an all hands and it's like the
feeling is like things are great
and it's like how what happened why did
we just we blew that messaging things
are not great like we just we went
through a whole all hands and we gave
this Rosy picture and okay don't want to
freak people out I want to give them
information the right information the
right people at the right time with the
right context I need to make sure you
understand where the problems are in the
company and and who's working on it so
you can support those individuals and if
we don't have a solution to this yet you
at least are aware that this is a big
problem for us and over here we're
seeing gains here's here's the wins and
we keep a consistent scorecard so we're
not sort of creating a new scorecard
every month and every All Hands of like
oh this is important now and then what
about that last thing that we said was
important so um so what you know and
what you don't know so truth is what you
know what you don't know um keep it as
as simple as possible um write
information to the right time right
people at the right time with the right
context so it's not about sort of I'm
going to open source all Google Docs at
the company and like you get to see all
the sort of you know the the gnarly
stuff because that's just going to dis
disrupt people and make them
unnecessarily um
worried um and and I think you have to
normalize some some topics normalize and
sort of destigmatize some topics that
might freak people out so we have to
normalize like some terms that maybe
previously like we didn't use those
terms we didn't use sort of like we have
to perform at a high level you know we
didn't talk about how our our
Performance Cycle and our comp cycle is
really about rewarding high performance
it sounded like it was reward for
everyone and now we're saying we're
saying something different and we got to
normalize some of that language which
feels like maybe a little bit less soft
maybe it feels like a little bit more
like it's gonna be hard we're going to
normalize it's going to be hard we think
there's rewards for it um we're going to
normalize the the scorecard that we use
and so it's more
predictable and um and treat people like
adults um so on the on the normalization
front so like are you
normalizing like terminating employees
after Performance Cycles like is that
one of the things that you're trying to
normalize I think it's already pretty
well understood but I think it's less
about sort of normalizing that that
could happen because I think that
probably feels like holding something
over someone's heads um like that could
happen that could happen but what we
want to make sure people know in the
performance like like I just got out of
these conversations we want you to know
where you're standing relative to
expectation we want it to be absolutely
clear you know you know what's expected
of you because sometimes you know in
startup Lang startup with like a green
manager I'm kind of like I'm working my
way through this I don't really know the
right language to use it just gets
totally unclear it gets totally unclear
am I doing well am I doing not doing
well I me it can get it can get unclear
in All Hands Like Whoa We didn't like we
didn't share some stuff we should have
shared there and so the normalization is
more of the language so you just know
that like I'm just G to be really honest
with you you're doing well on this
you're not doing well on that I don't
think it's going great so but here's
what you can do here's what you can do
to improve things and um and that feels
like a shift to me like in some prior
companies like in the great resignation
I don't think that that the Performance
Cycle was maybe in some companies a
little bit more about I want to make
sure you feel good you're motivated you
know you're motivated to just stay here
you know yeah quit really quick on that
I wanted to I I've talked to a few
Founders and a few peers right chap
people officers that have kind of said
this this macro has given us a little
bit of License to be a bit tougher and
to send harder messages than previously
right in the spirit of retention and
keeping you happy and all these things
so do you think the pendulum has shifted
a bit a bit on this side and what what
do you think about that um you know
like I think the sort of like finding
your inner Elon or whatever is probably
not the mode for most Founders like you
got to find the voice that works for you
that is like really direct and clear um
the license to sort of take things away
or the license to you know like it's
it's if it's G to make you a
fundamentally different person than
what's your strong suit like
strength-based leadership development is
like you have a certain strength you
should like let that shine at the
workplace if your if your strength is
not sort of margin performance but
that's your CFO strength let them own
that conversation let like let them do
that and so I I think Founders need to
be kind of careful about sort of you
know um I'm going to be a different
person I'm going to use to be a very
different person um the reality is most
people are going to like unlock higher
levels of performance number one by
knowing what's expected of me so that I
can I can overachieve so I know what's
expected of me so so now I know I know
what sort of what I have an idea I have
an idea on something I'm gonna go push
this idea I'm G to try and drive this
impact and my discretionary output is
coming from some intrinsic
motivation and so it it's much more like
likely that for many people it's going
to have to come from within I just know
what's expected boss has been clear but
if you as a manager know what someone's
motivators are you probably know more of
what to do but buttons to push to help
that person get to the next level
performance versus you know being hard
with them or versus you know taking
something away versus being sort of
strict or something you know which is
unlikely to to create some gamechanging
performance for your company yeah I I
agree the consistency is going to be
important right so the last thing I'll
say and I'll let Nolan shift us but in
good times or bad right that inventure
that brand of that founder that brand of
that CPO right I mean you're very well
known for empathy and holistic I mean
that will follow you and the market will
go back up at some point so that thrash
is very dangerous and to think through
that for the long term is important yeah
just to piggy back off that I feel like
a lot of Founders right now are
forgetting that their recruiting brand
is always at stake
and like even though you may not be
hiring right now if your business does
well you will start hiring again and I
think people have very long memories on
some of these topics which like actually
kind of brings me over to comp so we've
been talking about performance and I
just want to get your take on like tying
comp to Performance in today's world I
think there's a lot of companies right
now who are surprised that the comp data
has not dropped as much as they would
have expected um CA just put out a bunch
of data recently it does look like base
salaries have come down a little bit
Equity as it relates to early stage
companies is down pretty significantly
which I think is is somewhat surprising
how are you thinking about comp and how
are you advising on compensation right
now so our compensation strategy really
um is about almost entirely allocating
it to high performance I don't know if
that's right for every company and it's
like I I think every All Hands I've had
to answer this question
um you know the past past two All Hands
past two or three I think it's Unique
because I think in general there's um
there's a sort of like everyone gets
everything approach we're we're kind of
sightly sort of amending it but like we
want to make everyone happy for us at
least we have um a very difficult path
that we've just been on we have like
really meaningful growth that we think
is coming up we think that there's a
there's a small like cohort of of
individuals in the company they having
like outsized impact we want to reward
them like we know that in general Merit
Cycles have been you get 3% and if
you're crushing it you get 4 and a half%
and it's like what there's nothing here
that you're doing anything for anyone
you know that is anything to do with a
performance reward for people and so um
at least for us right now um for you
know we'll see how it Happ we'll see how
it all pans out we're trying to really
reward high performance uh for people
having outsize impact on the company
it's kind of you know like if you read
instacart's S1 it's it's kind of that's
the spirit of it and it's the spirit of
what many public companies try and tell
their shareholders but we're we're
trying to make it really happen like in
a in a real way so and I don't know if
that's right like how aggressive yeah
like how how like what like how like
what percentage of the population is
considered a high performer and are you
saying that like if you're just meeting
expectations you should not expect an
increase yeah yeah and and so like and
this is like a wo like moment I think
for many people but like our average
tenure is about a year many of us are
still learning in our jobs you know like
I haven't hit a year yet I'm not
expecting anything um you know many
early stage startups like how much of
track record have you built at the
company what have you been able to do so
far you know and so your experience in
perform in Performance Cycle is about
learning how you're doing what's
expected of me what could crushing it
really look like and so I I want to make
sure you're not expecting anything like
the the idea idea of battling
entitlements at the
company um or any any startup it's it's
out there you know your entitlement is
out there and so what should I expect
don't expect anything don't expect
anything expect that you're going to
learn how you're doing and there's a
path for you we believe everyone can
crush it we believe you're not going to
be here if we don't think that you have
the like you know potential to actually
perform at a little bit higher level you
get to this everyone can get to
exceeding performance level and so it
might be Year One might be year two it
it might be at some point and when you
when you do it we want it to be really
meaningful and so you so you've you've
been rewarded and we we've learned
you've learned what that high
performance is like and so yeah so if
you're meeting expectations you're
you're getting a good feedback session
with your
boss I think that is that is new and if
people don't like it they can vote with
their feet I I'm telling you that this
is HR Heretics is the title of this
podcast that that is something that is I
think shifted very quickly like
literally within a cycle um this year is
that meets is the new nothing not that
you're bad and that's a that's a nuanced
thing to to talk about that Meats isn't
bad but don't expect it and I agree with
it but that is new so give give me one
click deeper here I'm fascinated by this
topic so say we identify the top
performers and say a a manager has two
or three on their team how much
discretion are you giving that manager
to like say like you know do they have
do they have a slush fund that they that
they can allocate however they wish or
is it like hey the model produces like
this amount of increase for each person
and you lock them in like how do you
guys think about discretion versus the
model we we're we're giving the judgment
to to the manager and then their their
their boss kind of aligns with them uh
you know like there could be a little
bit of things that are thrown out of
whack on internal parody but like in
general we're we're giving them there's
not a budget so it's not a use it or
lose it it's a sort of like we we say
hey we think this is what meaningful
means it's a lot more than an average
you know salary increase year over year
average startup salary budget it's a lot
more than that here's here's here's what
we would recommend and it's a starting
point um but we allow them to plug it in
and there's not a budget there's not a
sort of like ah I don't have enough
dollars for this High performer over
here it's a it's plug in um on the coms
so right so like disproportionately
rewarding top performers I think is like
what Founders have been talking about
and asking for and it sounds like you
guys are actually starting to deliver
that how do you make sure that the
manager is delivering the right message
to that top performer to make sure that
they feel it because it's one thing to
say like Hey we're doing this it's a
whole other thing to be in the seat
receiving it like how do you make sure
that they know that they're that they're
a top
performer there's a couple different
touch points I think there's the
calibration touch Point um there is
hearing it from other leaders like
here's the impact we ask we ask for
clarity when you go through the
calibration and and we sort of pull out
a few High performers what was the
impact what did they do and then
sometimes when it feels like it sounds
like you're just saying they worked hard
but I don't understand what the impact
was I no doubt they worked hard but I
don't know if that's high performance ah
okay that's good clarification this
person over here had a game-changing
effect on on sales funnel conversion
like they they did they shipped this
thing and no one asked them to do that
and like that's kind of what we want to
see right we want to see people sort of
leaning in and sort of fix the problems
that we have and like no one asked them
to do it that's gamechanging impact and
so then they get to hear that in the in
the feedback cycle from their other from
their other leaders from their next
level boss but the business partners so
I have I have a couple of really amazing
business partners who are digging into
this they're reading it they're reading
the feedback they're sitting down
they're sitting down to coach more
Junior managers it's it's a huge role
for the business partner however many
you have it's a huge role for them and
I'm I'm I sort of you know toot my own
horn of my business partners I got a
couple of really good business partners
who who get this part of their their
impact with their teams they
support yeah we we literally had for
that top Echelon the CEO wrapped their
arms around these people it could be
literally a note to their house or an
email or an iners or a 15 minute Zoom um
anything to kind of come over the top
and piggyback on that great feedback um
that that that subjective qualitative
touch was something that it's it was
really important so I I love that one of
the things that I learned uh when I was
at Google and it was kind of like the on
the hush hush streets is that there used
to be this notion of a Founder Grant and
so like like for the the really top
desile performers Not only would they
get like all the comp and the praise but
then they'd get like a specific grant
that was from the founders Like Larry
and Sergey had signed off on that was
obviously like you know huge and that
made them feel great but also the notion
that it can't like Larry and ser signed
off on this thing and so I love that
idea of like making those people feel
super special because that's how you
tuck them in and that's how you continue
to get the type of performance from them
and then hopefully from everyone else
they see that and they're like I want to
be like that person let's transition
into advice for Founders so one of the
questions Kelly and I get all the time
from Founders is around Chief people
officers Founders don't know what to
expect and so like I'm curious from your
lens how do you assess a people
leader um yeah I think um I think about
a people leader is doing really well
they're balancing three things which is
um strategy execution and
relationships and um I think some
leaders some people leaders um have a
maybe have a brand of or they have like
their strength is in one of those um
they are a people person and so maybe
the founder has decided I'm putting you
in in that role because you've shown the
greatest Knack at our culture and
insight on that and um however they
struggle to sort of think about the
strategy is uh for people at this stage
in our in our maturation of the company
and how the pieces have to fit together
to pull that strategy off um
relationships part U so strategy
relationship and execution execution is
can I actually do the work in involved
in the strategy do I know how to
actually um stagger these how do I how
do I prioritize these things so we can
do these
effectively and so I think you're trying
to assess your people leader are they
right for you at this stage of your
company um in terms of their competency
of being able to do all three things and
and knowing when to switch I might have
to start with building trust so that's
relationships orientation I'm going to
start my time now with the company on
building trust and and sort of
stakeholder you know kind of like inputs
like you know kind of do a road show
understand what are different needs what
do what is the conflict
what is sort of different opinions that
are diverging um on the people team
right now and kind of what we're doing
build that trust then move into um
execution on near-term stuff before I
get to the strategy level I need to get
I need to execute on the Performance
Cycle on the comp cycle just to build
some of the trust from the leaders
who've been burned by their people
leader in the past and then finally I
can enter this strategy conversation I
can sort of talk about what I think our
next year plan should be what some big
things some big rocks that we should be
pulling on
and how those are going to have to be
done with the leadership team as opposed
to just me in
isolation um so I I think those I think
a good people leader has to balance all
three things um and much of it is about
co-ownership of people in culture with
the rest of leadership team as opposed
to owning it fully and um that's another
thing that I think is important for for
a good people
leader yeah David you just said burned
by the people ler in the past right and
I'm not saying this is the case for
every company but it does happen What
are the main situations you've seen when
a new people leader is coming in to kind
of clean up a mess what what what has
usually happened what is underneath that
and how does that new people leader turn
that ship around if that makes sense
where do people leaders fail like where
do you see people leaders fail and then
how like if you are coming in how do you
get that that ship back on the right
track and what do you hear oh the the
other people waer did this or didn't do
this I mean what are those big buckets
of of things that go wrong um I I when I
when I was um when I started talking
with some Founders um it was uh probably
about last summer when I was coming off
my my sabatical I started talk I was
wound up talking with a lot of different
Founders and and half of them were the
situation of the prior people leader
didn't work out you know um for whatever
reason um they were exited you know or
they they left and it was not a good
situation or whatever um a lot of it was
just a
misalignment um some some misalignment
in where they were spending our time and
where we were seeing the impact a
misalignment around also what we wanted
from our people leader so this person
was comfortable being behind the scenes
and like not being an open and sort of
upfront people leader they didn't want
it they didn't want any air time at the
All Hands they didn't want to spend time
you know they were in the office but
they didn't want to spend time with
people so there was a disconnection the
misalignment was disconnection with the
workforce the misalignment was
disconnection with the board the
misalignment was they really had the
trust of the
employees but but they just could not
get aligned with what we wanted as an
executive team and so misalignment is
usually the core of it and sort of like
they had some alignment on something but
there was something else there that was
broken and it's tough it's tough for
people leaders because you're balancing
all all these different interests how do
I have trust and respect and credibility
with the employees but not but not be
sort of seen as like at odds with the
executive team how do I have trust line
with the executive team but but not be
seen as just a company person you know
and like I'm not sort of the rest of the
like the Russian Workforce don't like I
don't get them you know and so that's a
balancing act um that at the root of it
Miss some level of misalignment was the
issue for the people leader who was no
longer there I I could not agree more I
mean at this point I talk to Founders a
lot and it's it's less about whe whether
that HR leader is good or bad
functionally it's more of the fit
without organization right it kind of
aching us all toqua crayons and we're
all crayons there's different colors you
got to find the right color that fits
that culture otherwise it's just gonna
miss so I agree with you that it is hard
David what what do you do to stay
aligned because you mentioned the
competing interests so like typically
like the founder has you know some
things the employees have a lot of
things the board has some things the
leadership team has other things like
there are so many parties to navigate as
a cheap people officer like how do you
how do you make sure that you're in
alignment with all of those competing
interests and stay
sane yeah it's a it's a good question so
so number one it's not about it's not
about boiling it down to something that
like no one would disagree with right
it's not about out it's not about
meeting everyone's needs all all at the
same time um but there is some level of
of trust so I need to be um trust and
probably trust and respect um you you
might not might not like like what I'm
focusing on but I trust it because
you've been highly communicative with us
I I I respect it because you can share
the context you can share the why why
are we doing this now why are we not
doing this now and so that trust and
respect is I mean that the core of that
is a relationship that you that you
can't build with everyone in the company
but that I can get out there I can get
out there as much as I possibly can so
when I go to Tel Aviv you know you ask
me anything I really want people to ask
me all the tough questions and I I don't
want to not Dodge any questions um I
want to be able to spend time with you
know whoever is influential in the
office who like gets the culture I want
to go out and ask them questions I want
to learn from them I want to be I want
to be lean with curiosity
um I don't think that I'm going to win
any um win any sort of trust and respect
competitions by just being didactic I
really need to ask questions and root
out and make sure I understand what's
going on in the workforce you get some
of that through engagement survey
results you get a lot of that through
conversations and so I think in moments
in my career where I feel like I have
been disconnected like I've been missing
something because I've been too
comfortable with my team it's been like
I haven't gotten out there I haven't
talked with leaders I haven't thought
out the people people who oppose the
people team or sought out the people who
are critics of the people team sought
out like sought out the dysfunction and
really immersed myself in it so I try
and run to I try and run to the tough
stuff you know wherever it's happening
in the company and and and understand it
so that that I can speak to it credibly
this is why we're not doing this now
this is why we are doing this now um so
that why that context I think um I I had
I had a good a business partner show
told me the other day was talking
through a compensation cycle approach
she's like you missed the why like all
this is good stuff but there should have
just been a slide on the why I'm like oh
my gosh um thank you for calling that
out so anyways I I love the idea of
running
towards the the folks that are are not
in agreement with your philosophy or
your strategy or or made feel like a
little bit slided in some way it's one
of my bigger learnings being in the role
is that it's so easy to to anchor on the
people that agree with you and that see
your way of the world but actually like
it's it's less about winning them over
and more about like making sure that
they feel heard and understand why we
are doing things if I could go back I
think that that's probably one of my
biggest regrets in my last job is that I
didn't spend enough time with the people
who disagreed with our approach and
philosophy because it's just it feels
way safer to hang out with the people
that agree with us yeah and to your
point on the why it's it's just talking
to them like a human right like I don't
care if it's me to an SDR or me to a
board member again that that reputation
that consistency of I'm G to just talk
to you simple here's why here's why not
you might not like this but here's the
deal and and that that reputation
spreads like wildfire especially with
the detractors right you you connect
with a detractor they're going to tell
 
going to maybe tell five so could not
agree more with both of you and I I I
think what another thing that's I think
that's been particularly helpful for me
in my current stint is I've just been
really deeply curious about the business
how it works like immerse myself you
know the cliche is like be a business
leader first and you know sort of your
people strategy second like understand
what the business needs are like hugely
helpful for me and like earlier in my
career I like some some like the SDR
function sales sales funnel conversion
performance whatever like just eyes
glaze over earlier in my career and now
like I'm super curious about it and I
can speak credibly to the current state
of the business because I can quickly
connect to people stuff in terms of why
back to the business anyways do you have
advice for those folks that are trying
to get into that number one seat for the
first time and having a hard time doing
it I'm literally talking to three right
now that are banging their head against
the wall because they want the CPO role
and all they're hearing is we want
someone who's done it
before um part of what I would say is um
one of my most miserable experiences in
my career was my first head of people
role
um it's it's no longer even on my my
resume I just made a huge mistake I
thought I wanted something for a
particular
reason and I I just like it wasn't it
wasn't what I wanted at all and so I
think that there's a desire early on I
got I need that top job I need this for
some reason and um in terms in terms of
like the patience to get there in the
right in the right situation with the
right person who's going to grow you cuz
like when you're when your first time
head of people
you're still learning and the reality is
many CEOs don't have time to develop you
like like like CEOs are sometimes the
worst bosses when you think about like
I'm going to develop you in my career I
want I want a boss who's going to
develop me and like give me feedback and
like uhuh you're not like the CEO
doesn't have time for that and so when I
deeply want that as my sort of career
Milestone I got to be ahead of people
that might be the last time you're going
to get the type of feedback that you
want to get and so you know in terms of
your patience to sort of like that right
Situation's going to manifest itself at
the right time um I think some of the
best people leaders I know took them a
while it took them a while to get to
that job and and suddenly the first job
was CPO of an amazing company and they
were in for 20 years doing something
underneath someone else and now they're
doing phenomenally whereas you know I
was itching at it like 10 years in I
need to get it I'm like eight 10 years
of my career I need this job and like
and then I flounder and then I'm like
man I wish I I don't have the I don't
have the development experience any
don't have the person developing me
anymore I kind of want to get back to
that I've had that conversation where
someone's like I think I need to go back
to a number two job I need to go back to
someone I need to go under a CPO at a
public company who's going to develop me
because I'm missing so much so um you
know that might not be the answer that
that they would want to hear but I would
I would encourage like you know patience
and just sort of like find that mode and
like you know like wait for the perfect
opportunity to to surface and David when
you are in the top job as you are right
now as you mentioned like most CEOs
aren't great bosses like I'm I'm
terrible I know that I've experienced
that in the past like you just don't
learn you're not learning about your
craft from the CEO how do you continue
to learn like what what are your
resources what are you doing like how do
you continue to stay sharp in your game
you know I think um at this point in my
career a lot of the fun and a lot of the
sort of like man every day is a new
learning is seeing how the executive
team works together along with the board
and what is the board focusing on and um
how do we get through this board meeting
in a way that creates better alignment
on the business itself what are the
pieces here what must be true of talent
for us to get to that place in that that
sort of fiscal year plan uh six months
from now um a lot of it is that
executive Team Dynamics I'm working with
Founders working with the board um and
then the business plan how can I have a
big impact on the business plan I think
I I think I kind of know we get through
this Performance Cycle stuff we'll get
through this engagement survey stuff
like I've done that before but how are
we going to make the business work um on
on you know relative to all things
people in town constantly learning on
that no shortage of learnings last
question for you David is how you stay
aligned with the founder um you've
worked for generational Founders uh
Founders I I I think are all over the
place generally I am now one uh we have
a million things going on in our mind
often times that
you know we get information uh I think
very quickly that the chief people
officer doesn't get just from their seat
and operating internally with the
founder operating a lot of externally
how do you stay aligned with
 
Founders um that's a good question I
think part of it
was um selecting out in the interview
process I think those who are just
probably was not going to just wasn't
going to work you know um probably half
the battle there is like are we like
when times are tough do I feel as though
that we'll be able to work through stuff
like we communicate in a way where we
understand each other like there's a
respect there we kind of know what we're
what we're going to be looking for from
each other there's there's alignment
there as much as possible at the
beginning I've been part I've been I've
been paired with a Founder in the past
where I just realized almost immediately
I made a mistake and um it was going to
be intensely hard to get alignment
around the initiatives and like I just
like wow I just I misread this person
and so I think with with um Romy and IAI
the founders of flare I think I just
spent enough quality time with them in
the beginning like I got them I got why
they why they care about the business I
got how they like to operate I got like
where they are going to spend their time
where they're not going to spend their
time um you know as co-founders what
what will I lean on this one for versus
this thing over here um and then as much
as possible meeting them with their
communication style like I'll just I'll
give you one example early on I my last
company we were trained to have a
document for every possible change in
the company like almost like call it
like a run a show document any possible
change like there's an or change here's
the change over here um it's just how
they rolled at my prior company and I
quickly saw that there was a much more
loose approach to planning on a big
changes you know my current company it
was just more more start upy I guess um
and so I adapted you know I've tried to
meet them where they're at on how they
like to communicate and how they like to
roll with things and how they like to
keep things certain things simple
whereas my prior company we complicated
things so um you know but I was
fortunate that I think I got a lot of it
just from from the way I approached the
interview so David thanks so much for
the time I learned a ton from this uh I
know our listeners are gonna love it too
same thanks so much David it's awesome
