Hey everyone, welcome back to the show.
Hope you're all doing well. It's Monday
here. Nolan and I are kicking off with a
couple segments, Dear Heretics segments.
Thank you all for keeping these coming.
We have a log of these and they are
incredible. So, please DM us with more
things you want us to kick around and
dig through. So, Nolan, we have a
question here around 360s. You ready for
this one? I'm ready. All right. Dear
heretics, can you talk a little bit
about your experience with 360 reviews,
specifically as a manager trying to
digest them and then give feedback to
your direct report? I have tons and tons
of written feedback to sift through and
it can be paralyzing. Any advice on
this? Okay. So, like I've had 360s done
really well and then I've had 360s done
I would describe it as like haphazard
and
halfass. And so, let me just talk about
the characteristics of the ones that are
done really well. So, the first thing is
like there's time to do it and the
person who is doing it for me wants to
do it, right? Like you have to start
from that spot because if you don't have
time or if you don't want to do it,
you're faking it and it's going to show
up in the work. And not only is it not
going to be received well, it's not
going to be appreciated and the person's
going to know it's not coming from a
place of like you're actually trying to
help me, which is really what the goal
of this thing is. So the best one I had
done, it's so simple. like this is not
boiling the ocean, but my manager came
to me first and said, "Hey, you know,
it's been a bit since we've gotten you
feedback. It's been like six to nine
months. I want to do a 360. Here's how
I'm going to do the process. I'm going
to reach out to these people and I'm
going to ask them, what does Nolan do
well that you want him to do more
of? And what is Nolan currently doing
that you want him to stop or do less
of?" Super simple, two questions, right?
This isn't like a you know 17page survey
right I think that's another failure
mode start just doing that and then when
the person goes they ask these people
live actually which I find is way better
than you know doing some form submission
because you're able to ask follow-up
questions you're able to read body
language see if there's something
beneath the surface there and then when
it's delivered to me it's delivered
thematically so like here's the themes
of what's going well and here's like a
couple supporting details and And here's
the themes of what your team and I as
your manager because the manager has to
agree with it want you to either do less
of or to
stop and here's the impact it's having
on people or on the business. I don't
think that's some like complicated
thing, Kelly. And often actually in that
situation it was not delivered in
writing. So I think a lot of times like
we're just trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] document
everything and like like I was a top
performer like he's not trying to manage
me out and so there's no reason to
codify this thing because codification
takes time. So that was what worked out
well for us. Yeah. So first of all I
love the five to 10 minute chats. Like
yes we have the systems. I actually do
think there is value in having the
written, but where I can get it, I will
always kind of meet the written with a 5
to seven minute talk or I won't even be
like, "Listen, don't write anything
down. Let's just talk for 5 to seven
minutes cuz I can get so much nuance.
It's a two-way dialogue." So, I can dig
in deeper, ask a couple more questions.
We all know that Slacks, texts, they
suck. like you don't get unless you
follow up you don't really you know
understand fully so I will do that I
will say hey 10 people five people get
give me 10 minutes and they love it too
like so many more people have accepted
doing it because they're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I
don't have to write a book you know
that's the one of the main reasons why
people decline 360 reviews because like
oh I already have eight I can't do
anymore
but the talking is wonderful now I do
like the writing as well And I will
we'll talk about how I've done this over
the years because I do think it's worked
well at least for me if it's helpful on
the digesting like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of
feedback. And the first thing I do is
print them all out. I literally don't
work on screens with this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever
because I can't critically think about
the feedback and digest it. So I will
print it all out for each person. And
then I will sit down and I will start to
read each
one. And I basically take a piece of
paper next to the printout and I'll
write down themes, right? Uh
actionoriented, thoughtful and
approachable, you know, whatever it is.
And then as I come across that theme
again, I'll put like a tally mark next
to the theme. And I'll make sure that
everything is represented, try to, you
know, cluster them just like a feedback
session, like cluster them in as least
amount of buckets as possible. But I
will tally the strength of how often
that theme showed up in all the 360s and
then I will write that. I'll say listen
this 360 feedback doesn't have to be
long is the result of me going
meticulously through conversations or
written and it is actually weighted. is
in order of the strength of what came up
and then I will coales that with my
feedback and my observations and usually
unless you're in outer space or
something's wildly off like they have a
lot of overlaps. So then I can come up
with examples or ideas that connect to
that feedback and mine and they know it
wasn't some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like copy paste job
because I went through and the waiting
actually made people pay attention to it
and I mean we ei whatever it is like
reading these are the strengths of where
these showed up they actually leaned
into it and we talked about it a lot. It
was it was great. So that's what I do
just to kind of make it that's a cool
idea. Yeah, I like that. Hey everyone,
we'll be right back in a moment after a
word from our
sponsors. Your workforce is your
organization's greatest strength and
often its largest single expense. But

more. I must admit, I used to believe
that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR. That is until my
friend Heather Doce, who leads talent at
Signal Fire, told me to check out
Metave. I got into the product and was
like, "Wow, AI actually does exist in
recruiting." And this product is sick.
Metaview is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for
recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metaview changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. Metivview covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora and check out
MeteView. Head over to
metaviv.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metabuse's product experts. Tell them
that me and Kelly sent you. Or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in minutes.
You know, the other thing too is we're
operating in the era of AI. And so,
like, say I'm back at Door Dash and I
think I had, you know, something like
eight direct reports at the time. And I
also have like a gigantic job. That is
like my first priority. And it's
performance review season again. And
like I got to summarize all this
feedback first and then figure out how
to deliver it. There's literally not a
world to where I'm not literally
starting with like, okay, Kelly's
feedback and then I'm dropping all of
the raw data into chat GPT and I'm
saying pull out the themes for me. Like
I'm starting there in today's world. The
other thing with AI today, you know, S
and I talked about this in one of our AI
corners, but like one of my favorite
tools is called Whisper Flow. So, the
thing for me, and this isn't for
everybody, but I think it's for most
people, is that we talk way faster than
we type. And we think when we talk
versus I don't think well when I'm
typing. I think better when I'm writing.
And so using a tool like this, basically
what it does, it's what Siri should have
been. It actually can hear my voice and
do bullets and do all these things to
where like I can think without having to
type. And that has enabled me to get my
thoughts out of my brain so much faster.
Now, there's still an editing process
after the fact that needs to happen to
make sure I'm cleaning [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. But
like, there's nothing worse in my
opinion when you're doing like a 360 and
you're just sitting and you're staring
at the blank screen and the cursor
flashing at you and it's like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
like I got to go create Mona Lisa right
now. Yeah. It's brutal. It's brutal.
It's the worst. And so like this is why
these tools exist now, right? Because
other people have these problems. And so
if you're not leveraging these, you're a
glutton for punishment. Yeah. I mean,
the AI thing was on my list. I'll admit
I've been a little reluctant because I
just I don't think it's to the point yet
where it would capture as much nuance as
I would capture reading through it
because I know the 360 reviewers. I know
the person. I feel like I can get to
Shades of Gray better, at least for
now. But you're right. We have to start
trying it and understanding even if we
have to go back and blah blah blah. But
I do like to write things down, Nolan,
because it helps me solidify it more in
my head. But that whisper flow sounds
really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool. I mean, that's like
you can write a book without having to
write it. You know, you're just talking.
Kelly, it's so incredible. like I'm
using it like the amount of time I well
I won't because I think it's gonna be a
commodity. So like you know this is
going to be like one of those things
that in 10 years they're gonna be like
they use
keyboards. But honestly it's so good and
I think the rule for me is the moment I
start feeling
overwhelmed is the moment I think about
AI. Like I'm training my brain to where
it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I feel overwhelmed. It's
like okay what AI tool exists to help me
with this? I think what people miss with
this is like it's not to get to the
final output, right? It's to get from
the zero yard line into the red zone,
right? Just like let's move the ball
down the field here, right? Like we'll
drop the touchdown play in a second, but
like we got to at least first move the
ball and get a couple first downs. And
that's where I think AI is super
helpful. The sports analogies. Sorry
folks. Sorry. Sometimes I apologize for
him. It's the best. And I agree with
that. You're saying to use AI to escape
the mind [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of the blank page with the
cursor staring at you. The cold start
problem. Yeah, just to get some
movement. And I agree with that. What
I've heard out there, which I think is
the worst, is when you don't put any of
your brain into this. Oh my god. You
should manage people. You shouldn't even
be the person to honestly if you are
that person and you're just running
everything through it and like here you
go. The next thing you should do is you
should go to your boss and say like, "I
shouldn't manage people anymore." I just
literally did this without thinking. And
some folks, you know, will just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
copy and paste the form, put it in the
review verbatim and say, "Do you have
any questions?" It's like, dude, a lot I
have a lot. It's It's not the majority.
I think the majority of people though
have this cold start problem to where
it's like, okay, great. You know, the
people team signed us up to do these
 
Now it's my job to like have to go do
and like oh by the way I have a real job
you know Mr. or Mrs. head of HR thanks
for giving me more responsibility. And
guys this is the thing is like if you
can just think about it from the
perspective of we are trying to help
these people grow. The more growth that
these people experience the better off
my life as their manager will be. And so
how do I get this ball rolling? It's a
momentum game. It's like as soon as I
can get the moment and my thoughts start
coming out, then it's like I'm 25
minutes later I'm like, "Oh, that wasn't
that bad." Versus the blank page is the
thing that everyone struggles with.
Totally. And the last thing I'll say,
which is a pro tip, and I've been doing
it for years, is is just start the
momentum and keep it at a nice even clip
all year long. Like don't let the ball
stop and then restart at your end and
then stop. I'm doing it all the time. I
just had, you know, my reviews at
Quizlet for my folks and it was like a
non-event. It was just a continuation.
And so you actually will probably be
able to do less 360s. If you're just not
lazy throughout the year and you're
honest, you're giving feedback. There's
no cursor. There's no blank page. So
actually, I totally agree with you with
an addendum, which is when you have
feedback on somebody, I think there's
two things you should do. One is deliver
it right away. Yes. The second thing is
you should write it. So I had a note for
every single person on my team. Like
literally their own note. And what I
would do is I would like immediately
when something would happen, I would
either deliver the feedback or I'd write
it down and then deliver the feedback
soon. But then when I got to the point
of performance review time, I have this
note cuz like you know at Door Dash we
were living nine lives in a day. Yeah.
That was the joke. And so I just don't
have I don't have the time to like oh my
god go back to all these conversations
and think about stuff like I actually
needed that note to remind me of all of
the feedback that I had given. Yeah,
that's fair. I mean for someone who
doesn't like legal, you throw an
addendum. That's incredible. And I'm
talking about I mean you guys like
literally this isn't like a big process.
Like I saw our CTO in the hallway last
week and I was like hey you have two
minutes. This isn't like a big thing.
This is just the normal course of your
day. I do think you can streamline it in
if you think about it. Yeah. And here's
the other thing. Just last thing on
feedback, which is, you know, not the
total topic segment we're doing here,
but I've been noticing it with some of
the people I've been working with
recently. We want a 5 to one ratio of
positive to constructive. Like I think
people forget that. Like when you see
something you like, like that's
feedback, too. Let people know. And in
fact, the reinforcing feedback sticks
way more than the change behavior
feedback. And so I think most people
people know this, but I think for other
folks that are listening to the show,
it's like when you see something you
like, tell somebody because then they're
going to do more of it. Yeah. And you
know what I learned about constructive
feedback that I did not do well or even
think about and I've been doing it the
past probably like seven years. We tend
to like deliver the feedback. Hey, I
noticed that. Explain why
Like just the other day, this poor team
at Quizlet, love you guys. You guys are
great. But I'm putting them through
gauntlets of like QBRs and all this crap
and they're like, "What's going on?" And
I said, "Look, I know we just went
through this. You got pummeled. Like,
you got pummeled. Here's why I did that.
Here's why this is going to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
great for you. You're going to make it
out the other side." And you just take
it so much differently, you know? So
explaining like the broader context of
why you even care about saying this is
very powerful and I did not do that
enough early on. Yeah. And just like
that, to your point, just like you're
caring about that person and you have
like a bigger picture in mind for them,
right? It's so much easier to take
constructive feedback when it's part of
a bigger game and that like this that
you, Kelly, my manager, have bigger
horizons for me and are helping me get
to that. And why I need this skill and
why it's not going to be the other piece
you just described there too is it's
like a little pain, but every
constructive piece of feedback feels
like ego shattering and world ending,
right? And so when you're able to say,
"Hey, like this is a little pain. Like
go have a glass of wine tonight. You'll
be fine. Nobody's going to even remember
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tomorrow, but like this is why
it's important for you. 100%. That's the
best. Yeah, it's the best. And it's more
fun to give it that way. I mean, God,
totally. Not everything is life and
death. Uh, anything else? That's it. See
you, homies. All right. Bye. HR Heretics
