So, we're excited to have you back on
 
So, we're excited to have you back on
for a bit and dig into some some meaty
 
for a bit and dig into some some meaty
topics. Um, let's kick it off. So,
 
topics. Um, let's kick it off. So,
Brett, first of all, you guys just
 
Brett, first of all, you guys just
raised a $245 million new fund. What the
 
raised a $245 million new fund. What the
hell are you going to do with all that
 
hell are you going to do with all that
capital? Well, one, first of all, it's
 
capital? Well, one, first of all, it's
pretty exciting, right? Because the
 
pretty exciting, right? Because the
majority of venture raises by like seven
 
majority of venture raises by like seven
to 10 firms. And so there's been sort of
 
to 10 firms. And so there's been sort of
this this narrative like these emerging,
 
this this narrative like these emerging,
you know, when you call new funds or
 
you know, when you call new funds or
smaller funds or focused fund emerging
 
smaller funds or focused fund emerging
the the death of the emerging these VCs
 
the the death of the emerging these VCs
are all going to like, you know, peter
 
are all going to like, you know, peter
away. Um and so I think it's reassuring
 
away. Um and so I think it's reassuring
that our LPs and new LPs were like, we
 
that our LPs and new LPs were like, we
really like what Bonfire is doing. Um
 
really like what Bonfire is doing. Um
look, we're going to do what we've
 
look, we're going to do what we've
always done, right? We invest at the
 
always done, right? We invest at the
seed stage. We're going to find great
 
seed stage. We're going to find great
founders, you know, we're going to write
 
founders, you know, we're going to write
sizable checks and do their seed rounds
 
sizable checks and do their seed rounds
and we do classic seeds where there's
 
and we do classic seeds where there's
product and market and there's revenue,
 
product and market and there's revenue,
etc. And, you know, we're going to go
 
etc. And, you know, we're going to go
hands-on, you know, with these founders
 
hands-on, you know, with these founders
and be as supportive as we can be. Um,
 
and be as supportive as we can be. Um,
there's no different. It's the same
 
there's no different. It's the same
thing. There's more money we've got. you
 
thing. There's more money we've got. you
know, that gives us probably an
 
know, that gives us probably an
opportunity to bring on a couple more
 
opportunity to bring on a couple more
people to deploy
 
people to deploy
uh some checks because at some point, if
 
uh some checks because at some point, if
you are as helpful as we are, most
 
you are as helpful as we are, most
seedstage firms roll off at some point.
 
seedstage firms roll off at some point.
So, you're not you're not on everybody's
 
So, you're not you're not on everybody's
board. The challenge with our founders
 
board. The challenge with our founders
when we try to roll off are like, "Dude,
 
when we try to roll off are like, "Dude,
where are you going? No, no, no, no, no.
 
where are you going? No, no, no, no, no.
You need you need to stay here and uh
 
You need you need to stay here and uh
and help sort of guide the company." So,
 
and help sort of guide the company." So,
same thing. I think the big thing really
 
same thing. I think the big thing really
wrestling and thinking that we've always
 
wrestling and thinking that we've always
in invested in application software
 
in invested in application software
companies and I think the big thing you
 
companies and I think the big thing you
know for somebody that's been in
 
know for somebody that's been in
software for 30 years is well what the
 
software for 30 years is well what the
hell is an application software company
 
hell is an application software company
today right since last we spoke it was
 
today right since last we spoke it was
how long ago nine months ago how long
 
how long ago nine months ago how long
was it like 18 months 18 months so I've
 
was it like 18 months 18 months so I've
done a lot of writing on this people can
 
done a lot of writing on this people can
go to my queener substack if you want I
 
go to my queener substack if you want I
basically write when I have a lot of
 
basically write when I have a lot of
anxiety and I can't name that anxiety
 
anxiety and I can't name that anxiety
and then by writing it it's my own
 
and then by writing it it's my own
therapy and then hopefully that helps
 
therapy and then hopefully that helps
others with their anxiety. But in the
 
others with their anxiety. But in the
last 18
 
last 18
months the world has fundamentally
 
months the world has fundamentally
changed in terms of what is a valuable
 
changed in terms of what is a valuable
application software application and
 
application software application and
then what is a
 
then what is a
viable software application company and
 
viable software application company and
so that's kind of exciting. So, I want
 
so that's kind of exciting. So, I want
to talk about that because, you know, to
 
to talk about that because, you know, to
your point, I'm like, oh, it's kind of
 
your point, I'm like, oh, it's kind of
like the same, you know, we're doing the
 
like the same, you know, we're doing the
same stuff, but the world is totally
 
same stuff, but the world is totally
different now. Um, what I'm seeing as
 
different now. Um, what I'm seeing as
I'm also working with preede and seed
 
I'm also working with preede and seed
founders is that there's a ton of hype.
 
founders is that there's a ton of hype.
It's hard to figure out what's real and
 
It's hard to figure out what's real and
what's
 
what's
overpromised. The amount of money going
 
overpromised. The amount of money going
into like a preede company. I just heard
 
into like a preede company. I just heard
yesterday a company raised 20 million on
 
yesterday a company raised 20 million on
a 100 post on an idea. And so I'm like
 
a 100 post on an idea. And so I'm like
it does feel completely different or it
 
it does feel completely different or it
feels like maybe we're repeating some of
 
feels like maybe we're repeating some of
the same mistakes in the you know the
 
the same mistakes in the you know the
part of the 2021 uh era. What's your
 
part of the 2021 uh era. What's your
take on where things are today? Look, I
 
take on where things are today? Look, I
think the market is definitely frothy,
 
think the market is definitely frothy,
especially as it relates to AI native
 
especially as it relates to AI native
companies because those select few that
 
companies because those select few that
get it right, they can grow a lot faster
 
get it right, they can grow a lot faster
um than you know the sort of
 
um than you know the sort of
pre the pre-AII SAS generation of
 
pre the pre-AII SAS generation of
companies.
 
companies.
I think the challenge is some of this
 
I think the challenge is some of this
premium is a bit silly because we're
 
premium is a bit silly because we're
talking about an AI company versus a
 
talking about an AI company versus a
nonAI company and everything's going to
 
nonAI company and everything's going to
be or is soon an AI company. That's like
 
be or is soon an AI company. That's like
saying, you know, 20 years ago, like,
 
saying, you know, 20 years ago, like,
well, the SAS companies got this premium
 
well, the SAS companies got this premium
and the on premise software companies
 
and the on premise software companies
didn't, right? And so I, in my mind,
 
didn't, right? And so I, in my mind,
some of this premium,
 
some of this premium,
um, I think goes away.
 
um, I think goes away.
Um that being said, what is interesting
 
Um that being said, what is interesting
is
 
is
um the potential growth you can have if
 
um the potential growth you can have if
you get it right with this next
 
you get it right with this next
generation of products can be far faster
 
generation of products can be far faster
for a seedstage company than before. And
 
for a seedstage company than before. And
so if we think about Zerp era, the whole
 
so if we think about Zerp era, the whole
thing was like, oh, let's get this thing
 
thing was like, oh, let's get this thing
going. Let's raise the seed. we'll get
 
going. Let's raise the seed. we'll get
to a millionaire R and we'll raise it
 
to a millionaire R and we'll raise it
 
and everything and you don't have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
and everything and you don't have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
at a million dollars and there are those
 
at a million dollars and there are those
companies that scaled but most of them
 
companies that scaled but most of them
prematurely scaled and they raised a
 
prematurely scaled and they raised a
bunch of money and too much money too
 
bunch of money and too much money too
early and they weren't forced into very
 
early and they weren't forced into very
hard difficult constraint decisions
 
hard difficult constraint decisions
um and now you know our general guidance
 
um and now you know our general guidance
at Bonfire we invest is
 
at Bonfire we invest is
that companies should get to at least
 
that companies should get to at least
three million in revenue with received
 
three million in revenue with received
state financing at least a full cycle
 
state financing at least a full cycle
year on retention and churn and in fact
 
year on retention and churn and in fact
my recent ones that I've been investing
 
my recent ones that I've been investing
in I'm almost saying let's get to five
 
in I'm almost saying let's get to five
why can't you get to five and the reason
 
why can't you get to five and the reason
I say this and it's not this is the
 
I say this and it's not this is the
person that wrote the article that said
 
person that wrote the article that said
triple triple double double was
 
triple triple double double was
misguided for
 
misguided for
many but what is possible with AI
 
many but what is possible with AI
software products if they're not viby or
 
software products if they're not viby or
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] There was an interesting
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] There was an interesting
article published yesterday around the
 
article published yesterday around the
AISDR company that perhaps wasn't doing
 
AISDR company that perhaps wasn't doing
as well. I want to talk to you about
 
as well. I want to talk to you about
that as one thought which I'm
 
that as one thought which I'm
not I wasn't surprised by that because I
 
not I wasn't surprised by that because I
had yet to find a successful deployment
 
had yet to find a successful deployment
of an AISDR tool anywhere right the
 
of an AISDR tool anywhere right the
reality the issue we had using outreach
 
reality the issue we had using outreach
and sales loft was we took marketing we
 
and sales loft was we took marketing we
took messaging from marketing who cared
 
took messaging from marketing who cared
about what you were saying in email
 
about what you were saying in email
marketing and we handed it to 22-y old
 
marketing and we handed it to 22-y old
lax bros and they send you sequences
 
lax bros and they send you sequences
like dude are you breaking up with me
 
like dude are you breaking up with me
like that was the way for me to engage
 
like that was the way for me to engage
in sequence three and then we just
 
in sequence three and then we just
automated that. So like if you automate
 
automated that. So like if you automate
stupidity, you're going to get turns out
 
stupidity, you're going to get turns out
not better results. Um, put that aside.
 
not better results. Um, put that aside.
But if you deliver a product to somebody
 
But if you deliver a product to somebody
with
 
with
AI and when I think about AI and I write
 
AI and when I think about AI and I write
a lot about this is that if I really
 
a lot about this is that if I really
think about my career and the
 
think about my career and the
applications that I've been involved
 
applications that I've been involved
with I was an executive at Sevil which
 
with I was an executive at Sevil which
was its most the fastest growing company
 
was its most the fastest growing company
in the on-remise era and then Salesforce
 
in the on-remise era and then Salesforce
the fastest growing company in the
 
the fastest growing company in the
ondemand
 
ondemand
world. The products didn't fundamentally
 
world. The products didn't fundamentally
change. There were CRUD databases where
 
change. There were CRUD databases where
like you enter data in and then maybe
 
like you enter data in and then maybe
you pulled data out. The problem with
 
you pulled data out. The problem with
the cloud is APIs and integrations were
 
the cloud is APIs and integrations were
easy. It was easy to go customize. So
 
easy. It was easy to go customize. So
you're using one app that somebody was
 
you're using one app that somebody was
customizing every 30 days and changing
 
customizing every 30 days and changing
and then for a given role you were using
 
and then for a given role you were using
nine apps to do your job. So, you're
 
nine apps to do your job. So, you're
just trying to get your job done and you
 
just trying to get your job done and you
have these nine crud apps that you're
 
have these nine crud apps that you're
hunting and pecking across and none of
 
hunting and pecking across and none of
them actually make you better at your
 
them actually make you better at your
job and none of them actually help you
 
job and none of them actually help you
do your job. They might inform you,
 
do your job. They might inform you,
there might be analytics, etc. But like
 
there might be analytics, etc. But like
being that much more effective, getting
 
being that much more effective, getting
time back, etc., isn't true. And what's
 
time back, etc., isn't true. And what's
very interesting when I think broadly of
 
very interesting when I think broadly of
the AI opportunity is that for the first
 
the AI opportunity is that for the first
time we're bringing intelligence and
 
time we're bringing intelligence and
reasoning into a product where a
 
reasoning into a product where a
product more closely approximates what
 
product more closely approximates what
if you could hire a super clever person
 
if you could hire a super clever person
who worked 24 by7 and didn't say
 
who worked 24 by7 and didn't say
negative things about you in glass door
 
negative things about you in glass door
and asked you what parts of your job
 
and asked you what parts of your job
they could do for you and made you more
 
they could do for you and made you more
effective. If you deliver that product
 
effective. If you deliver that product
to people and they look at
 
to people and they look at
it, you know, and I I call it the what
 
it, you know, and I I call it the what
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] moment. Prospects look at that
 
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] moment. Prospects look at that
and go, "Wait a minute. Does that work?
 
and go, "Wait a minute. Does that work?
That can't work." And you're like, "No,
 
That can't work." And you're like, "No,
it does work." And if it actually does
 
work, there's far less a if you really
 
work, there's far less a if you really
think about the last 30 years of a
 
think about the last 30 years of a
playbook I would give somebody, you
 
playbook I would give somebody, you
know, and Kelly's seen me in board
 
know, and Kelly's seen me in board
meetings where Brett has an answer on
 
meetings where Brett has an answer on
marketing or SDR or success or account
 
marketing or SDR or success or account
managers or hunter farmer doesn't make
 
managers or hunter farmer doesn't make
sense.
 
sense.
All of that mess that you need to manage
 
All of that mess that you need to manage
and get
 
and get
right is directly
 
right is directly
tied to how much friction there is
 
tied to how much friction there is
between the product you've sold and the
 
between the product you've sold and the
value somebody
 
value somebody
gets. And these next generation of
 
gets. And these next generation of
agentic products actually add a ton of
 
agentic products actually add a ton of
value. So like how many sees do I need?
 
value. So like how many sees do I need?
How many like value selling playbooks?
 
How many like value selling playbooks?
What ROI calculator? like, do I need 30
 
What ROI calculator? like, do I need 30
CSMs to go in and be like, oh, you're
 
CSMs to go in and be like, oh, you're
red, yellow, or green, and you're not
 
red, yellow, or green, and you're not
really taking advantage of this product?
 
really taking advantage of this product?
Like, does this product work or doesn't?
 
Like, does this product work or doesn't?
And so, what I'm saying is if you can
 
And so, what I'm saying is if you can
build a product like that, it actually
 
build a product like that, it actually
delivers real value, you can grow a lot
 
delivers real value, you can grow a lot
faster. Um, and you can sit in product
 
faster. Um, and you can sit in product
market fit land with smaller groups of
 
market fit land with smaller groups of
teams.
 
teams.
Um, with without having to go like raise
 
Um, with without having to go like raise
the money and go hire 20 salespeople and
 
the money and go hire 20 salespeople and
then look at a ramp model and you look
 
then look at a ramp model and you look
at it on spreadsheet and it works, but
 
at it on spreadsheet and it works, but
it rarely does out of the gate, right?
 
it rarely does out of the gate, right?
Because that's what you think you need
 
Because that's what you think you need
to grow. So, you know, look, it's
 
to grow. So, you know, look, it's
definitely hypy right now. There's a lot
 
definitely hypy right now. There's a lot
of money being thrown around. Um, I
 
of money being thrown around. Um, I
think we're repeating the mistakes of
 
think we're repeating the mistakes of
the past.
 
the past.
Uh but what we try to do is really go
 
Uh but what we try to do is really go
look and figure out is this a
 
look and figure out is this a
founder who is world class who is
 
founder who is world class who is
maniacal who is going to work at the
 
maniacal who is going to work at the
pace and speed that it's required now.
 
pace and speed that it's required now.
And do they have a unique insight around
 
And do they have a unique insight around
a customer problem that they're sitting
 
a customer problem that they're sitting
in that their customers are giving them
 
in that their customers are giving them
the license to basically deliver as much
 
the license to basically deliver as much
software as that customer wants as
 
software as that customer wants as
quickly as possible. Um, and if you can
 
quickly as possible. Um, and if you can
find that, we can build interesting
 
find that, we can build interesting
companies. Hey Brett, do you care? I
 
companies. Hey Brett, do you care? I
mean, do you do you accent or bias more
 
mean, do you do you accent or bias more
on firsttime founders or repeat founders
 
on firsttime founders or repeat founders
where they've done this, they've
 
where they've done this, they've
learned, they're coachable, you you have
 
learned, they're coachable, you you have
more confidence in that. Do you do you
 
more confidence in that. Do you do you
care one way or the other based on your
 
care one way or the other based on your
experience? I think the AI moment makes
 
experience? I think the AI moment makes
that question a harder one to answer.
 
that question a harder one to answer.
I definitely like people that have done
 
I definitely like people that have done
startups before whether they were super
 
startups before whether they were super
successful or failure and they learned
 
successful or failure and they learned
about the mistakes they made as
 
about the mistakes they made as
leaders. Um if somebody has built
 
leaders. Um if somebody has built
successful companies um there are things
 
successful companies um there are things
that I don't have to teach them like how
 
that I don't have to teach them like how
do you build a culture? How do you hire
 
do you build a culture? How do you hire
people etc
 
people etc
etc. That being said, the challenge is
 
etc. That being said, the challenge is
if your success was tied in a prior
 
if your success was tied in a prior
generation of SAS where there was a
 
generation of SAS where there was a
playbook to go
 
playbook to go
run, you may rest on your laurels and go
 
run, you may rest on your laurels and go
execute the same playbook you did
 
execute the same playbook you did
before as opposed to attack things from
 
before as opposed to attack things from
a first principles perspective.
 
a first principles perspective.
But if you find me a former founder
 
But if you find me a former founder
who's had a level of success, who has
 
who's had a level of success, who has
groed what this AI moment means and can
 
groed what this AI moment means and can
communicate how they're going to do
 
communicate how they're going to do
stuff differently and how excited they
 
stuff differently and how excited they
are about this ding ding ding ding. The
 
are about this ding ding ding ding. The
challenge is you know when you think
 
challenge is you know when you think
about these deals that are being done
 
about these deals that are being done
preede at whatever
 
preede at whatever
etc those those tend to
 
etc those those tend to
be second or third time
 
be second or third time
founders right and so I think there's a
 
founders right and so I think there's a
challenge on those around getting in a
 
challenge on those around getting in a
price point there's a premium there's a
 
price point there's a premium there's a
premium but you often but you pay what
 
premium but you often but you pay what
you get for but look if somebody's
 
you get for but look if somebody's
obviously if somebody's had prior
 
obviously if somebody's had prior
experience uh and is work and brings a
 
experience uh and is work and brings a
team of people that they know how to
 
team of people that they know how to
work together through thick and thin.
 
work together through thick and thin.
That's very helpful. There's less
 
That's very helpful. There's less
therapy that, you know, a VC needs to
 
therapy that, you know, a VC needs to
provide. That being said, if I think
 
provide. That being said, if I think
about the
 
about the
last two out of my last three
 
last two out of my last three
investments, first- time founders,
 
investments, first- time founders,
first- time software founders, um, but
 
first- time software founders, um, but
live in the issue, uh, know it well,
 
live in the issue, uh, know it well,
have super technical talent, and move at
 
have super technical talent, and move at
a speed that most
 
a speed that most
companies don't know how to move at.
 
companies don't know how to move at.
like the speed and this is what I
 
like the speed and this is what I
published uh earlier this week called
 
published uh earlier this week called
the change
 
economy the speed at which you need to
 
economy the speed at which you need to
execute
 
execute
now people aren't
 
now people aren't
fathoming they're just not fathoming to
 
fathoming they're just not fathoming to
be successful and I think the really I
 
be successful and I think the really I
just had a call with the founder who's a
 
just had a call with the founder who's a
second time founder late 40s early 50s
 
second time founder late 40s early 50s
and he was showing he was like have you
 
and he was showing he was like have you
seen lovable aboutdev I'm like yeah I
 
seen lovable aboutdev I'm like yeah I
know about lovable
 
know about lovable
like why? Well, my 52-year-old sales
 
like why? Well, my 52-year-old sales

interesting this article I published
this week I got the most sort of
 
this week I got the most sort of
response from people like absolutely
 
response from people like absolutely
this is the issue. And what I think what
 
this is the issue. And what I think what
it speaks to is like, oh my god, we have
 
it speaks to is like, oh my god, we have
to fundamentally rethink about how we
 
to fundamentally rethink about how we
run these companies. And what's
 
run these companies. And what's
interesting, back to your question,
 
interesting, back to your question,
Kelly, is a firsttime founder goes,
 
Kelly, is a firsttime founder goes,
well, of course, why would I? This is
 
well, of course, why would I? This is
how what do you mean? Of course, this is
 
how what do you mean? Of course, this is
how you do it. Because they start with,
 
how you do it. Because they start with,
I'm shipping very fast, and then they
 
I'm shipping very fast, and then they
think about all the other processes tied
 
think about all the other processes tied
to that. Whereas if you've been running
 
to that. Whereas if you've been running
a SAS plug for 20 to 30 years and you've
 
a SAS plug for 20 to 30 years and you've
been successful at Salesforce and then
 
been successful at Salesforce and then
this SAS company and this SAS company,
 
this SAS company and this SAS company,
you now go, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my assumptions are
 
you now go, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my assumptions are
all wrong." Yes. And I ask that for that
 
all wrong." Yes. And I ask that for that
reason. Like I'll be honest, even for
 
reason. Like I'll be honest, even for
myself, right? We're old and crotchy
 
myself, right? We're old and crotchy
now. We've been living in this in this
 
now. We've been living in this in this
world for years. Like I I'm even going
 
world for years. Like I I'm even going
through a a transition to think
 
through a a transition to think
differently. And you know, it's kind of
 
differently. And you know, it's kind of
like a fresh tablet is kind of an
 
like a fresh tablet is kind of an
advantage. It's an advantage. Although I
 
advantage. It's an advantage. Although I
think the fun thing is we know the old
 
think the fun thing is we know the old
and we also know all the pain with the
 
and we also know all the pain with the
old. We know the ease it's structured d
 
old. We know the ease it's structured d
but we also understand all the
 
but we also understand all the
pain. So we can understand and go okay
 
pain. So we can understand and go okay
if it's this we can go oh okay we can
 
if it's this we can go oh okay we can
remove all of this pain. But yes like if
 
remove all of this pain. But yes like if
you're you know Kelly like here's the
 
you're you know Kelly like here's the
interesting question. When you're hiring
 
interesting question. When you're hiring
people historically what do we
 
people historically what do we
do? Oh, they've been there, done that.
 
do? Oh, they've been there, done that.
They know the
 
They know the
playbook. Okay, but what if the
 
playbook. Okay, but what if the
playbook's different? And so the
 
playbook's different? And so the
interesting question when we start to
 
interesting question when we start to
look at hiring people for
 
look at hiring people for
roles, experience is definitely
 
roles, experience is definitely
interesting. So they're not completely
 
interesting. So they're not completely
lost, but the ability to be
 
lost, but the ability to be
flexible, understand a clear set of
 
flexible, understand a clear set of
priorities, and quickly iterate and be
 
priorities, and quickly iterate and be
okay with fail like that didn't work.
 
okay with fail like that didn't work.
That didn't work. Because the weird
 
That didn't work. Because the weird
thing, like if you think about product
 
thing, like if you think about product
and dev right now, you could spend nine
 
and dev right now, you could spend nine
months trying to get it right and then
 
months trying to get it right and then
you go build it. Or you could just build
 
you go build it. Or you could just build
five versions and be like, "Okay, here's
 
five versions and be like, "Okay, here's
five. What do you think? Oh, those four
 
five. What do you think? Oh, those four
are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Throw them out. Let's go."
 
are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Throw them out. Let's go."
Like, what is that equivalent for how we
 
Like, what is that equivalent for how we
evaluate talent? You know, it's the
 
evaluate talent? You know, it's the
interesting it's the interesting thing
 
interesting it's the interesting thing
about LLMs or AI, which
 
about LLMs or AI, which
is liberal arts actually kind of really
 
is liberal arts actually kind of really
matters now for kids. It's like the one
 
matters now for kids. It's like the one
skill that's going to remain. Well,
 
skill that's going to remain. Well,
because you if you use deep research,
 
because you if you use deep research,
have you used deep research yet? Either
 
have you used deep research yet? Either
of you? I have. Your ability to because
 
of you? I have. Your ability to because
now you can talk to it in longer form.
 
now you can talk to it in longer form.
So, it's longer prompting. But if you
 
So, it's longer prompting. But if you
learn how to ask what you're asking for,
 
learn how to ask what you're asking for,
which is like the idea of like, I'm
 
which is like the idea of like, I'm
thinking of this problem. I want to
 
thinking of this problem. I want to
frame it appropriately, then it's very
 
frame it appropriately, then it's very
good. Um, and so it's a really
 
good. Um, and so it's a really
interesting thing when you're looking to
 
interesting thing when you're looking to
hire people at all
 
hire people at all
levels. What are the core criteria we're
 
levels. What are the core criteria we're
looking for? Um I don't have the answer
 
looking for? Um I don't have the answer
yet but it's not been there done that.
 
yet but it's not been there done that.
Yeah and on the other side sorry before
 
Yeah and on the other side sorry before
we leave this um you know to I guess
 
we leave this um you know to I guess
give us some credit where we do have the
 
give us some credit where we do have the
advantage is where all the AI articles
 
advantage is where all the AI articles
podcast whatever you want to talk about
 
podcast whatever you want to talk about
it are are saying that will not replace
 
it are are saying that will not replace
is leadership and EQ for right now and
 
is leadership and EQ for right now and
and these things that that I think will
 
and these things that that I think will
become more important. Yeah, because how
 
become more important. Yeah, because how
do you do leadership in a world of so
 
do you do leadership in a world of so
much
 
much
iteration, right? And how do you get
 
iteration, right? And how do you get
people to live in that change and
 
people to live in that change and
iteration and be comfortable with it?
 
iteration and be comfortable with it?
And then how do you manage and drive
 
And then how do you manage and drive
those people effectively? Absolutely.
 
those people effectively? Absolutely.
Like I I would argue that leadership
 
Like I I would argue that leadership
becomes more important. The great thing
 
becomes more important. The great thing
with AI and tools
 
with AI and tools
is it kind of becomes
 
is it kind of becomes
easier. Like I think I I don't know if
 
easier. Like I think I I don't know if
I'm giving you this example, but like
 
I'm giving you this example, but like
when you get to be a leader in a company
 
when you get to be a leader in a company
and you go to you go to your staff
 
and you go to you go to your staff
meeting and you're looking across the
 
meeting and you're looking across the
room and you're trying to figure out why
 
room and you're trying to figure out why
your peers don't why marketing or sales
 
your peers don't why marketing or sales
and success don't seem to get
 
and success don't seem to get
along. Like I can write an agent in five
 
along. Like I can write an agent in five
minutes today that looks across all of
 
minutes today that looks across all of
our support
 
our support
tickets and I can say okay your agent
 
tickets and I can say okay your agent
your job is to go look at customer
 
your job is to go look at customer
success and just tell me like what are
 
success and just tell me like what are
their top issues? Okay. And then I can
 
their top issues? Okay. And then I can
write an agent and say what is product
 
write an agent and say what is product
doing? what are they building and
 
doing? what are they building and
prioritizing? And then I could say, I
 
prioritizing? And then I could say, I
want those two Asians to meet and tell
 
want those two Asians to meet and tell
me what's where they're not getting
 
me what's where they're not getting
along and what like where's the biggest
 
along and what like where's the biggest
disconnect and where are the areas we
 
disconnect and where are the areas we
could drive
 
could drive
alignment. I could build that in like a
 
alignment. I could build that in like a
day and as an executive I could have
 
day and as an executive I could have
sent to me Friday about like what's
 
sent to me Friday about like what's
going on in the or so as opposed to
 
going on in the or so as opposed to
having dress have to dress up like
 
having dress have to dress up like
undercover boss and pretend you're an IC
 
undercover boss and pretend you're an IC
to figure out what's going on. Like it's
 
to figure out what's going on. Like it's
secret shopper. Yeah, secret shopper. So
 
secret shopper. Yeah, secret shopper. So
Brett, I have I have a working
 
Brett, I have I have a working
hypothesis that I want your feedback on
 
hypothesis that I want your feedback on
that I thought like as I was reading the
 
that I thought like as I was reading the
change economy article, I thought you
 
change economy article, I thought you
were going to hit on but you didn't. So
 
were going to hit on but you didn't. So
to to the question of talent, I'm seeing
 
to to the question of talent, I'm seeing
like the biggest thing I'm seeing is
 
like the biggest thing I'm seeing is
teams are getting younger and I feel
 
teams are getting younger and I feel
like we just exited this era to where
 
like we just exited this era to where
like it was nice to have a lot more
 
like it was nice to have a lot more
experience and kind of people who had
 
experience and kind of people who had
been around the block and now there's a
 
been around the block and now there's a
reversion and I think the reversion is
 
reversion and I think the reversion is
because the younger generation is more
 
because the younger generation is more
AI native and they're more comfortable
 
AI native and they're more comfortable
with the speed of iteration which you
 
with the speed of iteration which you
hit on very clearly in your article. The
 
hit on very clearly in your article. The
thing that's coming to me though is
 
thing that's coming to me though is
venture is a huge driver of hiring in
 
venture is a huge driver of hiring in
our
 
our
economy. And so if it's getting younger
 
economy. And so if it's getting younger
and we need fewer people to actually
 
and we need fewer people to actually
build the thing, are we going to see
 
build the thing, are we going to see
like an extinction event for employees
 
like an extinction event for employees
that have been around in venture that
 
that have been around in venture that
like are not like becoming more AI
 
like are not like becoming more AI
native and and getting with this new
 
native and and getting with this new
world? Look, I think to like teams are
 
world? Look, I think to like teams are
younger, which is great, etc., etc.
 
younger, which is great, etc., etc.
There's still an importance of
 
There's still an importance of
direction, intentionality, and picking
 
direction, intentionality, and picking
our true
 
our true
north. Now, we may not have a four
 
north. Now, we may not have a four
release road map, but a one release road
 
release road map, but a one release road
map, but there's still an opportunity
 
map, but there's still an opportunity
for driving alignment. I do believe that
 
for driving alignment. I do believe that
if you are an
 
if you are an
executive at some level and you're not
 
executive at some level and you're not
using the AI tools every day in your own
 
using the AI tools every day in your own
life and the rest of it, I think you
 
life and the rest of it, I think you
become obsolete and I think it's fast.
 
become obsolete and I think it's fast.
Hey, look, it's no different like the
 
Hey, look, it's no different like the
people that like people that use laptops
 
people that like people that use laptops
versus not. I remember bringing in
 
versus not. I remember bringing in
client server computing and if somebody
 
client server computing and if somebody
was like, "No, I want my green screen
 
was like, "No, I want my green screen
deck minivacs. Good luck."
 
deck minivacs. Good luck."
Um I think the more interesting question
 
Um I think the more interesting question
that I look at as it relates to hiring
 
that I look at as it relates to hiring
in HR is that it's less so about look
 
in HR is that it's less so about look
everybody needs to understand how to
 
everybody needs to understand how to
leverage AI to make themselves far more
 
leverage AI to make themselves far more
effective because at the end of the day
 
effective because at the end of the day
people hire employees they spend Y to
 
people hire employees they spend Y to
get X unit of output and it's very clear
 
get X unit of output and it's very clear
for those that are clear leveraging AI
 
for those that are clear leveraging AI
they're they're more productive and so
 
they're they're more productive and so
whether you're an IC or a first level or
 
whether you're an IC or a first level or
second level or a manager or the rest of
 
second level or a manager or the rest of
it if I'm going to compare you at any
 
it if I'm going to compare you at any
level you're going going to be less
 
level you're going going to be less
productive. Sorry, you just are. So,
 
productive. Sorry, you just are. So,
you're going to be less relevant. I
 
you're going to be less relevant. I
think the more interesting question is
 
think the more interesting question is
AI automates a lot of grunt work and a
 
AI automates a lot of grunt work and a
lot of our roles when we hired people
 
lot of our roles when we hired people
into functions at junior levels would do
 
into functions at junior levels would do
the grunt work and in doing the grunt
 
the grunt work and in doing the grunt
work they would kind of learn the
 
work they would kind of learn the
appreciate the craft of the job and then
 
appreciate the craft of the job and then
we would move them up to higher level
 
we would move them up to higher level
work. If we've now removed that grunt
 
work. If we've now removed that grunt
work, then what is that entry level
 
work, then what is that entry level
class of people in? There's an argument
 
class of people in? There's an argument
that says there are less of
 
that says there are less of
them. There's an argument that says the
 
them. There's an argument that says the
younger people that we would hire more a
 
younger people that we would hire more a
native and they actually can come into a
 
native and they actually can come into a
company at a step function higher. I
 
company at a step function higher. I
don't have the answer to it, right? Um
 
don't have the answer to it, right? Um
but I think it's something we're
 
but I think it's something we're
wrestling through, right? Like if you
 
wrestling through, right? Like if you
came into sales engineering or you were
 
came into sales engineering or you were
an SDR, you would come in, you do a
 
an SDR, you would come in, you do a
bunch of research on companies, you'd
 
bunch of research on companies, you'd
pick accounts, you do the rest of it.
 
pick accounts, you do the rest of it.
Like AI is going to do that for you,
 
Like AI is going to do that for you,
right? If you would came in as a junior
 
right? If you would came in as a junior
SE, you came out of whatever services
 
SE, you came out of whatever services
and you would you would put the demos
 
and you would you would put the demos
together in the demo environments, like
 
together in the demo environments, like
you don't have to do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore.
 
you don't have to do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore.
You would answer you would answer all
 
You would answer you would answer all
the RFP templates. You don't have to do
 
the RFP templates. You don't have to do
that anymore. You would know everything
 
that anymore. You would know everything
about the AI, your architecture, and
 
about the AI, your architecture, and
answer security questions. Well,
 
answer security questions. Well,
somebody can just ask a bot that. So
 
somebody can just ask a bot that. So
then the question is, what is that
 
then the question is, what is that
person now doing? That's the bigger
 
person now doing? That's the bigger
question that I wrestle and think
 
question that I wrestle and think
through because we don't want just an
 
through because we don't want just an
organization of topheavy, all super
 
organization of topheavy, all super
expensive, needy people, right? It's
 
expensive, needy people, right? It's
always good to have people. Uh I think
 
always good to have people. Uh I think
that's the interesting thing. I don't
 
that's the interesting thing. I don't
know the answer to, but I I do believe
 
know the answer to, but I I do believe
just like each of you when you use AI
 
individually, you are more productive.
 
individually, you are more productive.
And so then therefore how do we look at
 
And so then therefore how do we look at
that in terms we're bringing people into
 
that in terms we're bringing people into
do roles and the rest of it. Um so
 
do roles and the rest of it. Um so
that's how I don't know long answer to a
 
that's how I don't know long answer to a
short question but it's part for the
 
short question but it's part for the
course. I think I think that will be
 
course. I think I think that will be
interesting Nolan I mean and both of you
 
interesting Nolan I mean and both of you
before I have to draw is the same thing
 
before I have to draw is the same thing
with kids in school because we had to go
 
with kids in school because we had to go
through hell to learn things and
 
through hell to learn things and
practice and write stuff down. They
 
practice and write stuff down. They
don't really have to do that anymore. So
 
don't really have to do that anymore. So
are they
 
are they
actually learning these things and and
 
actually learning these things and and
retaining it versus having a shortcut?
 
retaining it versus having a shortcut?
It's a similar type of thing. And I I
 
It's a similar type of thing. And I I
don't I think that's going to change a
 
don't I think that's going to change a
lot in the way organizations look, how
 
lot in the way organizations look, how
they're run. And I don't think we're
 
they're run. And I don't think we're
really going to see that, I would say,
 
really going to see that, I would say,
until about 15 years from now. It might
 
until about 15 years from now. It might
be sooner. But in terms of education,
 
be sooner. But in terms of education,
look, I think most of the education that
 
look, I think most of the education that
Kelly and I went through, Nolan, you're
 
Kelly and I went through, Nolan, you're
a little younger than us or a lot, was a
 
a little younger than us or a lot, was a
lot of wrote memorization. It was far
 
lot of wrote memorization. It was far
less problem solving. It was a far le I
 
less problem solving. It was a far le I
mean, I didn't do problem solving until
 
mean, I didn't do problem solving until
business school, which was case
 
business school, which was case
management, but even that was silly. I
 
management, but even that was silly. I
was like 27. It was like you're CEO of a
 
was like 27. It was like you're CEO of a
billion dollar company. What would you
 
billion dollar company. What would you
do? And then you left business school
 
do? And then you left business school
thinking you deserve that job and then
 
thinking you deserve that job and then
you were somebody's like assistant
 
you were somebody's like assistant
staple child, right? Wasn't really good
 
staple child, right? Wasn't really good
for, you know, but um you you alluded to
 
for, you know, but um you you alluded to
 
audience up on the drama of that from
 
audience up on the drama of that from
yesterday. So, we've talked about 11X on
 
yesterday. So, we've talked about 11X on
the pod. uh 11X has two products uh of
 
the pod. uh 11X has two products uh of
which they are they're basically
 
which they are they're basically
AISDRs and they had raised uh two
 
AISDRs and they had raised uh two
successive massive rounds of financing
 
successive massive rounds of financing
within months of each other late last
 
within months of each other late last
year and there was this kind of a this
 
year and there was this kind of a this
undercurrent discussion happening
 
undercurrent discussion happening
amongst the gotom market community that
 
amongst the gotom market community that
I'm homies with that was like I don't
 
I'm homies with that was like I don't
know how real this revenue is like I
 
know how real this revenue is like I
haven't seen people like really getting
 
haven't seen people like really getting
value out of this product. And so
 
value out of this product. And so
yesterday, uh, there was an article that
 
yesterday, uh, there was an article that
dropped of which accusing 11X of faking
 
dropped of which accusing 11X of faking
the revenue by, uh, by essentially
 
the revenue by, uh, by essentially
signing customers up for a 12-month
 
signing customers up for a 12-month
contract, but giving them a three-month
 
contract, but giving them a three-month
out in the contract and recognizing that
 
out in the contract and recognizing that
as a, you know, fully as full 12 months
 
as a, you know, fully as full 12 months
of revenue. Um, but many of those
 
of revenue. Um, but many of those
customers are are actually leveraging
 
customers are are actually leveraging
the opt- out clause and dropping out.
 
the opt- out clause and dropping out.
This ties actually to your change
 
This ties actually to your change
economy article to where you talk about
 
economy article to where you talk about
selling the road map. And you know the
 
selling the road map. And you know the
selling the roadmap thing is like I
 
selling the roadmap thing is like I
think we did this at Carta. We would
 
think we did this at Carta. We would
always try and sell like a little bit
 
always try and sell like a little bit
ahead, but if you sold too far ahead,
 
ahead, but if you sold too far ahead,
you would lose trust with the customer
 
you would lose trust with the customer
and the customer would feel like you
 
and the customer would feel like you
sold them a bill of goods, which would
 
sold them a bill of goods, which would
then tarnish your brand, which could
 
then tarnish your brand, which could
potentially be what's happening here.
 
potentially be what's happening here.
So, I guess like the question for you,
 
So, I guess like the question for you,
Brett, is this this is not just about
 
Brett, is this this is not just about
 
that I am being sold as a potential
 
that I am being sold as a potential
buyer of AI. And even you like you're
 
buyer of AI. And even you like you're
you're talking right now about like all
 
you're talking right now about like all
these agents that are doing these these
 
these agents that are doing these these
amazing things. I've experienced some of
 
amazing things. I've experienced some of
it and I am very like techno optimist. I
 
it and I am very like techno optimist. I
still feel like there is so much
 
still feel like there is so much
overpromising. And so how do we think
 
overpromising. And so how do we think
about this when you're evaluating
 
about this when you're evaluating
companies? Like how do you figure out
 
companies? Like how do you figure out
what's actually real?
 
what's actually real?
So look, I'm in the venture community.
 
So look, I'm in the venture community.
I'm a former sales and marketing
 
I'm a former sales and marketing
practitioner. I'm not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on
 
practitioner. I'm not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on
 
is when we're going into AI and
 
is when we're going into AI and
delivering agents, you have to be
 
delivering agents, you have to be
careful trying to ascribe old SAS
 
careful trying to ascribe old SAS
metrics to it, which is they were
 
metrics to it, which is they were
selling a product that promised value
 
selling a product that promised value
that they had a pricing metric based on
 
that they had a pricing metric based on
consumption and at the end of the day
 
consumption and at the end of the day
calling something an annual
 
calling something an annual
contract. When you have an out, that's
 
contract. When you have an out, that's
not ARR. they should have looked at the
 
not ARR. they should have looked at the
business in terms of monthly revenue and
 
business in terms of monthly revenue and
was the monthly revenue looking at the
 
was the monthly revenue looking at the
cohorts to understand if the product was
 
cohorts to understand if the product was
working.
 
working.
Um, you know, if I look at 11X, there
 
Um, you know, if I look at 11X, there
are three things that I think about just
 
are three things that I think about just
and these are attributes to be careful
 
and these are attributes to be careful
about, which is one, what's the promise
 
about, which is one, what's the promise
you're making? And the promise they were
 
you're making? And the promise they were
making was a group that hired a bunch of
 
making was a group that hired a bunch of
STRs that were frustrated that it wasn't
 
STRs that were frustrated that it wasn't
working, but they weren't digging into
 
working, but they weren't digging into
why it wasn't working, which was really
 
why it wasn't working, which was really
that your core underlying messaging is
 
that your core underlying messaging is
irrelevant.
 
irrelevant.
 
haven't been able to send something that
 
haven't been able to send something that
somebody would be interested to engage
 
somebody would be interested to engage
with you and not understanding that when
 
with you and not understanding that when
you're going outbound versus inbound,
 
you're going outbound versus inbound,
they know nothing about you. And the
 
they know nothing about you. And the
idea that somebody would take a phone
 
idea that somebody would take a phone
call or respond to an email, it has to
 
call or respond to an email, it has to
be really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good.
 
be really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good.
And and I think the pro there was this
 
And and I think the pro there was this
proportion of like you've hired all
 
proportion of like you've hired all
these people and you can replace all of
 
these people and you can replace all of
these employees out of the gate with
 
these employees out of the gate with
this cuz it's going to be more
 
this cuz it's going to be more
effective. That's a big
 
effective. That's a big
promise.
 
Um and then
 
Um and then
secondly, you know, does the product
 
secondly, you know, does the product
work or doesn't? So one's what's the
 
work or doesn't? So one's what's the
promise? Two, does the product work or
 
promise? Two, does the product work or
doesn't? I mean the reality in an AI
 
doesn't? I mean the reality in an AI
like the good thing is like it should
 
like the good thing is like it should
just work or not. There should actually
 
just work or not. There should actually
be less hype. You should go understand
 
be less hype. You should go understand
does this work or not. So those are the
 
does this work or not. So those are the
things to wrestle through. The reality
 
things to wrestle through. The reality
with AI though you have to be careful is
 
with AI though you have to be careful is
that if when I look at investing I'm
 
that if when I look at investing I'm
trying to figure out the cool thing at
 
trying to figure out the cool thing at
seed now is normally I would get like a
 
seed now is normally I would get like a
halfbaked product at seed right like
 
halfbaked product at seed right like
here's the product I'm doing this wedge
 
here's the product I'm doing this wedge
solution. here's what it kind of is. And
 
solution. here's what it kind of is. And
when I raise my C, then my A and then my
 
when I raise my C, then my A and then my
B, then I'm gonna have a fullyfledged
 
B, then I'm gonna have a fullyfledged
product because I'm gonna build out
 
product because I'm gonna build out
these screens and then I'll have a great
 
these screens and then I'll have a great
product. And the playbook used to be,
 
product. And the playbook used to be,
oh, I'll have a good success team. So
 
oh, I'll have a good success team. So
like customers will love us until I
 
like customers will love us until I
until they love the
 
until they love the
product. At Seed Now, when I'm investing
 
product. At Seed Now, when I'm investing
in companies, like show me a
 
in companies, like show me a
product. Like look, if I can go
 
product. Like look, if I can go
unlovable and build a pretty good app in
 
unlovable and build a pretty good app in
like I don't know like three days or two
 
like I don't know like three days or two
days like you should have a pretty
 
days like you should have a pretty
kick-ass product and you should be able
 
kick-ass product and you should be able
to give me 10 customers that I could
 
to give me 10 customers that I could
speak to who think this is amazing
 
speak to who think this is amazing
and or not because the other challenge
 
and or not because the other challenge
and Sam Leon or others write on this
 
and Sam Leon or others write on this
called vibe revenue which is there are a
 
called vibe revenue which is there are a
lot of enterprises right
 
lot of enterprises right
now. So that's one. And then the two,
 
now. So that's one. And then the two,
what I have to think through when I look
 
what I have to think through when I look
at it is how easy over time is it for
 
at it is how easy over time is it for
somebody else to just go build what this
 
somebody else to just go build what this
customer is doing, this this investment
 
customer is doing, this this investment
is doing. And so then I start to look at
 
is doing. And so then I start to look at
do they have unique insights around that
 
do they have unique insights around that
person's pain or that that industry
 
person's pain or that that industry
they're targeting? Um is there a
 
they're targeting? Um is there a
metadata mode? like is the idea that if
 
metadata mode? like is the idea that if
I build enough and I'm doing enough jobs
 
I build enough and I'm doing enough jobs
become a compound start uh quicker and
 
become a compound start uh quicker and
then is there something interesting from
 
then is there something interesting from
a data are you gathering data such that
 
a data are you gathering data such that
if you can use off-the-shelf LLMs and
 
if you can use off-the-shelf LLMs and
you train it on that data if you have
 
you train it on that data if you have
more data is the intelligence layer of
 
more data is the intelligence layer of
your product going to be smarter than
 
your product going to be smarter than
somebody coming out of the gate so I
 
somebody coming out of the gate so I
have to look at that because the
 
have to look at that because the
challenge we have right now is
 
challenge we have right now is
that it used to be we were like we only
 
that it used to be we were like we only
invest 500,000 in revenue and people
 
invest 500,000 in revenue and people
like, "Oh, that's a high bar. You know,
 
like, "Oh, that's a high bar. You know,
I don't really know. Like, we got 100k
 
I don't really know. Like, we got 100k
revenue. You should invest now." We're
 
revenue. You should invest now." We're
like, "Look, if you got to get to three
 
like, "Look, if you got to get to three
million in revenue, you're 100K, dude.
 
million in revenue, you're 100K, dude.
You got like six to eight months more of
 
You got like six to eight months more of
figuring stuff out." But now, there are
 
figuring stuff out." But now, there are
companies that can get to like a million
 
companies that can get to like a million
and a half of revenue out of the gate.
 
and a half of revenue out of the gate.
The challenge to figure out is it vibe
 
The challenge to figure out is it vibe
you or not? Because you do have large
 
you or not? Because you do have large
enterprises who are throwing money at AI
 
enterprises who are throwing money at AI
to basically figure out if there's
 
to basically figure out if there's
automation. And the reality is unlike
 
automation. And the reality is unlike
 
it's better, but I don't know how
 
it's better, but I don't know how
valuable it is until I go look at it.
 
valuable it is until I go look at it.
And what I don't know is, oh, but
 
And what I don't know is, oh, but
there's four or five other companies
 
there's four or five other companies
right now that do the same thing, right?
 
right now that do the same thing, right?
And
 
And
so, look, I think on 11X, I think the
 
so, look, I think on 11X, I think the
challenge is they came out with the big
 
challenge is they came out with the big
premise that we are going to steal all
 
premise that we are going to steal all
this money from payroll. Does that sound
 
this money from payroll. Does that sound
exciting? Uh,
 
exciting? Uh,
and I think they misrepresented their
 
and I think they misrepresented their
customer traction from a love
 
customer traction from a love
perspective and I don't think people did
 
perspective and I don't think people did
enough
 
enough
research, right? My comment on Twitter
 
research, right? My comment on Twitter
was like, I don't understand the issue
 
was like, I don't understand the issue
here. Like, did somebody not go talk to
 
here. Like, did somebody not go talk to
 
customers, right? Because I was the
 
customers, right? Because I was the
first person to get my companies to go
 
first person to get my companies to go
try this stuff and and across the board
 
try this stuff and and across the board
they were
 
they were
like, I think it got worse.
 
like, I think it got worse.
because they didn't address the
 
because they didn't address the
fundamental issue was like who are you
 
fundamental issue was like who are you
talking to? What do you know about them?
 
talking to? What do you know about them?
And have you really thought through is
 
And have you really thought through is
your messaging correct around this is
 
your messaging correct around this is
something that they should go look at
 
something that they should go look at
because it's meaningful to them. And 95%
 
because it's meaningful to them. And 95%
of the emails you get from outbound
 
of the emails you get from outbound
engines don't hit that, right? It's a
 
engines don't hit that, right? It's a
delete, delete, delete. And so, and the
 
delete, delete, delete. And so, and the
ones you do, I'm a weird VC. I'll take
 
ones you do, I'm a weird VC. I'll take
cold I'll respond to cold founder email.
 
cold I'll respond to cold founder email.
I'm like look if a founder takes the
 
I'm like look if a founder takes the
time to write something but I get a
 
time to write something but I get a
hundred of them a day and I just go
 
hundred of them a day and I just go
through delete delete delete delete
 
through delete delete delete delete
delete. I don't I mean there's it was
 
delete. I don't I mean there's it was
cold out but I don't feel like I need to
 
cold out but I don't feel like I need to
respond to them but there were three or
 
respond to them but there were three or
four and I'd be like that seems
 
four and I'd be like that seems
thoughtful. They've done some research
 
thoughtful. They've done some research
about me. They know what I care about.
 
about me. They know what I care about.
That seems thoughtful. There's enough
 
That seems thoughtful. There's enough
info. I'll talk to the founder. Sure.
 
info. I'll talk to the founder. Sure.
Like why not? So that's the issue with
 
Like why not? So that's the issue with
 
ironically at AI while it's vibing now
 
ironically at AI while it's vibing now
there's nowhere to hide quickly. The
 
there's nowhere to hide quickly. The
product either works or it does
 
product either works or it does
not. And then the roadmap thing I talked
 
not. And then the roadmap thing I talked
about
 
about
was what is a renewal? It works great.
 
was what is a renewal? It works great.
Wonderful. somebody else comes along and
 
Wonderful. somebody else comes along and
says,
 
says,
"Hey, you can use
 
"Hey, you can use
mine." And in the past, it would be
 
mine." And in the past, it would be
like, "Well, that's a lot of change
 
like, "Well, that's a lot of change
management. I'm going to have to like
 
management. I'm going to have to like
turn this off. It's six months to deploy
 
turn this off. It's six months to deploy
this." Or, god forbid, if you're an
 
this." Or, god forbid, if you're an
enterprise, I got to hire Accenture and
 
enterprise, I got to hire Accenture and
pay a million dollars to design scope.
 
pay a million dollars to design scope.
God, AI is coming from professional
 
God, AI is coming from professional
services. That's a topic for another
 
services. That's a topic for another
day, right? I mean, the weird thing like
 
day, right? I mean, the weird thing like
if you think about it, like what do
 
if you think about it, like what do
professional services people do? I'm
 
professional services people do? I'm
going to charge you a million to deploy
 
going to charge you a million to deploy
Salesforce. Salesforce has a metadata.
 
Salesforce. Salesforce has a metadata.
We know what the objects are. So, we
 
We know what the objects are. So, we
know what they're trying to do. Couldn't
 
know what they're trying to do. Couldn't
we just use an agent to ask the customer
 
we just use an agent to ask the customer
like, "Hey, what do you want to do here?
 
like, "Hey, what do you want to do here?
What do you want to do here? What do you
 
What do you want to do here? What do you
want to do here? Oh, upload your DACA
 
want to do here? Oh, upload your DACA
how it's special." Could an agent just
 
how it's special." Could an agent just
go configure that? Like, do I really
 
go configure that? Like, do I really
need kids rolling off a bus and from
 
need kids rolling off a bus and from
Minnesota? No, I don't. So, that's a
 
Minnesota? No, I don't. So, that's a
whole separate conversation for another
 
whole separate conversation for another
day. But, I think very quickly you're
 
day. But, I think very quickly you're
going to be like, "Does the product work
 
going to be like, "Does the product work
for me?" Yes or no? and oh, is it doing
 
for me?" Yes or no? and oh, is it doing
more for me over time? Because that's
 
more for me over time? Because that's
kind of the really exciting thing I'm
 
kind of the really exciting thing I'm
seeing right now with my founders is
 
seeing right now with my founders is
companies are like, "Wow, this is
 
companies are like, "Wow, this is
awesome. Hey, I'm using this software
 
awesome. Hey, I'm using this software
and this software and this software. Can
 
and this software and this software. Can
you do this as well?" Yeah. The reality
 
you do this as well?" Yeah. The reality
is if I don't need to go build and
 
is if I don't need to go build and
design a bunch of CRUD
 
design a bunch of CRUD
screens, the answer is hell yes. Of
 
screens, the answer is hell yes. Of
course you can. And so the really weird
 
course you can. And so the really weird
challenge I have as an investor is in
 
challenge I have as an investor is in
the past when someone said I'm going to
 
the past when someone said I'm going to
go buy build product B and C and I'm
 
go buy build product B and C and I'm
talking about NR out of the gate. I'm
 
talking about NR out of the gate. I'm
like whoa dude get to product
 
like whoa dude get to product
one. And now I'm
 
one. And now I'm
like they're asking you to do
 
like they're asking you to do
that. Go do it. It's a land grab. Like
 
that. Go do it. It's a land grab. Like
you need to become strategic within that
 
you need to become strategic within that
buyer. like they're going to try to
 
buyer. like they're going to try to
consolidate their purchase of software
 
consolidate their purchase of software
down to the fewest level of helpful
 
down to the fewest level of helpful
software applications AI and that should
 
software applications AI and that should
be you versus someone else. And so
 
be you versus someone else. And so
that's a it's a hard challenge for
 
that's a it's a hard challenge for
founders in terms of
 
founders in terms of
prioritizing you know what is GA of a
 
prioritizing you know what is GA of a
kick-ass product one and what does that
 
kick-ass product one and what does that
look like before I go to product two and
 
look like before I go to product two and
product three. Um, I have not heard that
 
product three. Um, I have not heard that
take and that's a completely different
 
take and that's a completely different
shift than the traditional VC advice.
 
shift than the traditional VC advice.
But, you know, the point I want to
 
But, you know, the point I want to
really hit on right now is what you're
 
really hit on right now is what you're
describing as you assess a a company is
 
describing as you assess a a company is
exactly the things employees should be
 
exactly the things employees should be
assessing. So, right, let's go through
 
assessing. So, right, let's go through
your list. Number one, the first thing
 
your list. Number one, the first thing
is the founder. The second thing is the
 
is the founder. The second thing is the
product. Does it work? You know, by the
 
product. Does it work? You know, by the
way, the founder I've never worked for
 
way, the founder I've never worked for
I've worked for two billionaires.
 
I've worked for two billionaires.
They're crazy. Okay, one was kind of bad
 
They're crazy. Okay, one was kind of bad
crazy, one was good crazy. Okay, no
 
crazy, one was good crazy. Okay, no
names. And they have to be a little
 
names. And they have to be a little
crazy because they're basically saying,
 
crazy because they're basically saying,
"I'm going to create an iconic company
 
"I'm going to create an iconic company
and go through the thicks and thins and
 
and go through the thicks and thins and
I'm going to be able to get more
 
I'm going to be able to get more
customers. I'm going to be able to get
 
customers. I'm going to be able to get
better employees, etc., etc. than
 
better employees, etc., etc. than
anybody else." Um, and so you have to
 
anybody else." Um, and so you have to
really assess that. And my best
 
really assess that. And my best
founders, I'm like, they're crazy. And
 
founders, I'm like, they're crazy. And
then I really have to figure out like,
 
then I really have to figure out like,
are they good crazy or bad crazy?
 
are they good crazy or bad crazy?
because good crazy I can deal with. So
 
because good crazy I can deal with. So
it's kind of maniacal one. So that's the
 
it's kind of maniacal one. So that's the
first thing is is is this founder and
 
first thing is is is this founder and
then second like does the founder have a
 
then second like does the founder have a
unique insight or the people that or the
 
unique insight or the people that or the
team around a problem that they're
 
team around a problem that they're
solving that somebody really cares about
 
solving that somebody really cares about
that really needs to be solved
 
that really needs to be solved
fundamentally better. And so much of the
 
fundamentally better. And so much of the
issue of SAS for the last 20 years,
 
issue of SAS for the last 20 years,

product will work for
 
product will work for
them. I'm just
 
them. I'm just
skipping 60% of the sales process
 
skipping 60% of the sales process
unnecessary, but the product has to work
 
unnecessary, but the product has to work
for them within reason. If you try to
 
for them within reason. If you try to
cast too wide a scope, all you've done
 
cast too wide a scope, all you've done
is taken your engineering team and just
 
is taken your engineering team and just
you they can't go to sleep for, you
 
you they can't go to sleep for, you
know, you don't need that pressure.
 
know, you don't need that pressure.
That's why I don't really love this. But
 
That's why I don't really love this. But
if your product works pretty well, like
 
if your product works pretty well, like
look, try it. And in that world, what
 
look, try it. And in that world, what
we're saying is go use the product
 
we're saying is go use the product
because we know it'll work and we know
 
because we know it'll work and we know
when you use it, you're like, "Holy
 
when you use it, you're like, "Holy
shit." And then you're not going to
 
shit." And then you're not going to
exercise the the app, which is the
 
exercise the the app, which is the
inverse of what happened with 11x. Yeah.
 
inverse of what happened with 11x. Yeah.
And that's the piece for employees that
 
And that's the piece for employees that
I think people really need to underscore
 
I think people really need to underscore
in today's market is the the things we
 
in today's market is the the things we
talked about. But then there needs to be
 
talked about. But then there needs to be
a holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] moment with the product and
 
a holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] moment with the product and
you as an employee need to be like holy
 
you as an employee need to be like holy
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this is like this is going to
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this is like this is going to
be big and you kind of need to care
 
be big and you kind of need to care
about it. Like if you're going into a
 
about it. Like if you're going into a
marketing job and you don't care what
 
marketing job and you don't care what
your company
 
your company
solves, don't take that job. And what I
 
solves, don't take that job. And what I
try to do, and it doesn't happen for
 
try to do, and it doesn't happen for
lower level employees, but any executive
 
lower level employees, but any executive
that's being hired, the CEO gets mad at
 
that's being hired, the CEO gets mad at
me. I'm like, "Have you talked as a VP
 
me. I'm like, "Have you talked as a VP
of sales, VP of what success or VP of
 
of sales, VP of what success or VP of
product or marketing?" I'm like, or
 
product or marketing?" I'm like, or
like, "Have you talked to three of the
 
like, "Have you talked to three of the
customers?" They're like, "No." I'm
 
customers?" They're like, "No." I'm
like, "How are you?" Wait a minute. And
 
like, "How are you?" Wait a minute. And
I look at them, I'm like, "Why would you
 
I look at them, I'm like, "Why would you
take this job?" Now, anomaly, I'm trying
 
take this job?" Now, anomaly, I'm trying
to help recruit this person. Like why
 
to help recruit this person. Like why
would you take a job with a company that
 
would you take a job with a company that
you haven't spoken to two or three
 
you haven't spoken to two or three
customers and understand what they think
 
customers and understand what they think
about the company and listen to them
 
about the company and listen to them
rationally but really listen to how they
 
rationally but really listen to how they
emote about the company because it's the
 
emote about the company because it's the
emotion that you understand and then
 
emotion that you understand and then
understanding how they're delivering
 
understanding how they're delivering
against that emotion that's something
 
against that emotion that's something
you can build a company around and you
 
you can build a company around and you
use the 11x example the issue is they
 
use the 11x example the issue is they
made big promises people didn't really
 
made big promises people didn't really
buy in. So you could you made this big
 
buy in. So you could you made this big
promise you didn't deliver. And the
 
promise you didn't deliver. And the
issue there is you made a big emotional
 
issue there is you made a big emotional
promise. People got super excited and
 
promise. People got super excited and
then you didn't deliver. So that fall
 
then you didn't deliver. So that fall
from grace is much faster. And so I
 
from grace is much faster. And so I
would just make sure you are talking to
 
would just make sure you are talking to
customers. I would go use deep research,
 
customers. I would go use deep research,
right? Go form your opinion. That's how
 
right? Go form your opinion. That's how
I think about it. Sage advice as always,
 
I think about it. Sage advice as always,
