What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have Sarah Tilly on the show. What's up
Sarah? It's nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Hi. It's good to see you. Happy to be
here. Sarah, your background is I would
just say call it dope.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; You've worked at some some super legit
companies. So, you were at Warner
Brothers for a little while, but then
you got into a VP leadership role and
talent at Walt Disney. Some people may
have heard of that.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; On the show. I was at Disneyland last
week.
And now you are at Service Now as the
SVP of global talent management and
acquisition. So I actually don't think
people really understand how mega
service now is as a company. I look
today as of July 11th. It's $194 billion
market cap company. So can you just give
the quick like what is Service Now? How
the hell are you guys such a big
company?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.
So we are the AI platform for business
transformation. that's the buzzwords,
you know, but it actually happens to be
true and I think that's what's
contributed to our success. So, we've
reached the fastest organic growth of
any enterprise software company ever.
And we have a mission here to become the
defining enterprise software company of
the 21st century. What we do basically
is come in and we make work easier for
everyone. So there's a lot of even
before AI became the thing there's just
a lot of things that are difficult
that are clunky that are unenjoyable
and service now as a platform for many
years has come in and connected you know
seamless workflows across multiple
areas. We started in you know it but we
have workflows across all corners of the
organization to take out the grunt work
to provide ease and insights that you
can extract from any point solution from
any system etc. So that's like the
easiest way that I can explain it. And
customers that have even before Disney
was a customer of Service Now still is.
And so I had the opportunity to see the
benefits firsthand. And you know, even
before I joined, it's like customers
love us because we do we're the real
deal. We actually come in and make
things a lot easier and more seamless.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You guys are like the connective
tissue right in the organization is the
way like especially for large
enterprises. So being the you know
talent leader at service now which is
one of the most important AI companies
especially like public companies I'm
assuming that you guys have to be
thinking a lot about AI in the talent
acquisition process.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
&gt;&gt; Walk us through that journey. Like where
are you guys at on that journey and how
are you guys deploying AI today? Yeah,
sure.
Yes, we are an AI company and so the
expectation is that every single person
within Service Now is using AI, is
experimenting with AI, is seeing the
benefits of AI and then of course
there's the whole product development
piece of it as well. So we have an
employee workflow line of business and
so we're thinking a lot about what are
the solutions that we need to create?
How do we, you know, drink our own
champagne, be customer zero on a lot of
these things? So, I'll tell you,
we have been on this journey of how do
we transform
talent, all of our talent efforts with
AI. And I actually think in talent
acquisition,
we have some of the strongest use cases
for AI and across HR, I should say, for
sure. And so I think there's some places
where some of the solutions, some of the
technology that's out there has a little
bit more maturity than even some of the
others. We stepped back and we took a
look at everything because there's so
much so much that you can go after. I
mean, if you just look at the and we've
done it, we've like sort of visually
mapped everything that's out there from
a TA perspective and when you stare at
it, there's like so many options. So I
think what we decided to do was parallel
path like what are the things that we
want to solve for
and then what are the things that we
want to actually lift like you know I
had a friend at Disney who used to say
how do you get things unbad
and I think there's everything from like
what's the stuff we need to get unbad on
to what's the stuff that we want to be
you know world class in so we looked at
that ourselves while at the same timeal
evaluating what are the emerging tools,
what are the emerging solutions that's
coming onto the market and we really
broke it into two speeds. So you know
said differently I think the more common
language is what are the things we need
to better perform on and what are the
things that we need to transform on. So
on the perform and we're deep in this
right now we look we are looking at we
have looked at some of just the standard
fundamental TA technology. So what is
our ATS you know what's of course the
underlying supporting HCM but like what
is our ATS what are CRM capabilities
when it comes to AI so not just the
fundamental capabilities that the ATS
and the CRM have but what is the ease of
use to integrate point solutions within
those what is the ease of redesigning
processes
that relate to some of our basic you the
work that's getting done today. So we
said that's speed one. We got to get the
foundational stuff in place but you know
re-engineering to optimize for AI and
then speed two is what is the stuff that
is going to be more gamechanging and I
do think there's like the lowhanging
fruit. I almost feel like some of the
stuff that were some of the first use
cases for TA and AI are table stakes
now. So if you think about like
optimizing interview scheduling etc. I'm
like yes of course that's low hanging
fruit. You got to do that and you got to
have the right partner and tools etc.
But I also think there's you know to me
the transform stuff is not really about
productivity and efficiencies. I think
it's about insights. So on the speed one
we said okay let's just do some basic
solutioning around things like how do we
more effectively more quickly leverage
AI to craft tailored interview questions
and evaluate their effectiveness let's
use AI in order ranking you know
applicants and also supporting candidate
rediscovery you know so like AI powered
tools to help talent teams like
reconnect with strong pass applicants
and then all of the relationship
management stuff that you can optimize
with AI now through ATS and other
solutions and then bias reduction. So
implementing AI tools to draft more
inclusive job descriptions and
continuously like audit algorithms for
unintended biases. So I think that
there's like and then we also just in
how we measure the success of the
function we said okay let's use the
tools to embed data into every dimension
of what we can measure today. So that's
like the performance of our recruiters
and sourcers and everyone measures that
slightly different but there's some
common metrics right like how quickly
are they filling job what's the volume
of those where you can get some info on
quality of hire but also capacity and
just all the things that we said we can
use data more effectively now to drive
operational excellence put those things
into dashboards
so all of that still I think is like on
the fundamental foundational stuff on
perform And then the stuff that I get
most excited about on the transform is
again what are the insights that you can
pull. So now you've got tools like find
them etc that can go out and map the
universe of talent with trillions and
trillions of points of data that we
weren't able to use before. There's
market intel tools that I was talking to
someone the other day that said talent
moves precede business moves. I just
thought that was brilliant, too, because
it's like, okay, we can now see in this
part of the world, these companies are
starting to hire and build up teams that
have these specific capabilities. What
is that indicating to us? So, it's like
pulsing the market,
identifying talent, using the insights,
some of the tools that we're exploring.
You can put everything into a container
in the interview process like from the
minute you uncover someone to every step
in the process. You can do some
regression analysis but you can also do
correlation analysis. Say literally what
question ultimately leads to the highest
degree of success for this type of role
in you know in this part of the world
today? What do we think it will be
tomorrow? what are the questions that
were asked that correlate to success,
you know, in roles and who are the
interviewers, how many, what are their
backgrounds, you know, you can literally
get to correlating every single thing.
And to me, that's where it's most
exciting are the insights and the data
that we're going to be able to use to
inform talent acquisition and hiring in
a way we've never been able to.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Dose, who leads talent at Signal Fire,
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metiv is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metaview changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metivview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora, and check out
Metav. Head over to metave.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
Sarah, you all are obviously just on it,
you know what I mean? Proactive,
aggressive, focused, all these things. I
don't know about you, Nolan, or both of
you. I get a lot of questions from not
just people leaders, but you know, port
code companies and CEOs, like how do you
break it down for us, advice for the
audience? How do you get started on
that? You know what I mean? because
we're a lot of companies are talking
about it, but can you break down like
how you just bit the bullet and started
to cross that bridge? Did you change up
goals? Did you hire someone to do it?
Did you assign someone's full-time job?
Did you change up your operating
mechanisms? Like, what was the fire
under your asses to do that? And how did
you get to where you are? Because all of
that stuff you listed that had to have
taken a lot of time, work, effort, etc.
How did you organize it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great question.
We actually start we've been moving at a
very fast pace and we started last year
by doing some benchmarking and we
leverage hacket you know great partners
over there to just say hey if we were to
do nothing how are we doing comparative
to our peers and that was insightful to
see where were we were really leading
the way and where we had some
opportunity and that benchmarking
exercise was everything from again the
how we measure ourselves which is where
I think a lot of TA leaders start. It's
like we kind of naval gaze. We say,
"Well, these are the things, right, that
are most important." But what we found
was really valuable was talking more to
the business and saying, "What is most
important to you? What would you like to
see more of faster?" And at the end of
the day, there weren't a lot of
surprises in terms of the business is
going to optimize on speed and quality,
period.
Some parts of the business care more
about optimizing on cost than others.
like finance, but for the most part,
speed and quality and then saying, okay,
then what are the things that we need to
change in order to be able to do both of
those things? And so then we brought in
some Yeah, we brought in our partners at
BCG. They've been phenomenal, too, to
help us say, all right, just, you know,
it wasn't a long extensive exercise. We
said we have all of this information
right from hiring leaders, from
candidates, from our own teams. We did a
ton of interviews like help us sort
through this and figure out what do we
prioritize, but also again and I know
this word gets thrown around a lot, but
like a product mindset design thinking
approach where it's like you you think
about any of these consumer apps,
they're starting with what does the
consumer want? what do they care about
on their Uber app or fill in the blank,
you know, and working backwards from
there. So, I would say practically that
was really, really helpful for us. We
were able to do it faster with some
external partnership support. We could
have done it internally, but then to
your question too, we did say, "Okay,
we're going to have to dedicate some
focus on this. So let's take people from
other parts of the TA organization and
even the broader talent organization and
let's shift their focus to this. So we
really did say okay we need and I
believe strongly in this that you have
to kind of separate out the people that
are just naturally good innovative
thinkers that kind of think about what's
possible. let them do that and separate
that out from those that are just really
good at problem solving for today. So,
we did say, okay, we got some folks that
are just really good at thinking about
the art of possible. Let them do that
and not get bogged down and have a
percentage of their time and acknowledge
and, you know, reward their performance
for that. And that's just a small I
don't think you need like just a small
percentage of time dedicated to that
because there's only so much you can do
in that blue sky thinking. But then
let's get really smart capable people
that are doing a lot of important work
but now we need them to shift on this.
So I think we were able to go faster. I
think we would have gotten there anyway
even if we hadn't you know leveraged
some external partnerships. But the
thinking I think the important advice
was you know to your question one start
with what matters most to the business
ask them be very overt in asking them
and
then dedicate some resources within that
once you ask the business you can
prioritize
and then you can figure out like yes
where do we need to carve out some
dedicated focus on those two speeds I
talked about but really have them
separate. Have the thinking on the
transform be separate and then you start
to prioritize. Okay, now what are we
going to do from a technology
perspective, from a process perspective?
All of those things.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you say hackit? What what is
hackit?
&gt;&gt; Not sure how I would describe them, but
they're basically like a a benchmarking.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And so they basically come in and
they say here's what everyone else is
either doing or using. Do I have that
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So what they have is deep access
to data like there's the stuff that you
can go out in the world and find.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But for the clients that they have
done a deeper benchmarking exercise with
then they can compare you know like what
is the workload that you know your peer
group and they carve out a peer group
like what is the you know again some of
the standard metrics which are easy to
point to what's the time to fill what's
the workload what's the you know
&gt;&gt; yeah I just want to highlight the
takeaway because I you know in addition
to feeling it myself but talking to a
lot of other leaders who are feeling the
daunt like it's daunting like how to get
started etc. But just having some
external help to break it down for you
and kind of demystify and digest this
stuff can be half the battle to get
started you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So Sarah what did you learn from
that given that you guys are you know
one of the biggest companies in the
world. You have the resources to pull
that lever and to bring help in. And so
what did they tell you? Did they tell
you, "Hey, you guys are super far
behind." Or did they say, which is kind
of what me and Kelly keep hearing all
the time, which is like, "Oh, nobody's
really done yet, and there's like a
lot of opportunity here."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What they told us is that there
were places where we were moving ahead
and there were places where we were
falling behind, which wasn't a surprise
because that's I think the nature of a
fast growing tech company. There's
places where it's like we are race car,
you know, effort. So for example,
our volume has grown year over year in
terms of hiring. So like you know even I
would say like probably seven eight
years ago prior to me joining Service
Now they had a complete self-service
model and that might even be like eight
or nine years and anyway it was in the
recent past. It was less than a decade
ago. When I say they had a self-service
model, that means that leaders were
doing all of their own recruiting,
period. They didn't even have a TA
function.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I love that.
&gt;&gt; And so they started to build it. Yeah. I
I loved it, too. Except when it becomes
a part of a million other things you
have to do in your day job, then what
you're going to get is basically
the best that you can spend some time
on, the best that you get from an
applicant standpoint. And what we are
most interested in is competing for the
best talent in the marketplace period
wherever they sit. And so I think you do
have to have a real strategy and a real
kind of hunger and a competitive mindset
for that and the capabilities to do it.
So we went from that to naturally year
overyear the volume of hiring was
increasing because of the success of the
organization. And word was starting to
get out about what service now could do.
So we started growing like crazy. And
then you know a true TA team function
was built. Eventually I was brought in
and you know you looked around and you
saw that when volume was increasing we
were putting people against that which
was understandable like as quickly. Okay
we got to hire another 600 people in the
next quarter. Okay let's hire more
recruiters and sources to support that.
Naturally, that's what you would do. But
then what happens is eventually you
cannot sustain that. You can't continue
to match the volume increase with the
number of people that you're going to
put against that. So that's where we had
to start taking a look at where do you
optimize it? Where do you use more
technology? Where you get more
efficient. So there were some places
where we were a little bit behind on
that and then other places to your point
where we were using technology and some
of our own technology in terms of
workflows
and dashboards and access to information
and quite frankly the level of insights
that we were bringing to the business on
like okay this is where we're getting
talent from. This is where we're losing
talent too. This is what we know about
that. and being able to feed those
insights, things that I think a lot of
TA organizations are going to be doing
more of with AI, but it was, you know,
clear that we were leading the way on
some of that. So, we learned that, yeah,
we have the two speeds really.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, Kelly, I want to underscore
what Sarah just said, which is what
you've been saying, and I've been using
this in a lot of conversations with
early stage founders, right? Which is
there's this sound bite right now, which
is, oh, like get rid of HR, get rid of
talentines, but like it ultimately ends
up falling on that functional exec,
right? Like Kelly's line is the work
doesn't go away. And so Sarah, it sounds
like what you guys actually realized
running that experiment and playing it
all the way through is like the work
doesn't go away. And in fact, like those
execs have a day job, which is like
building the product or serving
customers or whatever the hell it is.
And that's where these, you know, these
TA functions, these HR functions come in
to be super helpful, is like, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Like it's cute to say
reinvent HR and get rid of HR, but like
there's still that work. Somebody's got
to do the work, right?
&gt;&gt; 100%. And quite frankly, if I were to
start my own business tomorrow, which I
don't have the brains or the energy for,
but if I ever, you know, if let's say I
I did, you know, get into founder mode
by some miracle, I think there's like a
couple of places that I would start with
from an HR perspective. I'd make sure I
had a way to get people paid. I'd make
sure that legally we could stayed out of
trouble and I would make sure that I had
a TA team that could go out and compete
for talent. Like honestly, I think like
those are some of the most important
things. And then as you grow and you
mature and you scale, all those other
things become critically important. So
like for example, learning and
development, that's one that I think
gets under prioritized. And this is
coming to life at this moment more than
ever when we're in this like what some
are calling low higher low fire you know
sort of mode in the market. It's because
organizations
are
realizing, okay, we can't do what we've
done in the past sometimes, which is
like, oh, now there's this new
technology. So, we're going to like take
all of these people that have been
working on this technology that we're
sunsetting that's going to become
outdated, and we're going to impact
them, and then we're going to go out and
hire people that have these new
capabilities. With AI, it permeates
every single role across the company.
And I know you all have talked about
some of that. So it's like you you
actually are going to have to figure out
how to skill up every single person to
different levels of proficiency. But if
you don't have the engine and the
culture for that, it's going to be hard
for those companies I think that are
trying to do the same thing that they've
done in the past, you know, which is
swap out.
&gt;&gt; We talked to Brandon Salmon about that
who's the chief people officer at
Zapier. And you know what Brandon was
saying was basically it sounds like AI
has been adopted by like 90% of Zapier
employees right so people are using it
but you know you said something earlier
about these experimenters and I like
that framework of like you know there's
people who are just kind of like you
know are just naturally more inclined to
go experiment on these frontier
technologies and then they're bringing
it back to everyone else who's like
doing the day job who just like doesn't
want to like go and tinker with
&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt; that kind of feels like the modern
version of L &amp; D to me, right? Like
before L &amp; D was like you sit in a
classroom and you get like this program
and you're like your eyes are bleeding
and nobody gives a about what's
going on. But now it's like the feedback
we got from that Brandon episode was
like Nolan Kelly like that was so dope
because he showed his screen and was
showing real life examples of like how
this can impact my day in and day out.
And I'm assuming that's what your
experimenters are doing too, right
Sarah? like it. They're coming back and
they're saying, "Hey, here's what we
learned and how you should be deploying
it." And then, "Oh, by the way, like,
you know, play it six months forward. If
you're not deploying it, then you
probably will get fired because like you
have to be leveraging this technology."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that kind of goes back to
Kelly's question too, just in terms of
practical advice. this moment with AI
which is not really a moment anymore but
it's like you know this way of working
that has been another I would say very
telling
an important part of our like
transformation which is really
understanding who's capable of evolving
right to your point like there's the
innovators there's the people that like
to experiment and that's where you put
them into pilots right and you let them
run and you let them like you know
experiment but then in a situation like
what we're facing with AI where everyone
has to have some foundational
capabilities and they have to have some
you know what's like propensity to to
get in and learn a new thing. We
actually even do things like pulse
our teams to see who's using the AI
capabilities that exist within co-pilot
that exist within LinkedIn that exists
within some of our internal and external
tools like we get updates from our
insights team to say who's doing that.
Now, it's not a punitive approach, but
it certainly is, okay, where are we
going to have to lean in? And of course,
there's all the communication that
happens with myself, with my leaders to
help them understand that this is going
to be like, you know, our survival
depends on how well we do with adoption
of AI and finding the the perfect sort
of intersection between what humans do
well and what AI does really well better
than humans. So all the communication
about the importance getting people
inspired on that you know that's just
fundamental like that's you know change
management leadership 101 but then we're
also pulsing to say who's actually
adopting it right who's resisting it or
who just needs more help you know and
and starting to weave that into our
approach. Are you asking people Sarah to
tell you if they're using it? Oh, we can
see we can see
&gt;&gt; your seat. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see on the back end like
for example the usage of something like
a co-pilot, you know, tool.
&gt;&gt; Oh, customers, not employees or both?
&gt;&gt; No, no, employees.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Employees, right? And has that had
any ripple? Big brother effect, a little
paranoia, a little fear or not as much?
&gt;&gt; I don't we haven't seen any of that. I
We've actually seen more excitement
about it.
But I think that also has a lot to do
with how we've been communicating this
and how we've leaned in, you know, at
every level to say like you're a part of
this team and we are investing in you.
And we're very fortunate because that
comes from the top, our CEO who like
just regularly reiterates that it
doesn't matter how great our products
are. It doesn't matter how great our go
to market strategy is that without the
right team, the right people and he
literally means it like we're all part
of like think about it like on a sports
team like we're all part of it and you
better like leaders you better ensure
that your team feels your support. They
understand we're loyal to them and the
business strategy means nothing without
the people strategy and vice versa. So
it's embedded in our culture fortunately
and so I think that has made it easier
for employees to say okay this can feel
like a scary moment especially within a
function like TA where there's so much
opportunity but I trust that this
company my leaders are going to help me
get there and it's up to me to like
really you know commit to evolving but
the support's there. Yeah. And I wanted
to ask you so earlier asked about kind
of how you catalyze crossing the bridge
and doing all you know the work you're
doing on AI and I'm assuming the company
and the you know the inertia of the
leaders and the CEO has something to do
with that as well. And I've been talking
to a lot of enterprise companies who,
you know, kind of this phrase now I hear
is, well, we're too enterprisey and all
these, right, old school enterprise SAS
companies are trying to pivot very
quickly or else they're going to be kind
of obsolete. Did you all have that as a
company? Was that a mantra or a kind of
call to action? I'm assuming it was
given what you just said, but I just
wonder how that looked. Well, I think
what we realized was actually there was
a big opportunity for us because of our
platform. It's like, oh gosh, you know,
all these point solutions that again our
CEO likes to say, nobody has to lose in
order for Service Now to win because we
aren't a single point solution. We
integrate with everything, right? we
like our the connected tissue I think is
what Nelin you may have said but it's
because of that we saw okay this is
actually going to work in our favor and
that is not going to be the case for
every enterprise SAS company in fact
yeah there there should be some fear
there but for us the call to action was
more then let's make sure that we are
activating on every single AI
opportunity within our platform
solutions and so it was slightly
different, you know, and we do partner
with all the hyperscalers and I think
that matters, you know, in terms of our
our future.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you guys have how many
employees, Sarah?
&gt;&gt; We have about 27,000 globally across 37
countries.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you know, the thing that I've
been thinking about for 15 years in
talent is quality of hire.
&gt;&gt; And you guys are in a really unique
position given that you have almost
 
you have a massive market cap, thus you
have like resources to go think about
this problem, but the scale is so big
that your CEO can't approve every offer,
I assume, which is kind of like what,
you know, kind of these upand cominging
companies are doing to try and have some
sort of a backs stop to ensure the
quality bar stays high. How do you guys
think about quality of hire? How do you
think about making sure that the bar is
raised or set if not raised with every
hire? And then what are you doing on the
back end to inform the recruiting team
to figure out like are we actually doing
things that are making the quality of
talent at Service Now getting better?
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going to break down that
question and I love it. So first and
foremost, I think that there's where we
are today and the way that we've
measured quality of hire is the standard
sort of markers of it which is you know
how well did they perform? So what is
their formal performance rating? Did
they move? Did they promote? Are they
still here? Retention. So the kind of
standard markers. But what I think is
most exciting is like where this is
going. So of those standard markers,
yes, we do look at that by recruiter,
but we also look at hiring leader,
hiring department to say, you know, h
how are we performing overall and dig
into some of that. And I do think that
some of the tools that I mentioned
earlier in terms of being able to use AI
tools to have more consistent,
standardized, structured framework and
how you're assessing talent has already
given us a lift to your point on quality
of hire. So there's not so much like
there's not so much left to chance and
there's not so much left to gut
instinct, you know, in terms of how
leaders are defining. are saying no this
is the formula these are the questions
these are the things that we've
identified are most important to this
role based on what we know today and
then we do also this is that human
component of recruiting that I think
will never go away is
the relationship the connection and we
say we never compromise on hiring for
character no matter how great you know
your track record is how impressive your
resume is. So, there's some things
within that we like look for and we kind
of standardly probe on in terms of how
they show up as leaders and how much
success they've had in, you know,
cultivating talent, etc. But I would
also say where we're going on quality of
hire is again some of those things that
I'm most excited about that AI will be
able to ultimately help us do. And I
don't think you can have this
conversation without bringing in skills,
which some people are just fatigued on
the topic overall. But if you think
about it, like for years and years and
years, there's been this conversation
about skills first hiring, skills first
managing, skills first assessments on
promotions, etc. Meaning, let's not like
look at who they know or what degree
they have, but let's be able to more
precisely assess the specific skills
that we'll continue to test are most
important for that role and then do that
at scale. So, let's say in my job, I
don't know if my job's a great example,
maybe we'll use it. So like here are the
fundamental skills that I need to have
you know so it's not just about like
that I've worked at these companies or
I've led team sizes of this but it's
like okay Sarah in your role you have to
have strong decision- making
capabilities I'll use soft skills you
know you have to be able to influence
through written and verbal communication
I'll just make those up you know those
are like specific skills that we can Now
eventually like through a skills
intelligence strategy and using AI be
able to like parse those out for every
single job at scale to then say okay
what are the tools we're going to assess
those for the technical skills using
something like a hacker rank or whatever
it may be to say we're going to test the
proficiency level of these specific
skills and then ultimately
you're going to be able to say quality
of hire is not just about what their
performance rating got was or how fast
they moved within the company, but
you're going to be able to say, did they
bring the skills? Did they develop the
skills that we know fundamentally leads
to success in this role? And so, I think
there's going to be just a far more
sophisticated way where we can measure
the quality of hire as we start to
sprinkle in more of skills. There's so
much more. Like I could go I start to
get nerded out on this stuff because I
think there's just like so much
potential, but I think that it is really
about some demonstrated behaviors and
performance that you're going to be able
to get to a level of specificity.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're actually going to be able
to tie it back, right? Like that's the
thing is like I think with AI we're
going to get to this point to where
we're able to tie back outcomes
to like to like what what did we you
know what did we do in the interview
process that got this person that's
either incredible or not.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; That's what I'm most excited about. So
Sarah, where can people find you?
&gt;&gt; Well, I live in Los Angeles. Is that
what you mean?
&gt;&gt; So which coffee shop do you frequent?
you know, we're a Starbucks family, so
you know, but I love the little like
local, you know, support local
businesses in Los Angeles, everyone.
But yes, I live in LA and I'm of course
on LinkedIn and I'm always open to
making new connections, meeting new
people.
&gt;&gt; Are you from LA, Sarah, given your
Disney and
&gt;&gt; No, I'm actually from Arkansas. So, I
was born in Georgia, grew up in
Arkansas, go Razerbacks, and then moved
to Los Angeles with a friend that, you
know, decided she was going to be a big
movie star and and was like, "Hey, come
after undergrad and just spend a little
time in LA and then you can go back to
the South and go to grad school or do
whatever." And then I never left. I love
LA.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Awesome, Sarah. Great. Thank you so much
for spending the time. I appreciate you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. Truly
