# Molly Graham on Founder Depression and Executive Team Dynamics

## Transcript

 
For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, we talked to Silicon Valley
operator Molly Graham on founder
depression, imposttor syndrome,
executive team dynamics, and building
business first people operations at
scaling companies. Hey everyone, welcome
back to the HR Heretics podcast. Today
we're excited to bring you a
conversation with Molly Graham. Molly
Graham is a Silicon Valley legend. She
was at Google and then early Facebook
and then the ninth employee at Quip
before they sold for $750 million. Molly
blew our minds and I can't wait for you
guys to listen to it. Molly Graham,
welcome to HR Heretics. How are you?
&gt;&gt; I'm good, thanks. Nice to see you guys.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for being on. So, you have maybe
two of the most like viral first round
articles of all time. giving away your
Legos and why you need to make friends
with the monster chewing at your leg.
Can you give some insights into our
audience as to like what drove these
articles and what made you write them?
&gt;&gt; I appreciate you mentioning the monster
article because most people only talk
about the Legos article and they're
they're both like near and dear to my
heart. The Legos article was an accident
because it's a metaphor I came up with
when I was working at Google. Google was
 
department was 25 people when I joined.
I joined in communications and it grew
from 25 people to 125 people in 9
months. And I just noticed a pattern
when people had to give things away uh
where it created a lot of insecurity.
You know, somebody new joins, you're
worried they're going to be better than
you. I sort of vividly remember early on
I was in the communications department
at Facebook for like two months and I I
had to take over the blog from someone
else. We didn't even have a Facebook
page at that time and the woman I was
taking it over from was having a lot of
trouble giving it away because she had
um she had built it from nothing. And I
actually talked to her about the Legos
metaphor at the time where I was just
like look this is this is hard. this is
what this feels like, but there's can be
a lot of opportunity on the other side
if you if you let go of things. Um, and
and it helped. I also think what it is
is that people don't talk about emotions
at work all that much. Like they don't
talk we talk a lot about how to scale.
We talk a lot about um how to manage. We
talk a lot about how to lead, but we
don't talk about how hard it is and how
emotional it is and how scary it is and
the fact that, you know, every day you
wake up and you're like, you know,
everyone around me is better than me and
who even gave me this job in the first
place? And I really I always say like I
think the Legos article just says like
don't worry it's all going to be okay
and that's why people like it so much.
And then the monster article is the same
thing maybe just a little deeper. I was
raised on the Muppets so I think that's
why he's a monster. Um I always think
he's like animal or something like that
you know but um you know it became my
metaphor for all these emotions that you
have uh when you're going through these
complex experiences building a company.
Um, and it helped me to externalize it.
Um, and that's how I came up with Bob,
my monster. He's just the external
manifestation of all the emotions I that
I call them monster attacks. So, like
you're having a bad day and somebody's
being a jerk and you want to write the
rage email. Like I always say, that's
Bob. That's my monster's name is Bob. I
tell people they can name their monster
whatever they want. It helped me to
externalize it. It helped me to like
sort of manifest it in a picture. And
then once that article came out,
somebody actually told me it's a literal
tool that psychologists use to help
people manage anxiety. And I was like,
"Oh, great."
&gt;&gt; Turns out it's actually helpful. So
yeah,
&gt;&gt; you were at like the the beginning of
the coining the imposttor syndrome,
right? Like wave. I I do have a question
about that cuz that was a while back and
I feel like I feel like it's common now,
right? People lean into talking about
imposttor syndrome and Legos. Do you
think the industry has shifted a lot
with that? Cuz back when you published
those, it was kind of taboo or more
taboo, I would argue, than now.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think probably it has shifted. I
think for any number of reasons, we've
gotten better at talking about work and
um and feelings, but nobody really talks
about founder depression. Uh nobody
really talks about that experience of
founding a company and how emotionally
hard it is. And we there was a couple
founder suicides around the time that I
was thinking about the monster article
and um you know I felt like we were not
talking enough about the tornado of
feelings that happen as you're building
something and particularly if you're
really early. I think that has gotten
better but I would guess I would say
it's probably a topic you can't talk
about enough because to catch somebody
before they do something dramatic like
everybody needs to be talking about it.
People need to normalize it and help
people understand that just because they
feel like everything's terrible and
they're about to drive the car off a
cliff like actually that's that's
normal. That's what founding a company
feels like. But um yeah
&gt;&gt; and also being an early employee at a
company because I mean
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; So you you were at Google in the tens of
thousand 15,000 Facebook around 500 quip
at nine pre-product. walk us through the
differences of going from a scaled
company and then Facebook is still it
was postp productduct market fit the
company scaling really fast to then
pre-product we haven't launched you're
the ninth employee I I would say they
were all very different and I was
unprepared for any of them Google I
stumbled into which sounds crazy but um
and you know at a company that big you
you identify more with the experience of
your team than you do with the
experience of the company so for me my
experience at Google was defined by that
scaling
of the team um which was you know 25 to
 
stumbled in there 500 employees uh 80
million users when I joined and I left
at 5,500 employees and a billion plus
users and yeah when I left Facebook I
was unprepared for what 500 employees
felt like just to be clear but it was
literally a different company every 1 to
 
companies are not that way it was just
such rapid scale I literally like
thought that I had a picture in my head
when I left Facebook and I you know took
some time off and did a job search that
was very short ended up going to quip. I
thought startups were just a lot of hard
work and I think I was absolutely
floored in the first six months by the
emptiness of startups and the sort of
feeling of loneliness and the feeling of
like
everything we do might not work. I got
run over by a truck. Like we launched
and I knew exactly what launches felt
like. And then we got to the other side
of the launch and it was just like
nobody cared, you know? And when I was
hiring employees into Quip, I tested
them on this because we hired a couple
people from Facebook and Google and I
was like, are you cool working for some
place that nobody cares about? You know,
are you cool selling a brand that no
one's ever heard of and people aren't
going to want to take your call? And so
with Quip, like I I was in a dark phase
about the 3 months after the launch and
I really had just this feeling of like
this car driving off a cliff or
something and I and because I me I like
thought it was all my fault or something
and I went out to uh lunch with a friend
of mine who later ended up working at
Quip and uh he had worked in the 0ero
to1 space before which I never had and
and I was explaining to him how I was
feeling which was really hard because I
just thought it was like an expression
of us like failing or something like
that. And he was like, "Yeah, welcome to
startups." I was like, "Oh, this is
normal." And it literally took the
weight off my shoulders just because
somebody told me, "Yeah, that's how
everybody feels." Um, and I feel like
that's the power is when somebody says,
"Yeah, you're spo you're supposed to
feel this way." And you're like, "Oh,
okay." I always say, uh, life is a
barter economy. And that is actually how
you build a really strong network. You
do things for people and then in two
years or whatever they owe you a favor.
What you want with a powerful network is
a lot of people that would do anything
for you. And that means to to earn that
you have to do a lot of things for other
people. And I have a very broad network
of people in the world that would do
anything for me because I've done a lot
of stuff for them. And and I don't think
of it as like they owe me. I just think
of it as like we do stuff for each
other. And that that is how you build a
network. With jobs, it's the same thing.
Like you want people to want to work
with you again. So like first of all,
don't be a dick when you're at your
company. Second of all, like stay in
touch with people. Like every time I
leave a company, I make a list of people
that I loved working with and I just
stay in touch with them. I definitely
have a really high risk tolerance. I
don't really think of it that way
because I think of it as getting bored
easily. I enjoy learning curves that are
so steep that I'm scared I'm going to
fall off them. I have this concept of
legs of a stool um for work happiness.
For me, my legs are a mission that
matters to me that I want to work on. Uh
people that I love and and want to see
every day and want to learn from. And
when I say learning, what I mean is a
curve so steep you're going to fall off.
I was sitting at CZI, which is like what
 
like, who the actual [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hired me to do
this job? like this is a $70 billion
philanthropy and
&gt;&gt; I can't do math. Maybe I like is
everybody cool with that, you know? And
like I was sitting at this table with
like biomedical scientists that's won
every award except for a Nobel Prize,
you know, David Pluff who ran Obama's
campaign, Jim Shelton who was in the
Obama White House and has run, you know,
a bunch of really impressive
organizations. And, you know, I'm the
idiot that's sitting there pausing the
conversation while they're all talking
being like, "Sorry, can I just ask a
question? Like, do we have goals?" I
talk a lot about being a professional
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and that's really what I am like
these days. I I actually say half of
it's luck and half of it's saying yes
when people ask you to do crazy things.
&gt;&gt; Risk partially comes from being secure.
I've had financial security and I've had
people supporting me like even Cheryl
saying like I think that project will be
dead in two months but you'll still have
a job. Like that's a kind of security.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. Metav is the
AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level

compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metav changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and

&gt;&gt; I think a lot of people are going to
learn from you and learn from this
episode. On that note, you've worked
with amazing teams. I'm curious about
like what it's like when teams are
working and also when teams aren't
working and how you dissect that and how
you go about getting teams to work well
together. I will just say that like
there's a saying in the in the tech
industry, growth solves all problems. I
actually very strongly believe that's
true. Meaning you can have highly
dysfunctional companies that have a
magical product market fit and that
dysfunction will get them actually
pretty far. It never ceases to amaze me
the level of dysfunction underneath some
of the, you know, 10 and 50 billion
more, I would say 10 billion dollar
companies. It hits you at some point,
the dysfunction, but the first thing
that matters is your business. And if
your business is sucking, the
dysfunction shows up more clearly. I've
built a couple really happy,
high-erforming teams in dysfunctional
businesses. And I think that's hard to
do. It's actually one of the hardest
tasks because when all your goals are
red or when you know the number isn't
what your investors want it to be like
to have a team that's happy and loves
working together is it's an extra
effort. You know one thing we don't talk
enough about is uh the fact that if your
leaders don't like each other and don't
get along
everything's going to be shitty inside
your company. Like if your engineering
leader and your product leader don't
enjoy working together, it is going to
be very very hard to effectively ship
code um because those two people have a
bunch of friction and tension um and
it's going to show up in meetings, it's
going to show up in process and it
reverberates down into their team.
Suddenly the product managers don't like
the engineers or whatever. Um same on
the marketing and sales side. I've been
talking to more more and more founders
about uh recently as they hire their
first executive teams or their second
executive teams is not just hiring
individuals but hiring a team and really
thinking through that team formation
both like uh what roles you actually
need and then also the kind of person I
always say is there's the what and then
there's the how right so there's like
what are you hiring for what kind of
experience what kind of background what
kind of skills s what kind of seniority
and then there's the how. How how do you
want them to do their work. A lot of
times we don't focus on that how and it
leads to leadership teams that hate each
other and then it's just like a mess
underneath them and then you're not
hitting your goals because your sales
leader and your marketing leader hate
each other. How do you think about
assessing for that as part of I think
executive recruiting is a mess and so
how do you assess for those skills
specifically the relational skills
between cross functional execs?
 
I actually think I'm a really good
recruiter. I learned from a woman named
Jamie Toad Green who's like one of the
best recruiters in go to market in the
world. My average is 50%. It also means
you have to be as good at letting people
go at parting ways when it's not right
and doing that efficiently um as you are
at hiring. There was this really amazing
uh recruiter who I think was maybe the
first recruiter at Facebook um named
Andy Barton and he taught me a
psychological interview by doing one on
me where he he really I would call it
now I would call it a motivation
interview but a lot of what I do is just
try to understand people deeply. Who are
you? Where do you come from? You know
what what made you make the decisions
you've made? What have you learned? like
how do you talk about yourself and your
teams and really why are we even having
this conversation like what what brought
you to my front door and I remember
looking for one role I can't remember
what it was I think it was marketing and
I interviewed someone that I was like
this person is very talented like more
talented than anybody else I was talking
to and just came with a backpack full of
ego I I could feel it coming through the
Zoom you know what I mean and I was like
yeah this is not going to work like
you're so great and I just could not
hire you because you would destroy my
team and I it's not worth it to me
because I don't want to make the whole
company dysfunctional in order to have
this level of talent. You know,
&gt;&gt; we've had some hot takes recently on the
tenure for early stage executives. It's
 
What do you think about that?
&gt;&gt; I tell people 18 months. Like when I'm
helping CEOs build leadership teams,
like a lot of what I talk about is like
they're like five years from now and I'm
like, "Yeah, yeah, cute. 18 months." I
had a conversation once with John
Collison at Stripe and I was just I just
casually said, you know, look, there's
so much churn in early stage executives
teams. It's one of the most painful
phases and really most leaders don't
last more than two years. The exception
is the leader that lasts longer than two
years. John said to me, you know, that
really calmed down for us after a
thousand employees. And and then I
reflected on it and realized that was
true for Facebook too. like Facebook had
a huge amount of churn in the first um
the first thousand employees and then
they built a leadership team Cheryl and
Mark that stayed for ever like that it
was the same people for 10 years I think
so anyway I think there's just a huge
amount of churn and somewhat rightly so
if you're growing quickly in the sense
that like it's just hard for someone to
be as good at sort of the like 5 million
to 20 million to 50 million as they are
at 100 million plus in terms of revenue.
And then you know similarly like if
you're not growing sometimes you're
you've got people hitting the wrong nail
with the wrong tool. You know they're
using a p pony instead of a hammer or
whatever. So
&gt;&gt; totally.
&gt;&gt; And it makes sense. I mean you said
Facebook was a different company every
one to three months. Like totally
different company. I think that's
something I've seen is that people used
to feel bad about that and I think it's
it's not taboo anymore. Yeah. I'm here
for a certain phase. It's a tour of duty
and I'm moving on. And that used to be
not not a great gray look even like
five, six years ago.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. I think it's uh it's
complicated, but the best execs that I
work with, that I've hired, that I've
worked for, whatever, hold on to power
very loosely and are just like, listen,
I'm here while I'm the right person to
be here. I'm here to build the biggest
company I can build. And um at some
point if it's not me like that runs this
thing like great I'll find the right
person or I'll build the right team
under me or whatever you know.
&gt;&gt; I have one more quick one for you Molly.
What is the biggest misconception are
you seeing founders having around HR
leader roles? Chief people officers what
are you telling them?
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
Can I rephrase the question? It's
interesting. Can I'll just tell you the
question I want to answer which is like
what am I seeing founders want and ask
for that maybe isn't as common in the HR
space. Every founder I talk to right now
wants an operational head of people.
Meaning they want a head of people that
thinks about the business and
understands the business and understands
that at the end of the day they're not
responsible for employee happiness.
They're responsible for one of the
largest bud budget items inside the
company. um they're responsible for unit
economics because at the end of the day
like most companies most software
companies the two biggest expenses are
people and servers. Um you know
obviously if you have like a retail
business there's other costs but if
people are the biggest expense inside of
a company how do you as a people leader
think about running that the process of
filling those seats well um and being
economically and fiscally responsible to
the business and the business that needs
to be built. Um, I think sometimes we
uh have focused so much on happiness
that we've forgotten that everybody's
going to be unhappy if there's no
business. And uh I see founders pretty
desperate for partnership that
understands that at the end of the day,
this is a business and if the business
doesn't work, which there's a lot of
these days, um, no one has a job. So I
think that like for me if I were to like
gift something to the the sort of people
leaders of the world it would be an
understanding that everything has to be
business first. Um that doesn't mean you
people can't be happy. I actually think
people like winning number one. Growth
solves all problems right? Like people
like winning. They like being part of a
company that's winning. That makes
people happy first and foremost. Um and
so the business is there for everyone to
unite around and to try to solve
together. and a lot of other stuff is is
frankly a distraction. Um, and I think
that conversation is, you know, I guess
I've always sort of felt that way, but
it's really important these days
because, you know, somebody said to me
this week that there's they did math in
Pitchbook and there's 1,200 companies
that haven't raised uh and might go out
of business next year if they don't
raise. Um, and if that's true, then
there's going to be a lot of
acquisitions for sure, but there's also
going to be a lot of folks that can't
get acquired and aren't going to be able
to raise. And it just means that the
business of how people show up and how
they help build companies and how they
help companies achieve their goals is is
more important. Um, but it is at the end
of the day a part of a business. The
goal is to make the business thrive.
&gt;&gt; Could not agree more.
&gt;&gt; And the era of luxurious beliefs is
over.
Yeah, I mean I would just say the era of
excess is over, but yeah, for sure.
Turns out you turns out unit economics
matter. Who knew?
&gt;&gt; We're back. We're going to go through
our rapid fire questions. Um, and so I'm
I'm actually really curious about this
one for you because you've hired so many
great people. Who's your best hireer and
why?
&gt;&gt; Best hire? Come on. So many. No, I can't
do it.
&gt;&gt; Humble brag. Oh, there's so many. One
person.
&gt;&gt; No, no, it's not me. It's them. I'm I
like have gotten to work with so many
incredible people in my life and I it
would be like I don't even know picking
a favorite kid. They're all my favorite.
I love them. I've been I've learned I
don't even know. I couldn't answer the
question.
&gt;&gt; It is true. You have worked with amazing
people on your team. Um tell us about
the best interview question to get
signal on them.
&gt;&gt; Find your interview style and the one
that works for you. What I start with is
tell me your story. I love where they go
and it helps me. But that's because I'm
me and it's because I listen in a
certain way and I probe in a certain way
and I ask questions in a certain way.
&gt;&gt; I love that. Molly Graham, this was
amazing. Thank you so much for your
time.
&gt;&gt; So good. Thank you, Molly. Yeah, thanks
you guys. So fun.
