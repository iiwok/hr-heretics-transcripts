# Is Getting Promoted too Quickly A Widespread Problem in Startups?

## Transcript

 
all right Nolan we have a HR Heretics
segment here today we've gotten a lot of
questions from folks over the past 6
months since starting the show on how to
get promoted and potentially what can
happen if you get promoted too early in
some of these companies that are growing
very

fast
I think we have different takes on this
I'd love to hear yours and talk about
this for a few minutes yeah so uh the
the term we used to use earlier in my
career all the time was promotion
Obsession and it was it was this term
from HR to basically like the entire
company that was like we have a problem
because everyone wants to get promoted
and it's like well no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you have a
problem because the only way we're
giving out comp increases is if you get
promoted and so people become promotion
obsessed
when that is the way that they get paid
more or that's the way that they get
more responsibility or that's the way
that they get more decision making power
and so I think just with the way that we
structure companies today generally in
hierarchies people want to get promoted
so I'll just answer the question first
and then we can get into the other
topics um in general if you're earlier
in your career right getting a foot in
the door is the hardest thing so once
you get the foot in the door the next
thing is is make all of your manager and
your man managers managers problems go
away and just make them go away and be
available whenever they call text or
ping you and people are gonna hate that
advice because it's like oh like why you
that's the G it's a game it turns out
it's a game and if you solve those
people problem those people's problems
they will go to bat for you during
performance review time and that's what
I found in my career early in my career
that's the way that I ascended really
fast early on
and then later on it comes down to do
you have great relationships and are you
doing a phenomenal job in your role and
those are the things that I found in my
career I'm curious what you think Kelly
yeah I love I love how you actually
called it a game because in a lot of
ways that's not untrue and I think
sometimes people can take all this too
seriously I've always kind of gamified
anything right to keep things light and
this and that and you're right I mean
when I think about how I started intu
whatnot to get promoted is a is a is an
an act of executing doing your job
really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well without looking at
the next one or feeling like you should
have something else two is the
consistency of that execution and three
is your attitude and your relationships
right so if you're not executing but
also building relationships outside of
your team right outside of your function
and also having a good attitude I mean
they they would throw everything at me
like I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it
and all of a sudden you're doing things
that are sometimes two levels above your
you know whatever you're at and you're
already doing the job by the time you're
promoted and you don't even realize it
so there is this Obsession of of this
promotion and I don't mean not to think
about
it but I don't think that people realize
that doing great work and building
relationship ships with others
authentically you become this known
person right all of a sudden not in one
leadership meeting in like six different
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] leadership meetings across
different functions they're like who can
do this oh no one can do it no one can
do it no one can do it you're describing
I should have said me because the story
was about me but you're you're
describing corporate politics by the way
and one of my favorite stories I was in
uh my mid 20s and I was so like the way
that my brain works is like I'm focused
on the problem in front of me and
anything outside of the problem in front
of me I view as sometimes a
distraction and uh there was and I I
labeled those things as politics that
were in my way and distracting me from
doing really great work with all of my
energy that does not surprise me right
shocking so I got
feedback uh from my manager who this
feedback has like evolved in my head
over time as I've thought about it but
he said something so profound he said
Nolan if you don't like politics it
doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter because they're
everywhere and you better [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get
used to it that's so funny because I've
said my whole career that I hate
politics and maybe it's just because I
never thought about it as politics it is
Politics the relationship side it it
really is because like it takes like I
had to to to Really force myself because
I I will go and do the work and I will
just get hyperfocused on the work and I
will crush the work but you're right
these cross functional Partners like you
have to have relationships with them and
that's the stuff I learned later on yeah
I mean you said we tell the truth the
truth is you're not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get
promoted if people don't know about you
so like you have a hand to that your
manager has a hand in that representing
you in meetings visibility I mean these
things are just important and you can
avoid them and maybe you'll you'll do
great stuff and you said but if you're
if you're in a function that you know
works with other people mostly versus
right a master engineer you have to talk
to people and I also don't want to get
this like confused with slimy car
salesman like you have to also be
genuine because I have seen
all day long building relationships and
everyone's like they're full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so
you have to be consistent you have to be
authentic you have to execute and you
have to actually help others and build
relationships in a way that helps that
company outside of the role you're in
that that's that's the bottom line if
you're not doing that it's GNA be really
hard yeah I think there's a line I think
there's I think the line for how to
advocate for yourself um is really it's
like really
interesting and you know part of
advocating for yourself is building
relationships and solving problems that
are outside of your scope like that's
the that was my story and that's what I
had to learn and once I learned that I
was like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like there's a lot more
here that I'm unlocking yes um but I
think your point on the slimy car
salesman who we've all worked with I
think the Common Thread with that person
is number one they're not authentic like
they're full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nobody believes
them we could see right through them but
number two they're not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at
their job like the the foundation of the
thing is you crush your role like before
we talk about anything else like in
promotion you have to crush your role
you're right you're right cuz I was
viewed early on right I was 22 years old
and I was viewed as she's executor she's
doing great and that buys you right the
the the license to now have these
relationships right when I was 22 years
old into it and I emailed a VP to have
lunch he's not gonna have lunch with
someone who's falling on their face like
that's ridiculous one of my favorite say
is you have to earn the right to solve
the next problem and so when you're when
you're either starting in your career or
starting in a new role uh you know in
order to get promoted like you have to
earn the right to get promoted and the
way you earn that right is number one in
this disorder you crush your job and
your
responsibilities and number two you
build genuine lasting
relationships with your peers and cross
functional partners and like I'll add a
two-way to that that I've also learned
over time is maintain those
relationships over time because you have
no idea how small the world actually is
until you start to get higher in your
career and then it's like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like
yeah you know how many I mean we talk
about back channels all the time like we
get back channeled weekly yeah and to be
help other people like don't be a taker
I believe is a skill set not one that is
dis genuine or political necessarily but
it's really important and I i' I've
amazed at how many people do not know
how to do it it is nuanced I kind of
call it the six sense skill set and it's
like a right time right place right tone
right message kind of thing and it's
really important um and it's fun when
you get good at it it's actually really
fun that you increase your sense of
community and what not the organization

to Pivot really quick because I know
we're almost out of time I do want to
get your takal in on the potential
double-edged short of rising too fast in
some of these early stage high growth
companies and Venture I think it's made
up um you know I I think the common H
like that's what HR says in calibration
or that's what they say in in in U when
you're interviewing candidates and it's
like well we can't put them in a level
six versus a level five because if they
come in as a six and they don't succeed
we might have to fire them the they is
you by the way you were a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] HR you
I trust me I have reflected on things
I've said in the past and I hate myself
so this is one of those things I've
reflected on that I think is total
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which is like look if we have
data on someone and they are crushing it
and there is a j like there's a business
need or a next job and we need someone
to do it who better than the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
person that we have data on to put them
in that role and this whole like oh my
God what if they don't make it it's like
that's the case for everyone like if
they don't make it then we talk to them
about it we give them feedback on it we
give them an opportunity and then if
they're still not making it then we part
ways but like with high performers
that's almost never the case like I I
have yet to see outside of people
management which is what we have talked
about in a previous segment people
management is the one that I agree with
you on
is if we're moving from IC to people
management that's where I delineate but
I think this whole the one that's the
one I'm talking about right and I'm
talking about this talent that is all
they're very smart they're very
ambitious they move very fast they
execute like hell because that's what
you need to be inv Venture especially in
like series a series B companies that
are growing and all of a sudden I walk
into a company it's 38 people and I've
got like 25 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] VPS sitting there
and
what the hell's happened here over the
past few years and all then were're 700
people and now I've got 25 VPS and half
of them are way over their
 
skis H you know what I mean that that is
the the difference and not to say it's
okay or whatnot but I believe these
companies have to be prepared to now
have conversations which I've had
probably 50 times over the past 14 years
that we're going to have to hire over or
figure something out and helping those
folks understand that it's not
necessarily a bad thing so so that's so
okay so you're right the thing you're
talking about though is a business
scaling faster than a
person that's what I think you're
talking about yes and so my framework
for that I learned from Andre and
Horowitz and their recruiting team which
is you hire for the next 12 to 18
months and then if that crushes it
awesome now we give them the first right
of refusal to go solve the next problems
for the next 12 to 18 months if they
don't then we higher above them but I
don't think that's a promotion issue I
think that's a company scaling into new
problems issue okay okay I fair enough I
I am just imploring that companies think
about this because a lot of companies
don't think about it that way this is
back to Clarity of identity right I
haven't met one company that's done that
with people and all of a sudden they're
promoting people from ic's to VPS within
like two
years without those expectations right
and that that promotion too fast can
cause some of these very hairy
situations that might slow down the
business you're you're bringing up very
good examples and and I want to just
completely validate that these examples
are right I'm talking about like the L6
to L7 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I used to hear in
celebration the so here's you bring up a
good point on early
employee and you know Tony from door
Dash had this line too which is company
scale exponentially people scale
linearly that line like still to this
day pisses me off like Tony I love you
like I I think that's generally true um
but like talk about a way to fire up
like your top performers of like we're
going to prove you wrong and so if that
was what he was trying to do it worked
out really well because all of us
ultimately did scale but I hear you that
it does happen I've seen that happen but
I still think you have to earn the right
to solve that problem and if they can
solve the the job for 12 to 18 months
then the company has done its job and
the employee has done its job and if the
company keeps scaling beyond that skill
set that's a different problem outside
of fast promotions yeah and I think that
that talent to be open to if and when
that time comes and the company has
outscaled the person in the that job at
that moment because no human can develop
that quickly I think the mindset needs
to shift of that talent that like yes
you might be getting hired over you you
you've created this you've won you've
you've built this and it's not that your
role is getting smaller it's actually
getting bigger because the world around
you is now getting bigger so this is
like getting into like Nolan's therapy
session but like the um I'm not getting
paid for that so isn't it funny how
Founders can scale with the company but
like you know other people can't I've
always just like given that I've been an
early employee a few times I've always
found that dichotomy really interesting
and but they can't that's the dirty
secret is when a Founder is not doing
well and a company's 2,000 people
Everyone [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knows but Kelly there's
many examples of I mean Jeff Bezos Tony
they're not doing well but but these are
founders who went from zero to multiple
billions so it does happen and and again
I think I think on this leaders too
underneath that's my point that's
exactly my point is like it's not a
unique to the founder thing like oh only
the founder can scale as fast as the
company like I I do believe this is
where like early
employees sometimes get the wrong end of
the stick because the CEO gets really
excited about the oh let's hire this sea
level who's been at the big company
who's got a bunch of people reporting to
them and be careful what you wish for
and don't forget who got you to where
you are today because big company Bob
who comes in doesn't always hit Grand
Slams or Barbara or Barbara yeah so
anyways uh Point well taken 100% yeah
all right give us your feedback let us
know what you guys think thanks
