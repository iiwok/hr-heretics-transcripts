Sama, what's up man? It's good to see
 
Sama, what's up man? It's good to see
you. Dolan, good to see you too. So, you
 
you. Dolan, good to see you too. So, you
were the chief people officer at Zapier
 
were the chief people officer at Zapier
and as someone who is terminally online
 
and as someone who is terminally online
and looking for people talking about AI.
 
and looking for people talking about AI.
I started noticing like a few months
 
I started noticing like a few months
ago, call like January, February, your
 
ago, call like January, February, your
posting started to take off and you were
 
posting started to take off and you were
talking a lot about AI. And so, I pinged
 
talking a lot about AI. And so, I pinged
you a couple weeks ago specifically when
 
you a couple weeks ago specifically when
you said something about like the
 
you said something about like the
adoption numbers at Zapier and how many
 
adoption numbers at Zapier and how many
employees were using AI. And then you
 
employees were using AI. And then you
had also then said, "Oh, it turns out
 
had also then said, "Oh, it turns out
like my team is using it for a bunch of
 
like my team is using it for a bunch of
stuff." So today's episode is going to
 
stuff." So today's episode is going to
be like a triple click into how Zapier
 
be like a triple click into how Zapier
is using AI, how the people team is
 
is using AI, how the people team is
using it, how you're getting people to
 
using it, how you're getting people to
buy in and all of those things. So if
 
buy in and all of those things. So if
you are listening to this, Brandon has
 
you are listening to this, Brandon has
kindly offered to share his screen and
 
kindly offered to share his screen and
give us a look behind the curtain. So
 
give us a look behind the curtain. So
please do go watch if you can. But
 
please do go watch if you can. But
Brandon, where I want to start with you
 
Brandon, where I want to start with you
is talk about like AI fluency and you
 
is talk about like AI fluency and you
had said on LinkedIn that AI fluency is
 
had said on LinkedIn that AI fluency is
a requirement for 100% of new hires at
 
a requirement for 100% of new hires at
Zapier.
 
Zapier.
Why is that the case and how do you guys
 
Why is that the case and how do you guys
go about measuring that? AI fluency is a
 
go about measuring that? AI fluency is a
requirement for everyone we're hiring
 
requirement for everyone we're hiring
into the company for a couple reasons.
 
into the company for a couple reasons.
The first is it's essential for
 
The first is it's essential for
fulfilling our mission, right? Zapier's
 
fulfilling our mission, right? Zapier's
mission is to make automation work for
 
mission is to make automation work for
everyone and AI is a meaningful new way
 
everyone and AI is a meaningful new way
for us to make that mission real for so
 
for us to make that mission real for so
many more people and everyone in this
 
many more people and everyone in this
company I mean we hire somebody they're
 
company I mean we hire somebody they're
contributing to the mission and AI is a
 
contributing to the mission and AI is a
amazing way to do that so it's a
 
amazing way to do that so it's a
requirement I will tell you that a
 
requirement I will tell you that a
second reason why that matters to me is
 
second reason why that matters to me is
more about like Zapier's
 
more about like Zapier's
tacit commitment to people we hire
 
tacit commitment to people we hire
you know, when we I mean, it's it's true
 
you know, when we I mean, it's it's true
for the team we already have, but it's
 
for the team we already have, but it's
definitely true for every new person
 
definitely true for every new person
that joins the company. You think about
 
that joins the company. You think about
if you're in the job market right now
 
if you're in the job market right now
and you're thinking about whether to go
 
and you're thinking about whether to go
to this company or that company, you
 
to this company or that company, you
know, a lot of us have a leading sense
 
know, a lot of us have a leading sense
that wherever we spend the next few
 
that wherever we spend the next few
years of our career is going to have a
 
years of our career is going to have a
lot to do with the kind of opportunities
 
lot to do with the kind of opportunities
we have for many years after that. And
 
we have for many years after that. And
gosh, I would really encourage all of us
 
gosh, I would really encourage all of us
if when we're back in the market, like
 
if when we're back in the market, like
make sure we go somewhere where that's
 
make sure we go somewhere where that's
actively investing in making sure that
 
actively investing in making sure that
we know how to use AI to supercharge the
 
we know how to use AI to supercharge the
thing that we do best in the world or at
 
thing that we do best in the world or at
least at work, right? That's kind of
 
least at work, right? That's kind of
that's that's the big idea. So you know
 
that's that's the big idea. So you know
kind of whether you look at it from that
 
kind of whether you look at it from that
first angle like mission product
 
first angle like mission product
customer or from this adjacent angle
 
customer or from this adjacent angle
around just gosh I want to be one of the
 
around just gosh I want to be one of the
companies I want to work at a company
 
companies I want to work at a company
where we can look someone in the eyes
 
where we can look someone in the eyes
and say you know the next two or three
 
and say you know the next two or three
years of your career if you're thinking
 
years of your career if you're thinking
about joining is time really well spent
 
about joining is time really well spent
because of this investment that we're
 
because of this investment that we're
making now you got to come to the table
 
making now you got to come to the table
with some skills and curiosity too but
 
with some skills and curiosity too but
it's a handshake I was listening to a
 
it's a handshake I was listening to a
podcast on the way up to the city today
 
podcast on the way up to the city today
and similar thing that a company was
 
and similar thing that a company was
saying It's a requirement for folks to
 
saying It's a requirement for folks to
come in with some sort of AI. You know,
 
come in with some sort of AI. You know,
I'll use fluidity because we're using it
 
I'll use fluidity because we're using it
here. But their bar was curiosity. And
 
here. But their bar was curiosity. And
I'm wondering if yours is something
 
I'm wondering if yours is something
different or like do I have to do
 
different or like do I have to do
something, prove something, show
 
something, prove something, show
something, or do I just have to be
 
something, or do I just have to be
curious? You have to be a little bit
 
curious? You have to be a little bit
more than curious to get a job at
 
more than curious to get a job at
Zapier. But I appreciate that as a
 
Zapier. But I appreciate that as a
starting condition. And in fact, like
 
starting condition. And in fact, like
some maybe accidental skillfulness with
 
some maybe accidental skillfulness with
AI and a lack of curiosity is also not
 
AI and a lack of curiosity is also not
okay. So I would call a curiosity like
 
okay. So I would call a curiosity like
necessary but not sufficient if that
 
necessary but not sufficient if that
makes sense. At Zapier we have kind of
 
makes sense. At Zapier we have kind of
like four levels on our AI fluency
 
like four levels on our AI fluency
rubric. And the first is unacceptable.
 
rubric. And the first is unacceptable.
It just means you just you're not both
 
It just means you just you're not both
from a skill and from a will perspective
 
from a skill and from a will perspective
like you're you're kind of starting from
 
like you're you're kind of starting from
nowhere. We don't have a lot we think we
 
nowhere. We don't have a lot we think we
can work with. The second is capable.
 
can work with. The second is capable.
And when we mean capable, that means
 
And when we mean capable, that means
like you have some of the skills and
 
like you have some of the skills and
some of the knowhow of like how to apply
 
some of the knowhow of like how to apply
AI in your daily work,
 
AI in your daily work,
but you may not be using it robustly to
 
but you may not be using it robustly to
actually measurably improve your daily
 
actually measurably improve your daily
work. And that's where the the third and
 
work. And that's where the the third and
next level in the rubric comes up.
 
next level in the rubric comes up.
That's called adaptive. So whereas
 
That's called adaptive. So whereas
capable is like you may technically have
 
capable is like you may technically have
some knowhow, but you haven't really
 
some knowhow, but you haven't really
deeply applied it yet. adopted is oh no
 
deeply applied it yet. adopted is oh no
you're applying it but you're applying
 
you're applying it but you're applying
it primarily to the work as it's
 
it primarily to the work as it's
conventionally done
 
conventionally done
so it's like you know the work is
 
so it's like you know the work is
traditionally done a certain way I'm
 
traditionally done a certain way I'm
using AI to practically improve my
 
using AI to practically improve my
productivity or the quality of my output
 
productivity or the quality of my output
and by the way like that's pretty
 
and by the way like that's pretty
impactful
 
impactful
but it gets even better because the top
 
but it gets even better because the top
tier in the AI fluency rubric is called
 
tier in the AI fluency rubric is called
transformational and that's for folks
 
transformational and that's for folks
that are showing us that not only do
 
that are showing us that not only do
they know how to use AI to impact the
 
they know how to use AI to impact the
work they do as it's traditionally done.
 
work they do as it's traditionally done.
They are also able to completely rethink
 
They are also able to completely rethink
how the work gets done in the first
 
how the work gets done in the first
place. So it's almost like a like a
 
place. So it's almost like a like a
clean s. You still have the same
 
clean s. You still have the same
outcomes, same bar of quality for craft
 
outcomes, same bar of quality for craft
and output, customer impact and so on,
 
and output, customer impact and so on,
but you're starting more from, you know,
 
but you're starting more from, you know,
like you're kind of zerobasing the whole
 
like you're kind of zerobasing the whole
thing and being like, gosh, if we were
 
thing and being like, gosh, if we were
to start from scratch with the tools and
 
to start from scratch with the tools and
know how we now have, how would we do
 
know how we now have, how would we do
this work? which also sometimes inspires
 
this work? which also sometimes inspires
some fresh thinking about like how the
 
some fresh thinking about like how the
jobs get designed or who collaborates
 
jobs get designed or who collaborates
with who and why and folks who can speak
 
with who and why and folks who can speak
at that level that's more of a like a
 
at that level that's more of a like a
systems way of thinking about how AI can
 
systems way of thinking about how AI can
get a certain type of outcomes alongside
 
get a certain type of outcomes alongside
the humans and that we reserve for our
 
the humans and that we reserve for our
top tier transformative. Thank you for
 
top tier transformative. Thank you for
breaking that down. A lot of the issues
 
breaking that down. A lot of the issues
I see out there right now is just
 
I see out there right now is just
literally like an inability to simply
 
literally like an inability to simply
break things down so we can touch it and
 
break things down so we can touch it and
feel it and that's really helpful.
 
feel it and that's really helpful.
Absolutely. Well, I would tell you too,
 
Absolutely. Well, I would tell you too,
you asked a second question within that,
 
you asked a second question within that,
which is like, is that bar kind of the
 
which is like, is that bar kind of the
same for everyone at Zapier, and that's
 
same for everyone at Zapier, and that's
a question we don't have like a super
 
a question we don't have like a super
crisp answer to yet. Our leading sense
 
crisp answer to yet. Our leading sense
is the way that manifests is going to
 
is the way that manifests is going to
look somewhat different. Um, much in the
 
look somewhat different. Um, much in the
same way a lot of performance
 
same way a lot of performance
expectations, you know, look different
 
expectations, you know, look different
in practice. The expectation like
 
in practice. The expectation like
boilerplate may be the same. It could be
 
boilerplate may be the same. It could be
like we believe it's important that
 
like we believe it's important that
everyone in the company be able to like
 
everyone in the company be able to like
solve problems, right? So, we get to say
 
solve problems, right? So, we get to say
problem solving, right? Right? It's
 
problem solving, right? Right? It's
like, well, what does that look like?
 
like, well, what does that look like?
It's like, well, in practice, that looks
 
It's like, well, in practice, that looks
a little bit different for a developer
 
a little bit different for a developer
than it does for a recruiter. That makes
 
than it does for a recruiter. That makes
sense. All right. Well, let's get into
 
sense. All right. Well, let's get into
the meat of this, and I want you to show
 
the meat of this, and I want you to show
some of the things you talked about on
 
some of the things you talked about on
LinkedIn. So, a couple of things I saw
 
LinkedIn. So, a couple of things I saw
that I was curious about was I think you
 
that I was curious about was I think you
had talked about like hiring prep being
 
had talked about like hiring prep being
one of these. You talked about
 
one of these. You talked about
onboarding. So, how are you guys
 
onboarding. So, how are you guys
deploying AI and what do you think are
 
deploying AI and what do you think are
like the most interesting use cases you
 
like the most interesting use cases you
want to show? Sure. We'll give you a few
 
want to show? Sure. We'll give you a few
examples. Let's you know one of Zapier's
 
examples. Let's you know one of Zapier's
kind of norms is a show is greater than
 
kind of norms is a show is greater than
tell. So let's do some got a few few
 
tell. So let's do some got a few few
things for us here. So let me quickly
 
things for us here. So let me quickly
make
 
make
let me quickly make one point which is
 
let me quickly make one point which is
that not every
 
that not every
use case that has value at Zapier from a
 
use case that has value at Zapier from a
talent perspective includes AI. In fact,
 
talent perspective includes AI. In fact,
there are some cases where we
 
there are some cases where we
intentionally do not integrate AI into a
 
intentionally do not integrate AI into a
workflow. And I'll I'll give you two
 
workflow. And I'll I'll give you two
examples and I'll explain why. And then
 
examples and I'll explain why. And then
we'll do some AI powered use cases as
 
we'll do some AI powered use cases as
well. So in this first example, this is
 
well. So in this first example, this is
at the very beginning of the employee
 
at the very beginning of the employee
experience. Someone joins the team,
 
experience. Someone joins the team,
right? This is one of those classic
 
right? This is one of those classic
moments that matter. And practically, I
 
moments that matter. And practically, I
would really like to welcome everyone to
 
would really like to welcome everyone to
the company when they join. We do not do
 
the company when they join. We do not do
new hire orientation in person. Zap year
 
new hire orientation in person. Zap year
is all remote and always has been. We
 
is all remote and always has been. We
have folks in 42 countries. So, new hire
 
have folks in 42 countries. So, new hire
experience is is virtual. And so, I have
 
experience is is virtual. And so, I have
a I have an automation set up. All it
 
a I have an automation set up. All it
does is it looks out for someone when
 
does is it looks out for someone when
they start in our HIS.
 
they start in our HIS.
When that happens, it triggers a lookup
 
When that happens, it triggers a lookup
of their Slack handle and then it sends
 
of their Slack handle and then it sends
a message from me to them like the one
 
a message from me to them like the one
on the right hand side here welcoming
 
on the right hand side here welcoming
them to the team. So, let me make two
 
them to the team. So, let me make two
points about this one. One, I want this
 
points about this one. One, I want this
to work exactly the same way every time.
 
to work exactly the same way every time.
So, it doesn't include AI steps.
 
So, it doesn't include AI steps.
Now, at scale, this isn't massive scale,
 
Now, at scale, this isn't massive scale,
but at scale, this would also be a less
 
but at scale, this would also be a less
costly workflow to run than if it
 
costly workflow to run than if it
included a bunch of AI stuff. So,
 
included a bunch of AI stuff. So,
there's a little bit of that in there,
 
there's a little bit of that in there,
too, which is like AI is amazing for a
 
too, which is like AI is amazing for a
lot of use cases. If you don't have to
 
lot of use cases. If you don't have to
use it at scale, it can be less costly
 
use it at scale, it can be less costly
not to. But the second point I want to
 
not to. But the second point I want to
make, and it's actually kind of
 
make, and it's actually kind of
interesting, is that, you know, you
 
interesting, is that, you know, you
could look at this use case and say,
 
could look at this use case and say,
Brandon, that's so damn impersonal,
 
Brandon, that's so damn impersonal,
right? Like, it's like a welcome message
 
right? Like, it's like a welcome message
to folks, but it's but it's an
 
to folks, but it's but it's an
automation,
 
automation,
right? Here's the here's the thing. Like
 
right? Here's the here's the thing. Like
this is a this is a matter of reference
 
this is a this is a matter of reference
points. If your reference point is, you
 
points. If your reference point is, you
know, someone in my shoes handcrafting a
 
know, someone in my shoes handcrafting a
note to every person that joins, then
 
note to every person that joins, then
maybe this does look less personalized.
 
maybe this does look less personalized.
By the way, I don't know almost all
 
By the way, I don't know almost all
these people, so I don't know how much
 
these people, so I don't know how much
personalization can really happen at
 
personalization can really happen at
this step, if that makes sense. So, I
 
this step, if that makes sense. So, I
would kind of kind of push on that
 
would kind of kind of push on that
notion that I could make it a lot more
 
notion that I could make it a lot more
personal even if I was doing this by
 
personal even if I was doing this by
hand. But the more important point is
 
hand. But the more important point is
that the right reference point or
 
that the right reference point or
alternative here isn't me writing these
 
alternative here isn't me writing these
by hand. It's me not writing them at all
 
by hand. It's me not writing them at all
or it not happening at all. Like this is
 
or it not happening at all. Like this is
not something I could possibly make time
 
not something I could possibly make time
for. Or your EA doing it which is like
 
for. Or your EA doing it which is like
it's the same thing. Yeah. Which also
 
it's the same thing. Yeah. Which also
like great use of their time either.
 
like great use of their time either.
Like we have some just like incredible
 
Like we have some just like incredible
EAS who actually use a lot of AI and
 
EAS who actually use a lot of AI and
automation. Like it's next level stuff.
 
automation. Like it's next level stuff.
That could be your next podcast. They
 
That could be your next podcast. They
have someone from our EA team on. It's
 
have someone from our EA team on. It's
incredible. But in any case, it's pure
 
incredible. But in any case, it's pure
automation. It's a moment that matters.
 
automation. It's a moment that matters.
The alternative is not doing it at all.
 
The alternative is not doing it at all.
So, we're good. Here's the second one at
 
So, we're good. Here's the second one at
the other end of the employee
 
the other end of the employee
experience. So, in this one,
 
experience. So, in this one,
someone has left the company.
 
someone has left the company.
Now, there's a lot of fanfare. You know,
 
Now, there's a lot of fanfare. You know,
folks leave on great terms. We send them
 
folks leave on great terms. We send them
off in style. You know, a lot of love
 
off in style. You know, a lot of love
like right when they're leaving and then
 
like right when they're leaving and then
you go off. Maybe you're doing a job
 
you go off. Maybe you're doing a job
search. Maybe you're in your new job.
 
search. Maybe you're in your new job.
you you can start to lose a sense of
 
you you can start to lose a sense of
connection to the team. What this
 
connection to the team. What this
automation does is it looks for folks
 
automation does is it looks for folks
who left the company on good terms.
 
who left the company on good terms.
It then waits 60 days and after 60 days
 
It then waits 60 days and after 60 days
passes, it drafts a note from me to them
 
passes, it drafts a note from me to them
and it puts it in the drafts folder of
 
and it puts it in the drafts folder of
my inbox.
 
my inbox.
Now, these are people who have worked
 
Now, these are people who have worked
with us. These are people who I know and
 
with us. These are people who I know and
these are people I do not want to send a
 
these are people I do not want to send a
boilerplate email to. That's why it ends
 
boilerplate email to. That's why it ends
up in my drafts. there's a human in the
 
up in my drafts. there's a human in the
loop in this workflow. So, it also sends
 
loop in this workflow. So, it also sends
me a reminder to let me know that
 
me a reminder to let me know that
there's stuff in my drafts folder to
 
there's stuff in my drafts folder to
look through. So, I pop in depending on
 
look through. So, I pop in depending on
how I how well I know that person, I'm
 
how I how well I know that person, I'm
I'm going to tailor that thing. Uh, but
 
I'm going to tailor that thing. Uh, but
I've got a running start. And
 
I've got a running start. And
importantly, I'm not pulling manual
 
importantly, I'm not pulling manual
reports and trying to figure out who
 
reports and trying to figure out who
left and who left on good terms. Was it
 
left and who left on good terms. Was it
this type of exit or that type of exit?
 
this type of exit or that type of exit?
It all happens automatically.
 
It all happens automatically.
And I just really I really value this
 
And I just really I really value this
one. It's a really nice way to stay in
 
one. It's a really nice way to stay in
touch. like it makes my day when I hear
 
touch. like it makes my day when I hear
back from folks and you know get replies
 
back from folks and you know get replies
like the one that you can see here in
 
like the one that you can see here in
the middle of the screen grab. But just
 
the middle of the screen grab. But just
again another way to use you know
 
again another way to use you know
automation or or AI for a moment that
 
automation or or AI for a moment that
matters. Although interestingly for this
 
matters. Although interestingly for this
one I also don't want to editorialize
 
one I also don't want to editorialize
with AI. So this one is also pure pure
 
with AI. So this one is also pure pure
automation. That one's really just to
 
automation. That one's really just to
take a beat on that one. That one's
 
take a beat on that one. That one's
really interesting because what you're
 
really interesting because what you're
saying there is that's all happening
 
saying there is that's all happening
automatically. Like you're not even like
 
automatically. Like you're not even like
initiating that zap by yourself. That's
 
initiating that zap by yourself. That's
just like, hey, I've done this thing one
 
just like, hey, I've done this thing one
time and now every time somebody leaves
 
time and now every time somebody leaves
who we consider regrettable, this draft
 
who we consider regrettable, this draft
shows up in your inbox 60 days after the
 
shows up in your inbox 60 days after the
day they left. Yeah, correct. That's
 
day they left. Yeah, correct. That's
dope. I love that idea. So, and you
 
dope. I love that idea. So, and you
know, the other neat thing about
 
know, the other neat thing about
workflows like these and really
 
workflows like these and really
everything else we're about to to demo
 
everything else we're about to to demo
here is these types of workflows are
 
here is these types of workflows are
created by practitioners,
 
created by practitioners,
not engineers or it or whatever the case
 
not engineers or it or whatever the case
may be, you know, these are created by
 
may be, you know, these are created by
folks who like have craft right in the
 
folks who like have craft right in the
area of talent, employee experience,
 
area of talent, employee experience,
recruiting, onboarding and so on. And
 
recruiting, onboarding and so on. And

Now let's bridge from automation into AI
 
Now let's bridge from automation into AI
and automation. Got another one here.
 
and automation. Got another one here.
Okay. So now what we're looking at is
 
Okay. So now what we're looking at is
Zapier agents,
 
Zapier agents,
right? And just to define agents really
 
right? And just to define agents really
quickly. Agent has the kind of
 
quickly. Agent has the kind of
underlying LLM capability that we all
 
underlying LLM capability that we all
know and love, but with the ability to
 
know and love, but with the ability to
automate tasks on your behalf and in
 
automate tasks on your behalf and in
some cases also with like a
 
some cases also with like a
self-improvement layer. This one does
 
self-improvement layer. This one does
not include like a self-improvement
 
not include like a self-improvement
layer. So this is what we're looking at
 
layer. So this is what we're looking at
here. But before we get into what it is,
 
here. But before we get into what it is,
let's talk about what we're solving for.
 
let's talk about what we're solving for.
So at Zapier, like many organizations,
 
So at Zapier, like many organizations,
we do a bar raiser interview. This is a
 
we do a bar raiser interview. This is a
this is intended both to apply
 
this is intended both to apply
additional rigor to hiring. We don't
 
additional rigor to hiring. We don't
hire a lot of people every year. So
 
hire a lot of people every year. So
everyone should be amazing. A bar
 
everyone should be amazing. A bar
raising addition to the team. And
 
raising addition to the team. And
importantly, it's it's done by an exec.
 
importantly, it's it's done by an exec.
And the other reason, the reason we do
 
And the other reason, the reason we do
that isn't just because like execs are
 
that isn't just because like execs are
the only ones that know what greatness
 
the only ones that know what greatness
looks like. No, that's not really it.
 
looks like. No, that's not really it.
It's also we want to make sure that
 
It's also we want to make sure that
everyone joins the company has an
 
everyone joins the company has an
opportunity to meet with some of the
 
opportunity to meet with some of the
most senior leaders on the team to get
 
most senior leaders on the team to get
any question they conceivably have
 
any question they conceivably have
answered by someone who's kind of
 
answered by someone who's kind of
looking over like a huge piece of the
 
looking over like a huge piece of the
company and also on their first day to
 
company and also on their first day to
know that they're coming in and they
 
know that they're coming in and they
have a pre-existing relationship with at
 
have a pre-existing relationship with at
least one exec on the team. So these are
 
least one exec on the team. So these are
the reasons why yeah why we do the
 
the reasons why yeah why we do the
barrazer is that sea level exec or VP
 
barrazer is that sea level exec or VP
plus like how do you guys think about
 
plus like how do you guys think about
it? It's VP plus yeah it's like
 
it? It's VP plus yeah it's like
department heads effectively and and
 
department heads effectively and and
just contextually how many employees is
 
just contextually how many employees is
Zapier? 730 730 and how many VPs do you
 
Zapier? 730 730 and how many VPs do you
guys have? VP plus we have 10. Wow.
 
guys have? VP plus we have 10. Wow.
Okay. Interesting. Cool. Yeah that's one
 
Okay. Interesting. Cool. Yeah that's one
of the things I observed when I joined
 
of the things I observed when I joined
Zapier is like well look at that is like
 
Zapier is like well look at that is like
genuine job level discipline. Like I
 
genuine job level discipline. Like I
love that. Yeah, that was like my
 
love that. Yeah, that was like my
eyebrows just raised.
 
eyebrows just raised.
Love to see that. Now, as great as these
 
Love to see that. Now, as great as these
bar raiser interviews are, they're a
 
bar raiser interviews are, they're a
bear to prepare for when you're like a
 
bear to prepare for when you're like a
a, you know, a a busy exec because
 
a, you know, a a busy exec because
you're supposed to be looking across all
 
you're supposed to be looking across all
of the prior interviews and scorecards
 
of the prior interviews and scorecards
and identifying like specific things to
 
and identifying like specific things to
dig into, little gaps in our
 
dig into, little gaps in our
understanding, things worth
 
understanding, things worth
understanding more. like we're really
 
understanding more. like we're really
trying to, you know, like this is it.
 
trying to, you know, like this is it.
This is the last conversation before we
 
This is the last conversation before we
make a hiring decision. So, we want to
 
make a hiring decision. So, we want to
be like pretty thorough. The the nonI
 
be like pretty thorough. The the nonI
assisted way of doing this looks like
 
assisted way of doing this looks like
going through all of the scorecards,
 
going through all of the scorecards,
you know, who knows in what particular
 
you know, who knows in what particular
order. It's a human workflow, right? So,
 
order. It's a human workflow, right? So,
maybe I'm going from the top to from the
 
maybe I'm going from the top to from the
earliest to the latest from the latest
 
earliest to the latest from the latest
to the earliest. It's very inconsistent
 
to the earliest. It's very inconsistent
in practice when you watch, you know,
 
in practice when you watch, you know,
folks like me prepare for a bar raiser.
 
folks like me prepare for a bar raiser.
there's recency bias. Like maybe I'm
 
there's recency bias. Like maybe I'm
reading quickly through this scorecard
 
reading quickly through this scorecard
and stopping more on this one. Like who
 
and stopping more on this one. Like who
knows? Like you know it's you know human
 
knows? Like you know it's you know human
humans are messy and so is preparing for
 
humans are messy and so is preparing for
a bar raiser without a co-pilot. I've
 
a bar raiser without a co-pilot. I've
had this experience a million times by
 
had this experience a million times by
the way. Like a million. You're
 
the way. Like a million. You're
describing it's like oh hey Nolan has to
 
describing it's like oh hey Nolan has to
interview this person and five minutes
 
interview this person and five minutes
before is when I'm scrambling and
 
before is when I'm scrambling and
looking at their LinkedIn and trying to
 
looking at their LinkedIn and trying to
get my act together. That's right.
 
get my act together. That's right.
That's exactly right. And so what this
 
That's exactly right. And so what this
agent does is I will point it at a
 
agent does is I will point it at a
series of scorecards for a fictional
 
series of scorecards for a fictional
candidate that we'll look at in a second
 
candidate that we'll look at in a second
and it will draft the bar raiser
 
and it will draft the bar raiser
interview guide based on the prompt that
 
interview guide based on the prompt that
you see here. So again, kind of in the
 
you see here. So again, kind of in the
middle pane, you see the instructions
 
middle pane, you see the instructions
we're giving the agent. Let me do a
 
we're giving the agent. Let me do a
little explainer here, but let's
 
little explainer here, but let's
actually start with the trigger. So this
 
actually start with the trigger. So this
is what makes an agent different than
 
is what makes an agent different than
like a just a typical LLM or kind of
 
like a just a typical LLM or kind of
chatbot or what have you. Here in this
 
chatbot or what have you. Here in this
trigger, it is looking for me to tell it
 
trigger, it is looking for me to tell it
to look at the screen effectively. And
 
to look at the screen effectively. And
what I am then doing, here you go. Yeah,
 
what I am then doing, here you go. Yeah,
there it is. Is uh giving it
 
there it is. Is uh giving it
instructions for what to do once I
 
instructions for what to do once I
trigger it. In this case, it's take a
 
trigger it. In this case, it's take a
look at all these summaries, make
 
look at all these summaries, make
questions for a bar raiser,
 
questions for a bar raiser,
give some prompts for like what to look
 
give some prompts for like what to look
for, what we're really trying to do
 
for, what we're really trying to do
here, and some suggestions.
 
here, and some suggestions.
And then at the bottom, importantly, you
 
And then at the bottom, importantly, you
can just basically tell it. And once you
 
can just basically tell it. And once you
do that, please create a Google doc with
 
do that, please create a Google doc with
the interview guide. So that's the last
 
the interview guide. So that's the last
step that you see right there.
 
step that you see right there.
So why don't we point it at a fictional
 
So why don't we point it at a fictional
candidate and take a look.
 
candidate and take a look.
So here's a fictional candidate. If you
 
So here's a fictional candidate. If you
like the show Parks and Wreck, you will
 
like the show Parks and Wreck, you will
recognize this candidate.
 
So this has fictional scorecards like
 
So this has fictional scorecards like
all up and down. has our typical
 
all up and down. has our typical
interview stages in it with interview
 
interview stages in it with interview
notes and feedback and things of that
 
notes and feedback and things of that
nature. What I'm going to do now is pull
 
nature. What I'm going to do now is pull
up Zapier agents in my browser plugin.
 
up Zapier agents in my browser plugin.
I've got my barrazer interview agent
 
I've got my barrazer interview agent
right here and I'm going to hit run.
 
That's the trigger. It's reading all of
 
That's the trigger. It's reading all of
the data in this browser tab about
 
the data in this browser tab about
Leslie and everything we know about her
 
Leslie and everything we know about her
from our interviews. It's also looking
 
from our interviews. It's also looking
at her resume and it's creating the
 
at her resume and it's creating the
interview guide. Now, just like Martha
 
interview guide. Now, just like Martha
Stewart, I have the finished product in
 
Stewart, I have the finished product in
the oven. I'm about to pull it out. So,
 
the oven. I'm about to pull it out. So,
while that's doing that, I'll show you
 
while that's doing that, I'll show you
what the what the output is on the next
 
what the what the output is on the next
tab here.
 
And what's interesting about this one is
 
And what's interesting about this one is
it's been it's been prompted to not only
 
it's been it's been prompted to not only
add questions that'll help us like
 
add questions that'll help us like
really round out our perspective on the
 
really round out our perspective on the
candidate, but it's explaining why it
 
candidate, but it's explaining why it
chose that question. That's incredible
 
chose that question. That's incredible
because before I saw this, I was like,
 
because before I saw this, I was like,
the questions are great, but you're
 
the questions are great, but you're
still flying blind. Like, why are we
 
still flying blind. Like, why are we
doing this? What are we worried about?
 
doing this? What are we worried about?
What are we trying to validate or
 
What are we trying to validate or
devalidate? That's right. And if you
 
devalidate? That's right. And if you
wanted even more context on why each of
 
wanted even more context on why each of
these questions was chosen, you could
 
these questions was chosen, you could
pop right back in here. And this is
 
pop right back in here. And this is
where like the the iteration speed of
 
where like the the iteration speed of
iteration is so fast. Like if you were
 
iteration is so fast. Like if you were
testing this and you were like, you
 
testing this and you were like, you
know, I'd like a like an extra sentence
 
know, I'd like a like an extra sentence
or or bit of material on why each of
 
or or bit of material on why each of
these questions was chosen or from
 
these questions was chosen or from
exactly what interview it was
 
exactly what interview it was
referencing when it came up with this
 
referencing when it came up with this
question. All you got to do is come
 
question. All you got to do is come
right back on here and update your
 
right back on here and update your
prompt and then retest it. Takes takes
 
prompt and then retest it. Takes takes
three or four minutes. And so Brandon,
 
three or four minutes. And so Brandon,
there's like a spectrum here for so the
 
there's like a spectrum here for so the
the way I'm thinking about this. So some
 
the way I'm thinking about this. So some
companies for their bar raiser interview
 
companies for their bar raiser interview
have like the exact same questions, but
 
have like the exact same questions, but
it doesn't change the fact that you
 
it doesn't change the fact that you
actually want the full download of
 
actually want the full download of
what's happened in every conversation.
 
what's happened in every conversation.
So, in a in a different I met with Joe
 
So, in a in a different I met with Joe
Ed recently who runs he runs recruiting
 
Ed recently who runs he runs recruiting
at HPIQ and one of the things I learned
 
at HPIQ and one of the things I learned
from him is they're actually recording
 
from him is they're actually recording
all of the interviews with Metaview
 
all of the interviews with Metaview
taking the transcript putting the
 
taking the transcript putting the
transcript into chat GPT and then with
 
transcript into chat GPT and then with
the backend prompts basically like
 
the backend prompts basically like
saying like here's context on our org on
 
saying like here's context on our org on
our product on the team what each team
 
our product on the team what each team
member does what do you think how do you
 
member does what do you think how do you
think they're going to fit in what are
 
think they're going to fit in what are
the yellow flags, what are the green
 
the yellow flags, what are the green
flags, what are the red flags, that's
 
flags, what are the red flags, that's
like really far down on the on the
 
like really far down on the on the
spectrum. But another spectrum is is
 
spectrum. But another spectrum is is
just like to get this thing up and
 
just like to get this thing up and
running is just like go summarize these
 
running is just like go summarize these
interviews, tell me about this candidate
 
interviews, tell me about this candidate
via the resume, right? And you could do
 
via the resume, right? And you could do
that with one click every single time,
 
that with one click every single time,
you know, an hour before an interview.
 
you know, an hour before an interview.
And so there's just so many different
 
And so there's just so many different
ways that you can actually tinker with
 
ways that you can actually tinker with
this thing, right? 100%. You also have a
 
this thing, right? 100%. You also have a
lot of choices around how much of the
 
lot of choices around how much of the
human you want in the loop. So, if
 
human you want in the loop. So, if
you've been paying attention to the very
 
you've been paying attention to the very
right hand side of my screen, you'll
 
right hand side of my screen, you'll
notice that after it generated the
 
notice that after it generated the
interview guide, it stopped. It hasn't
 
interview guide, it stopped. It hasn't
created the this Google doc yet.
 
created the this Google doc yet.
It asked me to read it and say if I
 
It asked me to read it and say if I
liked what I saw or wanted to make
 
liked what I saw or wanted to make
tweaks.
 
tweaks.
And that's intentional in this case. You
 
And that's intentional in this case. You
don't have to do it this way. If you
 
don't have to do it this way. If you
tested this enough and you're like, you
 
tested this enough and you're like, you
know what, this is dialed in. and it's
 
know what, this is dialed in. and it's
like gosh 99 times out of 100 it stops
 
like gosh 99 times out of 100 it stops
and asks me if I'd like to make tweaks
 
and asks me if I'd like to make tweaks
before I create the Google doc and I say
 
before I create the Google doc and I say
no because it's just it's right there
 
no because it's just it's right there
it's spoton you can take that step out
 
it's spoton you can take that step out
and it will automatically create the doc
 
and it will automatically create the doc
in this case it's good you know
 
in this case it's good you know
and now it will create the Google doc
 
and now it will create the Google doc
and so this this one I use regularly
 
and so this this one I use regularly
when we're hiring folks into the people
 
when we're hiring folks into the people
team at zapier wow that is so Kelly this
 
team at zapier wow that is so Kelly this
This is what I've been say is like I saw
 
This is what I've been say is like I saw
this like a couple weeks ago of people
 
this like a couple weeks ago of people
starting to like really like I mean this
 
starting to like really like I mean this
stuff I would show candidly I'm going to
 
stuff I would show candidly I'm going to
be very honest I would show up
 
be very honest I would show up
unprepared to 95% of the interviews
 
unprepared to 95% of the interviews
where I was the final interviewer for
 
where I was the final interviewer for
you know like call it like XYZ
 
you know like call it like XYZ
crossunctional team or even like junior
 
crossunctional team or even like junior
candidates on my team because I'm just
 
candidates on my team because I'm just
like all right I trust these people like
 
like all right I trust these people like
I'm going to show up and make sure
 
I'm going to show up and make sure
they're not they're not like a lunatic
 
they're not they're not like a lunatic
but that's like such a waste of my time.
 
but that's like such a waste of my time.
It's a waste of the candidates's time.
 
It's a waste of the candidates's time.
You know, I'd say 97 out of a 100 times
 
You know, I'd say 97 out of a 100 times
the candidates's getting green lit from
 
the candidates's getting green lit from
me. And this is a way to actually add
 
me. And this is a way to actually add
value into that process without me being
 
value into that process without me being
the person who's like, "Oh my god, I
 
the person who's like, "Oh my god, I
don't have enough time in the day to
 
don't have enough time in the day to
prepare for these, right?" Well,
 
prepare for these, right?" Well,
technically, you could also use it for
 
technically, you could also use it for
any interview, not just a a bar raiser
 
any interview, not just a a bar raiser
interview, you know? So, I guess Yeah.
 
interview, you know? So, I guess Yeah.
What's what's the difference, Brandon,
 
What's what's the difference, Brandon,
if you kind of so, you know, selected
 
if you kind of so, you know, selected
bar raiser versus just general? I mean,
 
bar raiser versus just general? I mean,
it's a good it's a good question. You
 
it's a good it's a good question. You
know, the type of bar raiser that we do
 
know, the type of bar raiser that we do
at Zapier is meant to be dynamic in the
 
at Zapier is meant to be dynamic in the
sense that it's meant to like polish our
 
sense that it's meant to like polish our
understanding of a candidate. And so,
 
understanding of a candidate. And so,
the types of gaps or places where we
 
the types of gaps or places where we
want to go deeper are going to vary from
 
want to go deeper are going to vary from
finalist to finalist. The rubric that
 
finalist to finalist. The rubric that
we're using to assess the candidates for
 
we're using to assess the candidates for
the job are exactly the same, but the
 
the job are exactly the same, but the
places where we end up with like
 
places where we end up with like
slightly thinner evidence or places
 
slightly thinner evidence or places
where we're still curious, that's going
 
where we're still curious, that's going
to vary. And therefore, the bar raiser
 
to vary. And therefore, the bar raiser
interview guide is also going to vary.
 
interview guide is also going to vary.
Now, at
 
Now, at
every other stage in the interview cycle
 
every other stage in the interview cycle
in our hiring practice, those interview
 
in our hiring practice, those interview
guides are on the rails. It's the same
 
guides are on the rails. It's the same
questions every single time. And the bar
 
questions every single time. And the bar
raiser one is the one that's dynamic
 
raiser one is the one that's dynamic
based on, you know, where we ended up
 
based on, you know, where we ended up
with more or less evidence and where we
 
with more or less evidence and where we
want to close gaps. Sick. All right,
 
want to close gaps. Sick. All right,
Brandon, what else you got for us? All
 
Brandon, what else you got for us? All
right. Well, now let's let's talk about
 
right. Well, now let's let's talk about
another, you know, I think something all
 
another, you know, I think something all
of us can relate with, which is, you
 
of us can relate with, which is, you
know, we're writing whatever our
 
know, we're writing whatever our
company's version of our, you know,
 
company's version of our, you know,
performance review is. And usually that
 
performance review is. And usually that
includes a self-reflection, right? So,
 
includes a self-reflection, right? So,
performance review of ourselves. And I,
 
you know, I I don't really I'm actually
 
you know, I I don't really I'm actually
about to do it next week for myself and
 
about to do it next week for myself and
I will tell you like I got to go back
 
I will tell you like I got to go back
into the vault to like remember all the
 
into the vault to like remember all the
you know what did I what did I do? What
 
you know what did I what did I do? What
did I learn? Accomplishments and so on.
 
did I learn? Accomplishments and so on.
And this is another place where like
 
And this is another place where like
humans are messy and imperfect and you
 
humans are messy and imperfect and you
know like we're all you know apt to have
 
know like we're all you know apt to have
you know recency bias, forgetfulness,
 
you know recency bias, forgetfulness,
just anchor on things that aren't
 
just anchor on things that aren't
necessarily the things that matter the
 
necessarily the things that matter the
most. And so one of the things we're
 
most. And so one of the things we're
curious about is like how can we help
 
curious about is like how can we help
easy button and eventually automate
 
easy button and eventually automate
evidence collection for coaching
 
evidence collection for coaching
performance reviews things of that
 
performance reviews things of that
nature. And what I'm about to show is
 
nature. And what I'm about to show is
not a full answer to that question, but
 
not a full answer to that question, but
it's an interesting prototype of what's
 
it's an interesting prototype of what's
possible.
 
possible.
So, in this one, we're also in Zap Your
 
So, in this one, we're also in Zap Your
agents here. And what this one does is
 
agents here. And what this one does is
it's it's for me. What I'm trying to
 
it's it's for me. What I'm trying to
solve for is like when I get a piece of
 
solve for is like when I get a piece of
feedback or when something good happens
 
feedback or when something good happens
that I've contributed to, I want a
 
that I've contributed to, I want a
running documentation of all of that so
 
running documentation of all of that so
that I don't have the blank page
 
that I don't have the blank page
problem. when it comes time to write my
 
problem. when it comes time to write my
whatever it might be, my self-evaluation
 
whatever it might be, my self-evaluation
for a performance cycle, my case for
 
for a performance cycle, my case for
promotion,
 
promotion,
depending on your company's practices, a
 
depending on your company's practices, a
case for an offcycle pay raise, whatever
 
case for an offcycle pay raise, whatever
the case may be.
 
the case may be.
What the agent does is I have it I have
 
What the agent does is I have it I have
it set up that now caveat, Zapier does
 
it set up that now caveat, Zapier does
almost all of its communication in
 
almost all of its communication in
Slack. Like a lot of this evidence would
 
Slack. Like a lot of this evidence would
be coming up in Slack threads,
 
be coming up in Slack threads,
conversation feedback and so on, but in
 
conversation feedback and so on, but in
Slack. So what this says is, hey, when I
 
Slack. So what this says is, hey, when I
see something I want to document for
 
see something I want to document for
future reference, I don't want to copy
 
future reference, I don't want to copy
and paste into a doc. Some of these
 
and paste into a doc. Some of these
threads are super long, what I want to
 
threads are super long, what I want to
do, I want to use a very specific
 
do, I want to use a very specific
reaction in Slack. And that's what this
 
reaction in Slack. And that's what this
trigger is. So when Brandon Slack
 
trigger is. So when Brandon Slack
account adds the blob notes reaction to
 
account adds the blob notes reaction to
anything in Slack, it's it's an emoji.
 
anything in Slack, it's it's an emoji.
It's an emoji. And I'll show it to you
 
It's an emoji. And I'll show it to you
in a minute. And when I tag anything in
 
in a minute. And when I tag anything in
Slack with this emoji, then do what's in
 
Slack with this emoji, then do what's in
the instructions, right? So, it's like
 
the instructions, right? So, it's like
classic prompting like roll
 
classic prompting like roll
trigger. So, again, there's the trigger
 
trigger. So, again, there's the trigger
again when I, you know, react to a
 
again when I, you know, react to a
thread, analyze the conversation,
 
thread, analyze the conversation,
create a summary, focus on what it's
 
create a summary, focus on what it's
about, how it relates to my work or
 
about, how it relates to my work or
performance, and then it includes an
 
performance, and then it includes an
example of what I'm looking for.
 
example of what I'm looking for.
I actually added this one last week
 
I actually added this one last week
because it was originally in there. This
 
because it was originally in there. This
last instruction is like include a link
 
last instruction is like include a link
back to the Slack comment. So, I have it
 
back to the Slack comment. So, I have it
for reference as I'm clicking through if
 
for reference as I'm clicking through if
I want like more of the original
 
I want like more of the original
material. So, it's just this is amazing,
 
material. So, it's just this is amazing,
right? Like you had a single sentence to
 
right? Like you had a single sentence to
this prompt and it's exactly the way you
 
this prompt and it's exactly the way you
want it. Which, by the way, which by the
 
want it. Which, by the way, which by the
way, you didn't have when you first
 
way, you didn't have when you first
built this. That's what I like the thing
 
built this. That's what I like the thing
I got hung up on a couple weeks ago was
 
I got hung up on a couple weeks ago was
letting perfect be the enemy of good and
 
letting perfect be the enemy of good and
just like get going and then when you
 
just like get going and then when you
realize oh it's actually not perfect
 
realize oh it's actually not perfect
here go make the edit which takes 30
 
here go make the edit which takes 30
seconds right that's exactly it and in
 
seconds right that's exactly it and in
fact that's exactly what I did and it
 
fact that's exactly what I did and it
really did take literally 30 seconds to
 
really did take literally 30 seconds to
make this update and then I tested it
 
make this update and then I tested it
right and that's one of the things of
 
right and that's one of the things of
course you know we're finding so helpful
 
course you know we're finding so helpful
is like you kind of treat an agent like
 
is like you kind of treat an agent like
you would an employee right I'm giving
 
you would an employee right I'm giving
this a job to do I think I'm being clear
 
this a job to do I think I'm being clear
in my instructions. It's time to test.
 
in my instructions. It's time to test.
But the speed of like build, test,
 
But the speed of like build, test,
learn, and improve is so fast. And
 
learn, and improve is so fast. And
again, not only is it fast, but you
 
again, not only is it fast, but you
know, it doesn't require like special
 
know, it doesn't require like special
skills or at least harder to develop
 
skills or at least harder to develop
skills. There's definitely some skilling
 
skills. There's definitely some skilling
involved in this, but wow is it
 
involved in this, but wow is it
relatively straightforward to pick up
 
relatively straightforward to pick up
compared to learning how to code.
 
compared to learning how to code.
So, I said I would show what this looks
 
So, I said I would show what this looks
like in Slack and then we'll go to the
 
like in Slack and then we'll go to the
finished product. So let me do a little
 
finished product. So let me do a little
switcheroo here. The other thing while
 
switcheroo here. The other thing while
you're doing the switcheroo is making me
 
you're doing the switcheroo is making me
think like so this is you know this is
 
think like so this is you know this is
today's iteration. the future iteration,
 
today's iteration. the future iteration,
right, is probably gonna be living in
 
right, is probably gonna be living in
the background of Slack to where you're
 
the background of Slack to where you're
not even gonna have to hit this emoji
 
not even gonna have to hit this emoji
you're about to show us, right? And it's
 
you're about to show us, right? And it's
going to just kind of be idling back
 
going to just kind of be idling back
there. And then you're going to send it
 
there. And then you're going to send it
prompts things like, "Hey, what are my
 
prompts things like, "Hey, what are my
blind spots, right? And how I
 
blind spots, right? And how I
communicate with the rest of the team or
 
communicate with the rest of the team or
like, you know, what do you think I'm
 
like, you know, what do you think I'm
doing really well at or what do you
 
doing really well at or what do you
think I can be better at?" And it's just
 
think I can be better at?" And it's just
reading all of Slack all the time and
 
reading all of Slack all the time and
essentially like filling in your gaps,
 
essentially like filling in your gaps,
being your ondemand coach. You've got
 
being your ondemand coach. You've got
it. Yeah, I think that's right. And in
 
it. Yeah, I think that's right. And in
doing so, by the way, like it that would
 
doing so, by the way, like it that would
be like I think the highest level like
 
be like I think the highest level like
agentic workflow is it's doing work on
 
agentic workflow is it's doing work on
your behalf with little to no humanled
 
your behalf with little to no humanled
triggering. Well, then also I had is is
 
triggering. Well, then also I had is is
a person, right? Imagine, you know, no
 
a person, right? Imagine, you know, no
one, you're you're pulling up me and I'm
 
one, you're you're pulling up me and I'm
an AI agent and I'm talking just like
 
an AI agent and I'm talking just like
this and I'm not only doing all that,
 
this and I'm not only doing all that,
but now I'm talking through the feedback
 
but now I'm talking through the feedback
with you. You're almost like mocking
 
with you. You're almost like mocking
through a conversation or going into
 
through a conversation or going into
more detail about the feedback. That's
 
more detail about the feedback. That's
right. We're going to be testing
 
right. We're going to be testing
something internally in the second half
 
something internally in the second half
of this year along these lines where
 
of this year along these lines where
it's kind of like, you know, coaching in
 
it's kind of like, you know, coaching in
the flow of work would be a good way to
 
the flow of work would be a good way to
describe it where it notices that
 
describe it where it notices that
something's been discussed or
 
something's been discussed or
something's going on in a meeting and it
 
something's going on in a meeting and it
will basically say, "Hey, sounds like
 
will basically say, "Hey, sounds like
XYZ came up in that meeting. If you're
 
XYZ came up in that meeting. If you're
looking for example for a way to like
 
looking for example for a way to like
give some feedback about that, like do
 
give some feedback about that, like do
you want to talk about that? Do you want
 
you want to talk about that? Do you want
to roleplay it?" Or, "Hey, like you
 
to roleplay it?" Or, "Hey, like you
know, looks like you were facilitating
 
know, looks like you were facilitating
that meeting. I noticed that it didn't
 
that meeting. I noticed that it didn't
sound like the next steps were super
 
sound like the next steps were super
clear. Here's what I mean by that. Like
 
clear. Here's what I mean by that. Like
here's what I thought I heard. Like is
 
here's what I thought I heard. Like is
that right? Like if if you think that's
 
that right? Like if if you think that's
if you think there's something to that,
 
if you think there's something to that,
you may want to, you know, follow up
 
you may want to, you know, follow up
with the group, make sure those next
 
with the group, make sure those next
steps are clear. Wow. I mean, so all
 
steps are clear. Wow. I mean, so all
three of us, by the way, do coaching.
 
three of us, by the way, do coaching.
And you know, you can imagine, right, if
 
And you know, you can imagine, right, if
you have like all of the NDAs and like
 
you have like all of the NDAs and like
legal BS figured out, but you can
 
legal BS figured out, but you can
actually imagine like coaching clients
 
actually imagine like coaching clients
opting in for these sorts of things and
 
opting in for these sorts of things and
you're getting actually data from like
 
you're getting actually data from like
what's actually happening versus what
 
what's actually happening versus what
the coaching client is telling you and
 
the coaching client is telling you and
to help improve. So, it's I think a lot
 
to help improve. So, it's I think a lot
of times people get really worried about
 
of times people get really worried about
oh my god like the agents are taking
 
oh my god like the agents are taking
over versus really like you know it's
 
over versus really like you know it's
like steroids and like really turning
 
like steroids and like really turning
this coach or whoever it is like using
 
this coach or whoever it is like using
the data into more of somebody who can
 
the data into more of somebody who can
actually help you and help your
 
actually help you and help your
performance. Yeah. I talked to a founder
 
performance. Yeah. I talked to a founder
this morning who's I mean I feel like
 
this morning who's I mean I feel like
these are you know this is incredible.
 
these are you know this is incredible.
Xavier is incredible. I talked to a
 
Xavier is incredible. I talked to a
founder this morning who's trying to
 
founder this morning who's trying to
create that and like a coach in the
 
create that and like a coach in the
workflow like a person and I said you
 
workflow like a person and I said you
know the the day that someone figures
 
know the the day that someone figures
out how to how to create 10 of me in an
 
out how to how to create 10 of me in an
organization that can talk like this to
 
organization that can talk like this to
 
the company on demand and their
 
the company on demand and their
workflow. It's coming. It's it's super
 
workflow. It's coming. It's it's super
interesting. And so you know take a look
 
interesting. And so you know take a look
at the at the screen right here. So this
 
at the at the screen right here. So this
is this is Slack at Zapier. This is our
 
is this is Slack at Zapier. This is our
general channel is our all company
 
general channel is our all company
channel and you'll see Wade does a what
 
channel and you'll see Wade does a what
he calls his Friday five. It's like five
 
he calls his Friday five. It's like five
really interesting things going on
 
really interesting things going on
around the company and he had a sixth
 
around the company and he had a sixth
one this past week and because we did a
 
one this past week and because we did a
big launch moment for what we're calling
 
big launch moment for what we're calling
HR by Zapier. you're really starting to
 
HR by Zapier. you're really starting to
package up some of the use cases that
 
package up some of the use cases that
we're finding helpful inside our own
 
we're finding helpful inside our own
company in making it easier for other
 
company in making it easier for other
people or HR teams to uh put those to
 
people or HR teams to uh put those to
work in their organizations. And so it
 
work in their organizations. And so it
was just a shout from Wade to the team
 
was just a shout from Wade to the team
and I. And if you'll notice right down
 
and I. And if you'll notice right down
here, well, there's that reaction blob
 
here, well, there's that reaction blob
notes. That's the trigger when I use
 
notes. That's the trigger when I use
that emoji, not when someone else uses
 
that emoji, not when someone else uses
it. When I use it, that's the trigger
 
it. When I use it, that's the trigger
for the agent. And with that in mind,
 
for the agent. And with that in mind,
I'll show you what happens.
 
I'll show you what happens.
Here we go.
 
So when that happens,
 
So when that happens,
I have a Google running Google doc
 
I have a Google running Google doc
and it will drop in the summary. Now I
 
and it will drop in the summary. Now I
did this yesterday because it takes for
 
did this yesterday because it takes for
it to run the loop. It takes like 15
 
it to run the loop. It takes like 15
minutes or so to pick up on it because I
 
minutes or so to pick up on it because I
don't have it running. I have it running
 
don't have it running. I have it running
like periodically to save some compute.
 
like periodically to save some compute.
But you can see right here when I
 
But you can see right here when I
triggered it yesterday, got a little
 
triggered it yesterday, got a little
summary of what it was about,
 
summary of what it was about,
little context on on the overall kind of
 
little context on on the overall kind of
wrapper, and then a link directly back
 
wrapper, and then a link directly back
to the message that the evidence is
 
to the message that the evidence is
pulled from. And you can imagine using
 
pulled from. And you can imagine using
this throughout, you know, whether you
 
this throughout, you know, whether you
do semiannual reviews or annual reviews,
 
do semiannual reviews or annual reviews,
just tagging stuff up throughout an
 
just tagging stuff up throughout an
extended period of time. And then when
 
extended period of time. And then when
it's time to sit down and make that
 
it's time to sit down and make that
promotion case or write your
 
promotion case or write your
self-reflection for your performance
 
self-reflection for your performance
review, like you've got what is
 
review, like you've got what is
ultimately the thing that takes the most
 
ultimately the thing that takes the most
time if you want to do a really good
 
time if you want to do a really good
review, which is having a, you know,
 
review, which is having a, you know,
fairly comprehensive set of evidence to
 
fairly comprehensive set of evidence to
build on. Yeah. I mean, my advice to
 
build on. Yeah. I mean, my advice to
people and what I tried to do was I let
 
people and what I tried to do was I let
I literally kept a running note, right?
 
I literally kept a running note, right?
And I would try and add to that thing
 
And I would try and add to that thing
once a week, once every couple weeks,
 
once a week, once every couple weeks,
but you know, turns out life happens.
 
but you know, turns out life happens.
you get busy, you forget, right? You
 
you get busy, you forget, right? You
have all the human problems and you just
 
have all the human problems and you just
like don't do it. Or like maybe you're
 
like don't do it. Or like maybe you're
running from meeting to meeting and just
 
running from meeting to meeting and just
clicking a little emoji is a perfect
 
clicking a little emoji is a perfect
example of like so much faster, so much
 
example of like so much faster, so much
easier to be able to capture what you
 
easier to be able to capture what you
need to capture. 100%.
 
need to capture. 100%.
Sick. Let me make one point about some
 
Sick. Let me make one point about some
of these workflows that y'all were
 
of these workflows that y'all were
hitting on earlier indirectly, which is
 
hitting on earlier indirectly, which is
about employee choice. And you take some
 
about employee choice. And you take some
of these workflows, right, like this
 
of these workflows, right, like this
one. And there's a big difference
 
one. And there's a big difference
between, you know, our company telling
 
between, you know, our company telling
everyone you got to use it
 
everyone you got to use it
and us like treating this more like a
 
and us like treating this more like a
market, right? which is if my team makes
 
market, right? which is if my team makes
a credible case for how this is going to
 
a credible case for how this is going to
help our people be great, be recognized,
 
help our people be great, be recognized,
you know, have a performance review that
 
you know, have a performance review that
feels like more comprehensive, more
 
feels like more comprehensive, more
fair, higher decision quality, then
 
fair, higher decision quality, then
folks are going to pull this off the
 
folks are going to pull this off the
shelf and use it.
 
shelf and use it.
And that's generally speaking like the
 
And that's generally speaking like the
paradigm that we're anchoring on. supply
 
paradigm that we're anchoring on. supply
and demand. Make it available, market it
 
and demand. Make it available, market it
effectively. If it's genuinely useful,
 
effectively. If it's genuinely useful,
folks will use it. If it's not genuinely
 
folks will use it. If it's not genuinely
useful or if there's something about it
 
useful or if there's something about it
that does not inspire trust or if it's
 
that does not inspire trust or if it's
just too hard to use, well, that's
 
just too hard to use, well, that's
feedback, right? Let's go make it better
 
feedback, right? Let's go make it better
rather than telling folks they have to
 
rather than telling folks they have to
use it. Yeah, the effective marketing
 
use it. Yeah, the effective marketing
piece is actually something I hadn't
 
piece is actually something I hadn't
thought about. And you know, said a
 
thought about. And you know, said a
little bit differently, Brandon, a lot
 
little bit differently, Brandon, a lot
of CEOs are saying you must use AI at
 
of CEOs are saying you must use AI at
this company in some way, shape, or
 
this company in some way, shape, or
form. And I think underneath the thing
 
form. And I think underneath the thing
is, uh-oh, like everyone else is sending
 
is, uh-oh, like everyone else is sending
this message. I better send this message
 
this message. I better send this message
too, and people better be using it and
 
too, and people better be using it and
teaching me how to use it. And that's of
 
teaching me how to use it. And that's of
course like everybody wants that, but
 
course like everybody wants that, but
what you guys are doing is saying like,
 
what you guys are doing is saying like,
"No, no, no. leadership like needs to be
 
"No, no, no. leadership like needs to be
native in this and we need to do a great
 
native in this and we need to do a great
job of teaching everybody how valuable
 
job of teaching everybody how valuable
it is and why it's so dope so that it's
 
it is and why it's so dope so that it's
so obvious for them that they should be
 
so obvious for them that they should be
using. I think that's the higher bar. I
 
using. I think that's the higher bar. I
think it's the right one. Yeah, I agree.
 
think it's the right one. Yeah, I agree.
It's the more sustainable one and the
 
It's the more sustainable one and the
more authentic one. And it's kind of
 
more authentic one. And it's kind of
like with anything return to office
 
like with anything return to office
programs like
 
programs like
you know. Yeah. Right. Right. Huh.
 
you know. Yeah. Right. Right. Huh.
Harder to do. Yeah. Yeah, it takes well
 
Harder to do. Yeah. Yeah, it takes well
it takes, you know, it actually takes
 
it takes, you know, it actually takes
leadership doing real work and and this
 
leadership doing real work and and this
is like this is the this is where we are
 
is like this is the this is where we are
in this cycle is like there are very few
 
in this cycle is like there are very few
companies still that have real life use
 
companies still that have real life use
cases like Brandon is showing us today.
 
cases like Brandon is showing us today.
Yeah, this is this is so helpful. Well,
 
Yeah, this is this is so helpful. Well,
I mean for for one of the biggest things
 
I mean for for one of the biggest things
for me maybe for the audience is is just
 
for me maybe for the audience is is just
to demystify how
 
to demystify how
simple these use cases actually are
 
simple these use cases actually are
because again you hear the big cloud of
 
because again you hear the big cloud of
use AI and HR and everyone gets you know
 
use AI and HR and everyone gets you know
deer in headlights Google paralyzed and
 
deer in headlights Google paralyzed and
I understand why but again like we
 
I understand why but again like we
started the conversation breaking it
 
started the conversation breaking it
down and just unpacking exactly what you
 
down and just unpacking exactly what you
mean so we can touch it and feel it.
 
mean so we can touch it and feel it.
It's like, oh my gosh, not only is this
 
It's like, oh my gosh, not only is this
demystifying it, but I want to actually
 
demystifying it, but I want to actually
go do this because I understand. And how
 
go do this because I understand. And how
long do these take to set up, Brandon?
 
long do these take to set up, Brandon?
You know, I think the first like to
 
You know, I think the first like to
here, let's come back
 
here, let's come back
to set this up. 10 minutes to to test
 
to set this up. 10 minutes to to test
and tune it, you know, another another
 
and tune it, you know, another another
hour maybe if you if you really want to,
 
hour maybe if you if you really want to,
which I recommend, by the way. It's
 
which I recommend, by the way. It's
worth it to like really make sure it's
 
worth it to like really make sure it's
delivering, you know, what you're
 
delivering, you know, what you're
looking for. Yeah, another another hour.
 
looking for. Yeah, another another hour.
I know folks that can do it faster than
 
I know folks that can do it faster than
I can, but that's my that's my timing.
 
I can, but that's my that's my timing.
That's crazy. How many boomerangs did
 
That's crazy. How many boomerangs did
you get? Maybe like those alumni emails
 
you get? Maybe like those alumni emails
alone, right? It took you 10 minutes.
 
alone, right? It took you 10 minutes.
It's automated. You get one
 
It's automated. You get one
transformational hire back because of
 
transformational hire back because of
that over two years. I mean, I can't
 
that over two years. I mean, I can't
even I can quantify it. That's right.
 
even I can quantify it. That's right.
Oh, it's boomerangs. It's also, you
 
Oh, it's boomerangs. It's also, you
know, a lot of alums go work at partners
 
know, a lot of alums go work at partners
and customers of Zapier. And so, it's
 
and customers of Zapier. And so, it's
like we want folks to we want You're
 
like we want folks to we want You're
right. just interpersonally, but also
 
right. just interpersonally, but also
even if you're just even if you're just
 
even if you're just even if you're just
interested in maximizing the company's
 
interested in maximizing the company's
performance, you want to maintain a
 
performance, you want to maintain a
sense of belonging across the and you
 
sense of belonging across the and you
tinker as you go. Like that's the other
 
tinker as you go. Like that's the other
thing I want people to take away from
 
thing I want people to take away from
this is like yeah like test and stuff
 
this is like yeah like test and stuff
like that but like even if you can't
 
like that but like even if you can't
ensuring that there is a human in the
 
ensuring that there is a human in the
loop step which most of these you have
 
loop step which most of these you have
shown Brandon have a human in the loop
 
shown Brandon have a human in the loop
step right you could just do it live and
 
step right you could just do it live and
be like didn't love that one like let me
 
be like didn't love that one like let me
kick this off right now to get this off
 
kick this off right now to get this off
my you know my plate and then take five
 
my you know my plate and then take five
minutes to go update the prompt so then
 
minutes to go update the prompt so then
next time it doesn't make the same
 
next time it doesn't make the same
mistake. Exactly. You know, if you're
 
mistake. Exactly. You know, if you're
interested, I've got one more, please.
 
interested, I've got one more, please.
Okay, this next one is the most
 
Okay, this next one is the most
sophisticated build. It's not one that I
 
sophisticated build. It's not one that I
built and it's not one I could build
 
built and it's not one I could build
even today, but I'm sharing it to make a
 
even today, but I'm sharing it to make a
couple points. And the first point right
 
couple points. And the first point right
as I pivot over to it is that, you know,
 
as I pivot over to it is that, you know,
within a company, you don't need a 100%
 
within a company, you don't need a 100%
of folks to be, you know, deep deep like
 
of folks to be, you know, deep deep like
power builders of these use cases. So
 
power builders of these use cases. So
you need enough within each set of use
 
you need enough within each set of use
cases to be able to build and
 
cases to be able to build and
troubleshoot and maintain the workflows.
 
troubleshoot and maintain the workflows.
You know, the rest of us, you know, we
 
You know, the rest of us, you know, we
can pull that stuff off the shelf and
 
can pull that stuff off the shelf and
put it to work. And if you think about
 
put it to work. And if you think about
it that way, it should really increase
 
it that way, it should really increase
our all of our sense of possibility
 
our all of our sense of possibility
about what we can do. So here's a neat
 
about what we can do. So here's a neat
one. This is a AI one- on-one meeting
 
one. This is a AI one- on-one meeting
coach. This is for managers who in many
 
coach. This is for managers who in many
cases do one-on- ones or or coaching
 
cases do one-on- ones or or coaching
conversations with their direct reports.
 
conversations with their direct reports.
And what this one does is it listens in
 
And what this one does is it listens in
on those meetings with the consent of
 
on those meetings with the consent of
both people. It takes notes. It then
 
both people. It takes notes. It then
analyzes those notes for very specific
 
analyzes those notes for very specific
qualities that we believe make for a
 
qualities that we believe make for a
great one-on-one or proxy. And then it
 
great one-on-one or proxy. And then it
automatically provides coaching and
 
automatically provides coaching and
feedback to the manager after the
 
feedback to the manager after the
meeting.
 
meeting.
So, we talked about human in the loop
 
So, we talked about human in the loop
earlier. The only human in the loop
 
earlier. The only human in the loop
moment for this one once it's turned on
 
moment for this one once it's turned on
is hitting the record button. Everything
 
is hitting the record button. Everything
else is automated.
 
else is automated.
And you can see here a couple things.
 
And you can see here a couple things.
So, this is a workflow that blends
 
So, this is a workflow that blends
automation with AI. And if we're just to
 
automation with AI. And if we're just to
walk top to bottom here, it's it's, you
 
walk top to bottom here, it's it's, you
know, looking out for the recording once
 
know, looking out for the recording once
it's generated. uh it then importantly
 
it's generated. uh it then importantly
waits because Zoom or Microsoft Teams
 
waits because Zoom or Microsoft Teams
takes a minute to develop the transcript
 
takes a minute to develop the transcript
after the meeting. So, it's
 
after the meeting. So, it's
intentionally waiting for that
 
intentionally waiting for that
transcript to drop. It's then taking the
 
transcript to drop. It's then taking the
transcript and then there are a couple
 
transcript and then there are a couple
code steps and I give credit to one of
 
code steps and I give credit to one of
our learning designers here on the
 
our learning designers here on the
people team, Emily Maybe. She and a
 
people team, Emily Maybe. She and a
couple teammates put this one together.
 
couple teammates put this one together.
But again, Emily and our team, we don't
 
But again, Emily and our team, we don't
have developers on our team, but Emily
 
have developers on our team, but Emily
was able to write Zapier code steps. So
 
was able to write Zapier code steps. So
in other words, just write code to do
 
in other words, just write code to do
very specific things that aren't
 
very specific things that aren't
hardcoded into our automation schema to
 
hardcoded into our automation schema to
do some really interesting things around
 
do some really interesting things around
structuring the transcript and
 
structuring the transcript and
reorganizing it, getting clarity on
 
reorganizing it, getting clarity on
who's the manager and who's the direct
 
who's the manager and who's the direct
report. Like it's just pretty incredible
 
report. Like it's just pretty incredible
what she calculating the the talk to
 
what she calculating the the talk to
listen ratio is really interesting. Oh
 
listen ratio is really interesting. Oh
yeah. Yeah, I mean this is and that's
 
yeah. Yeah, I mean this is and that's
custom like you know like Emily made
 
custom like you know like Emily made
that using code by Zapier with the
 
that using code by Zapier with the
assist of an LLM. The other like icing
 
assist of an LLM. The other like icing
on the cake here is that as you do more
 
on the cake here is that as you do more
and more of these one-on- ones and
 
and more of these one-on- ones and
generate more and more of this feedback
 
generate more and more of this feedback
it actually databases it and then
 
it actually databases it and then
provides thematic feedback about hey
 
provides thematic feedback about hey
like over the last 90 days in general
 
like over the last 90 days in general
here are some themes I'm seeing so you
 
here are some themes I'm seeing so you
know here's something to keep doing
 
know here's something to keep doing
here's something to start doing or do
 
here's something to start doing or do
something different. Wow. To give you an
 
something different. Wow. To give you an
example of the output, I had a
 
example of the output, I had a
one-on-one recently and call it 45
 
one-on-one recently and call it 45
minutes after the meeting once the
 
minutes after the meeting once the
transcript was created and the feedback
 
transcript was created and the feedback
was synthesized. I get this in Slack and
 
was synthesized. I get this in Slack and
you can see here there's like kind of oh
 
you can see here there's like kind of oh
my god,
 
my god,
you know overall strengths do betters
 
you know overall strengths do betters
and then the feedback trend isn't super
 
and then the feedback trend isn't super
useful in this example because I don't
 
useful in this example because I don't
have a ton of data in the table that's
 
have a ton of data in the table that's
aggregating but you can imagine if you'd
 
aggregating but you can imagine if you'd
done like 20 30 50 100 meetings of this
 
done like 20 30 50 100 meetings of this
type you know over some period of time
 
type you know over some period of time
you know you would get genuinely useful
 
you know you would get genuinely useful
like thematic feedback. Yeah. Yeah. And
 
like thematic feedback. Yeah. Yeah. And
you could emoji that or whatever and put
 
you could emoji that or whatever and put
it in your notes that you were talking
 
it in your notes that you were talking
about earlier. Yeah. This one though,
 
about earlier. Yeah. This one though,
Kelly, is like this is scaling HRBPS,
 
Kelly, is like this is scaling HRBPS,
right? This is like, hey, we managers
 
right? This is like, hey, we managers
suck. Every company has a problem with
 
suck. Every company has a problem with
shitty managers, right? It's the hardest
 
shitty managers, right? It's the hardest
thing because you're not in that room to
 
thing because you're not in that room to
give them feedback. What Brandon and his
 
give them feedback. What Brandon and his
team are doing here is they're
 
team are doing here is they're
essentially saying, "Well, as long as
 
essentially saying, "Well, as long as
you press record," which again, you
 
you press record," which again, you
know, six months from now, that's going
 
know, six months from now, that's going
to be the default, right? And that's
 
to be the default, right? And that's
they're not going to even have an
 
they're not going to even have an
option. It's going to be how we work.
 
option. It's going to be how we work.
What's going to end up happening here is
 
What's going to end up happening here is
they're going to get feedback from AI
 
they're going to get feedback from AI
that is that has the tinkering on the
 
that is that has the tinkering on the
back end from us to tell managers
 
back end from us to tell managers
exactly what we expect and what they did
 
exactly what we expect and what they did
well and where they could grow and then
 
well and where they could grow and then
we're going to have it on our back end
 
we're going to have it on our back end
as well to be able to manage all of the
 
as well to be able to manage all of the
things that we can't see. That is
 
things that we can't see. That is
incredible. Well, we said earlier
 
incredible. Well, we said earlier
meeting them in the meeting them in the
 
meeting them in the meeting them in the
workflow of their day in the flow of
 
workflow of their day in the flow of
work. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Scaling us and
 
work. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Scaling us and
then right I'm the HRBP. You give me a
 
then right I'm the HRBP. You give me a
hundred of these. I now use this as an
 
hundred of these. I now use this as an
aggregate dashboard instead of running.
 
aggregate dashboard instead of running.
Well, actually instead even even Yeah.
 
Well, actually instead even even Yeah.
So to your point, right? Right, Kelly.
 
So to your point, right? Right, Kelly.
So then the next thing you're going to
 
So then the next thing you're going to
do is you're going to say like, okay,
 
do is you're going to say like, okay,
here's all the managers and all the
 
here's all the managers and all the
feedback. Stack rank my best managers.
 
feedback. Stack rank my best managers.
Like stack rank managers one to 100.
 
Like stack rank managers one to 100.
Brandon, this is so cool. Well, you have
 
Brandon, this is so cool. Well, you have
so many choices to make around this,
 
so many choices to make around this,
too, because you know, you you get to
 
too, because you know, you you get to
choose, you know, is this one of those
 
choose, you know, is this one of those
kind of on demand, off-the-shelf type of
 
kind of on demand, off-the-shelf type of
workflows that folks can choose if they
 
workflows that folks can choose if they
want to sharpen up their one-on- ones as
 
want to sharpen up their one-on- ones as
a manager? Is it a is it a required
 
a manager? Is it a is it a required
workflow? If it's a required workflow,
 
workflow? If it's a required workflow,
you have yet another choice to make.
 
you have yet another choice to make.
Actually either way you have an other
 
Actually either way you have an other
choice to make around like are you
 
choice to make around like are you
collecting the metadata to in fact you
 
collecting the metadata to in fact you
know understand who your most or least
 
know understand who your most or least
skillful managers are at least as it
 
skillful managers are at least as it
relates to doing one-on ones. How does
 
relates to doing one-on ones. How does
that influence trust in the workflow?
 
that influence trust in the workflow?
How does that influence whether folks
 
How does that influence whether folks
actually use it? Like a lot of
 
actually use it? Like a lot of
interesting things there. Our current
 
interesting things there. Our current
theory of action for this one is we have
 
theory of action for this one is we have
kind of a golden path for this so folks
 
kind of a golden path for this so folks
don't have to redo all of this goodness
 
don't have to redo all of this goodness
that Emily and colleagues put together.
 
that Emily and colleagues put together.
No one has to make this up again. It's a
 
No one has to make this up again. It's a
template, right? You copy it, you author
 
template, right? You copy it, you author
your own stuff in and you're good to go.
 
your own stuff in and you're good to go.
But it's still on demand. So we don't
 
But it's still on demand. So we don't
require that folks use it right now. We
 
require that folks use it right now. We
are making a case again use actually
 
are making a case again use actually
using like user stories, right? This is
 
using like user stories, right? This is
just like marketing, right? It's just
 
just like marketing, right? It's just
inside your company like anecdotes like
 
inside your company like anecdotes like
I'm using this, here's how it's
 
I'm using this, here's how it's
sharpening me like etc. And importantly,
 
sharpening me like etc. And importantly,
we're not currently doing anything with
 
we're not currently doing anything with
the data like we're not collecting it in
 
the data like we're not collecting it in
some extra place. Different ways to
 
some extra place. Different ways to
approach it all with their merits and
 
approach it all with their merits and
challenges. One thing I highly recommend
 
challenges. One thing I highly recommend
no matter which way organizations go on
 
no matter which way organizations go on
a question like this is to be very clear
 
a question like this is to be very clear
and transparent with your team about
 
and transparent with your team about
things like this. What data is being
 
things like this. What data is being
collected? Where is it being stored? Who
 
collected? Where is it being stored? Who
is it for? Who else gets to see it? And
 
is it for? Who else gets to see it? And
if other people other than just me are
 
if other people other than just me are
going to see this information, what will
 
going to see this information, what will
it be and not be used for? And again,
 
it be and not be used for? And again,
like you can have lots of interesting
 
like you can have lots of interesting
conversations around like the right
 
conversations around like the right
answers to those questions for a
 
answers to those questions for a
specific use case and a specific
 
specific use case and a specific
organization, but the most important
 
organization, but the most important
takeaway is be clear and be transparent
 
takeaway is be clear and be transparent
because that's the type of thing that
 
because that's the type of thing that
builds trust and inspires folks to try
 
builds trust and inspires folks to try
more of this stuff out over time. Wow.
 
more of this stuff out over time. Wow.
Yeah. It reminds me of, you know, when I
 
Yeah. It reminds me of, you know, when I
was in high school, we would have
 
was in high school, we would have
optional practices on sat Saturday and
 
optional practices on sat Saturday and
we we described those practices as
 
we we described those practices as
mandoptional because like ultimately
 
mandoptional because like ultimately
like they were kind of mandatory and if
 
like they were kind of mandatory and if
people aren't using it like that's kind
 
people aren't using it like that's kind
of a signal itself, but what you guys
 
of a signal itself, but what you guys
are doing such a good job of is just
 
are doing such a good job of is just
saying like this is the like listen to
 
saying like this is the like listen to
these people talk, right? And if you
 
these people talk, right? And if you
don't use it after listening to these
 
don't use it after listening to these
people and it's been a couple months,
 
people and it's been a couple months,
like you know, we'll have a conversation
 
like you know, we'll have a conversation
then. But like I love the idea of
 
then. But like I love the idea of
encouraging people to use the stuff
 
encouraging people to use the stuff
that's just off the shelf that you guys
 
that's just off the shelf that you guys
are doing that the people team is adding
 
are doing that the people team is adding
value to the organization. And it's like
 
value to the organization. And it's like
this is the whole idea is like it's
 
this is the whole idea is like it's
turning us all into the the Iron Man
 
turning us all into the the Iron Man
suit versus the AI overlords are doing
 
suit versus the AI overlords are doing
the job.
 
the job.
Wow. All right, Brandon, where can
 
Wow. All right, Brandon, where can
people find you? The best place. That's
 
people find you? The best place. That's
where we're going to keep sharing use
 
where we're going to keep sharing use
cases and things we're learning along
 
cases and things we're learning along
the way, including the hard stuff that
 
the way, including the hard stuff that
doesn't work. so you can see around
 
doesn't work. so you can see around
those corners. Okay. I didn't ask you
 
those corners. Okay. I didn't ask you
this before the show, but we are going
 
this before the show, but we are going
to require that you come on the show
 
to require that you come on the show
every couple of months and give us the
 
every couple of months and give us the
latest updates and the stuff that you're
 
latest updates and the stuff that you're
building so we can share with the rest
 
building so we can share with the rest
of the world. Oh, challenge accepted as
 
of the world. Oh, challenge accepted as
a good excuse to make sure we have a
 
a good excuse to make sure we have a
good point of view on the stuff we want
 
good point of view on the stuff we want
to showcase. Sick. Thanks so much,
