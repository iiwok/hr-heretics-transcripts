What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another HR heretics segment. Kelly, by
popular demand, we are going to do
another Dear Heretics. So, let's get
into this thing. All right. So, thanks
Nolan. I'm glad the conversation around
AI replacing entry-level jobs is finally
gaining traction as it's something I've
been thinking of and talking to folks
about for some time. There's two recent
headlines. So, one is from Axios and
they are calling it like a you know the
white collar blood bath specifically
talking about how early stage jobs are
going away. Then Josh Buren who is a
widely renowned HR author. He writes
about HR stuff. His article is no
entry-level jobs are not going away. So
opposing views here, Kelly. And so what
the author of this post says is, "While
I fully agree with Josh Buren that
companies need young talent for
generational transition, innovation and
long-term success, I've heard virtually
no example of companies actually putting
in the work now to redefine entry-level
roles or rebuild talent programs. I feel
like most companies today are still very
much in the mode of reducing staff and
being as lean as possible. But to me,
figuring out how to best leverage young
talent is as critical as ever as the AI
adoption innovation landscape is just
shifting so fast. So Josh says in his
article that almost every HR or HR
leader or head of recruiting told me
that they are rebuilding their
entry-level development programs for
young employees. So what are the
concrete examples? Would be awesome to
get people leaders to talk about this.
So Kelly, what's your take on this
thing? Have you seen people actually
thinking about like bringing in young
people and actually building programs
around this given the AI boom? I
personally have not seen a lot of like
we're the rubber hitting the road here
and you know it might be controversial
but I feel like that's been the whole
jam with this AI thing in general. It's
like woo AI but where is it happening?
like you know we just went to a event
last week and I know you had a dinner
and I talked to about 50 people in
person after doing a live podcast and I
couldn't get a lot of like give it to me
like let me touch it and feel what
you're doing around this and so again I
think we're kind of hovering over the
thing and there's a lot of talking about
it but I haven't seen a lot of it like
happening now let's pretend it is
happening right let's fast forward into
the future. I was talking to a a guy
last week about AI and replacing
entry-level jobs and all these things.
And I kind of had a point of like I
don't know if entry-level jobs are going
away. I just think the puck has moved as
far as what the entrylevel job now is.
What do you mean? Say more. Let's just
take I don't know. I don't even know the
example, but let's just pretend like
 
doing, you know, task A for an
entry-level job. AI now does that. I
don't need to do task A with a human
anymore. Yeah. But now the entry level
job is task B, one level up, because
it's just the waterline has now changed.
like the definition of what entry level
is now is changing because humans don't
have to do the old entry level. Does
that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I
hear you on that. I have a slightly more
nuanced take on this. So my take is is
like number one, talk to any chief
people officer at from growth to
enterprise company and they will all
tell you headcounts basically flat or
down from what it was in 2022. every
single one almost with uniform. It's
like we're flat or down. The other thing
you will hear from these people, there's
exceptions there, right? But like the
other thing you will hear from these
people is, okay, every time there's now
a backfill, we used to just
automatically approve it. So, you know,
Jane submits her resignation, finance
automatically approves, we're hiring.
Now, there's friction in there to where
like finance is coming in and saying,
why can't we just do this with AI?
That is true. Also, then the other piece
that I'm starting to notice is to your
point around AI is replacing what used
to be very like floor level job and now
it's like upleveling it. I'm actually
seeing that get bundled into existing
roles that are not entry level. So, for
example, I talked to Jeff Moore who runs
talented toast. He's like never really
believed in the sourcer model, but let's
just talk about sourcing. sourcing is
now being thrown into the recruiter's
job and there are very few sourcing
roles compared to what it used to look
like before. Like now that's part of a
full cycle recruiter's job and it's an
addition to what they were already
doing. So that's how I'm seeing that
play out. Now on the reader question
which is basically like hey like what
are programs who are companies that are
doing this? I know of one company that
is investing huge into early stage
talent right now and it's Coinbase.
That's the only company that I know of
that cares about this that is like put
the flag up and said we are going to do
it. Now what is true about Coinbase and
why does it matter?
Their leadership team wants this.
This isn't the chief people officer
saying like we should invest in new
grads. That's not what's happening
there. This is Brian Armstrong who's the
CEO and Emily Choy who's the COO saying,
"We believe we need to invest in the
next layer of talent here. We want to
grow these people internally. They're
going to bring skills that we don't
know." And so LJ, who's the chief
people, go execute on this thing, build
us a program and make it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen.
That's what's happening. Hey everyone,
we'll be right back in a moment after a
word from our sponsors.

I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather Doce
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out Metaview. I got into the
product and was like, "Wow, AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick." Metav is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver. Because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions, and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. Metivview covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Kora, and check out
MeteView. Head over to
metaviv.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that and Kelly sent
you or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up running and AI enabled in minutes.
We also talked about not entry level but
like the IC2 level tech folks accenting
on those folks because they're kind of
merging the both worlds, you know,
they're kind of in between who we were
and the new world. And I, you know, I'm
more I'm kind of intuitive this way and
I have a lot of opinions on people and
all this. Like honestly, Nolan, I think
a lot of the lack of movement in this
stuff has to do with human inertia. Like
you said it yourself, right? We're all
under pressure. Companies are dying or
trying to survive, you know, except for
a select few in certain industries. But
because of that, headcount is down.
People are having to do more jobs with
less. Like what is the one thing if I
was to go in and replace all of the
people processes with AI? It's just like
yay, we have AI. It's all gone. It takes
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and work and you are like
running on the hamster wheel at 3x speed
for maybe months to then run on it at.5
speed after. I think a lot of people are
shying away from running at 3x speed and
doing this because it is stressful. It
does take time. It's unproven. It's a
whole thing to pilot and experiment and
look at and people can barely like keep
their head above [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] water. I
continue to say it over and over. I
think it's the missing piece people are
saying is current state to AI. Yay. Yay.
And then they start walking across and
they're like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's going to
take a huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bridge to get here.
It's going to take a lot of like mental
horsepower and time and hours and
effort." And I don't think that we're
giving that enough credit as far as why
this isn't going faster. Okay. So, I
have a tangible example for you. Does it
support my point? No, it contradicts it.
Great. Okay. So, at dinner last week, I
was hearing we had a very small intimate
group of G people officers at the table
and I was hearing the same thing from
them of like how's anybody using it,
right? Like is it actually made any
change? Like sure I use chat GBT but
that's about it. So I run this other
podcast with Scavview team called Tennx
recruiting and in two weeks we're going
to post this specific episode but I will
give you the preview today. So we had
the head of recruiting from HPIQ1
and what they have done is they've
created a custom GPT and upload it into
the back end contextual information on
the company the product. They've put the
org chart in
they have put bios of each of the people
from the organization into the back end.
Then what they do is they record every
single interview.
using Metaview and then they upload, you
know, this is like six hours worth of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] transcripts. They take the whole
transcript from every conversation
interview panel and they put it in and
they say, "We're thinking about hiring
this person reporting to XYZ person on
XYZ team. Tell me what you think are the
green flags, red flags, yellow flags.
Tell me how you think this person's
going to fit in. Tell me if you think we
assess them right and if we missed
anything. And tell me if you think we
should hire them.
And we blurred out some of the context
here because obviously like it's
candidate sensitive and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got to
see a couple of these and I was like,
"Oh my god, like this is legitimately
better than humans."
And I had this conversation with one of
my buddies who's also in recruiting in
January and he was like, "Oh, my legal
team's really worried about AI and
making these decisions and AI bias and
stuff." I was like, "Bro, what are you
talking about?" And I saw this and I was
like, "I totally get what they're
talking about now." And by the way, to
your point on like how long does it take
to spin these things up? Yeah, that has
been compressed drastically. This was
set up in three hours in an afternoon.
That was my question. Who did this and
how? And the head of recruiting and the
reason the head of recruiting did it is
because there's a mandate from
leadership that they need to be using it
better. And they have examples from like
their engineering team to where now the
engineers are literally two to threex
more productive than they were before.
And they're like, why aren't you? why
aren't you making better decisions? And
so there's like a pressure test from
leadership here in this case that is
like you either do it or we you know I'm
not I don't know if this is true but
like this is how I interpreted it is
like you either do it or we find someone
that will right well there you go. So I
mentioned inertia earlier. I mentioned
kind of all these things when that
mandate comes top down all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
goes out the window. Yeah. Let me go
back really fast to this question from
one of our listeners. And you know her
question is like well what are these
programs? who's doing it really well.
And this is where I think like we as HR
people have this desire to build
programs like for whatever it is. It's
like when we say HR's like let's go
build a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] program. And I think you
should do exactly the opposite here,
right? If you want to run an experiment
here, hire one newrad or one intern and
be very specific about what you want,
which is like we want to hire like AI
intern, call it that, right? And we're
saying you're going to get essentially
no management, no guidance. you're going
to be just like the rest of us who have
always had bad managers and no guidance
and like we want you to come in and
design something with AI that adds
significant leverage to XYZ
organization. It's an easy bet. Yeah. I
just want to ask on that because I I
think we still see the emails. I still
see them almost daily. Like what is the
best tool for this? What program are you
using for that? And what I would say to
this listener and to be honest, I'm
getting used to it myself, right? 25
years in this business and changing
things. The notion of how things should
be done using what is all out the
window. It's gone. Do you use chatbt?
Yeah, we talked about this last week at
this event. Like even that question,
what companies are using AI for this
pro? I think it's going to be all
different shapes and sizes and I don't
think it's going to be one answer
anymore. I agree. That's actually a
really good point, Kelly, which is
people are looking for they're looking
for analoges. They're looking for like,
oh, well, you know, this company uses
this tool, so I'm going to use this
tool. But the thing is is like what I
learned with these custom GPTs, everyone
uses chat GPT now. But it's the custom
GPT context that adds the leverage and
the power and specifically the prompt.
And so that is all like you have to just
do that yourself. The biggest thing I
learned from this series and you guys
should listen to it. It's on 10x is this
stuff takes as short as 10 minutes to
set up initially.
That's what blew my mind. That's what
completely changed my game. Maybe I'll
do one. Maybe we should do one next week
about like the copywriter a that I built
that I'm now using for my LinkedIn
posts. And the first one that I used,
Kelly, with this copywriter thing, I had
to edit three words. It sounded just
like me. Oh my gosh. It was crazy. Gosh.
Well, I listened to a podcast last week
on the way to SF. Have you heard of this
board.ai?
Yeah, of course. It's incredible. Like
that person could be like your
recruiter. They used to be a T.
So maybe, you know, the jobs are getting
replaced, but like it's boardy.ai.io.
I was like, "Oh my gosh,
it is wild to me how much our actions
and tasks from years ago can literally
be done with AI thousands of times,
millions of times by like each minute."
That is the thing that I think that we
need to get really comfortable with is
not just like, oh, we're replacing three
people. This is like
replacing everybody. It's a brand new
paradigm. Yeah, exactly. So, the last
thing I'll mention is Gary Tan, who's
the CEO of Y Combinator, said last week,
"The alpha that exists in AI right now
is the biggest it will ever be because
we're all on the frontier trying to
figure it out together." And so, there
isn't like a here's the program in place
that you're going to have to invent it
from first principles from the
foundation level of your company. There
isn't another example that you're going
to be able to borrow from yet, but
that's what's going to be coming soon.
Wild. Yeah, fun times. So, good luck,
guys. Have fun out there. Thanks. All HR
