What's up everybody? Welcome back to
 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another HR heretics segment. Kelly, by
 
another HR heretics segment. Kelly, by
popular demand, we are going to do
 
popular demand, we are going to do
another Dear Heretics. So, let's get
 
another Dear Heretics. So, let's get
into this thing. All right. So, thanks
 
into this thing. All right. So, thanks
Nolan. I'm glad the conversation around
 
Nolan. I'm glad the conversation around
AI replacing entry-level jobs is finally
 
AI replacing entry-level jobs is finally
gaining traction as it's something I've
 
gaining traction as it's something I've
been thinking of and talking to folks
 
been thinking of and talking to folks
about for some time. There's two recent
 
about for some time. There's two recent
headlines. So, one is from Axios and
 
headlines. So, one is from Axios and
they are calling it like a you know the
 
they are calling it like a you know the
white collar blood bath specifically
 
white collar blood bath specifically
talking about how early stage jobs are
 
talking about how early stage jobs are
going away. Then Josh Buren who is a
 
going away. Then Josh Buren who is a
widely renowned HR author. He writes
 
widely renowned HR author. He writes
about HR stuff. His article is no
 
about HR stuff. His article is no
entry-level jobs are not going away. So
 
entry-level jobs are not going away. So
opposing views here, Kelly. And so what
 
opposing views here, Kelly. And so what
the author of this post says is, "While
 
the author of this post says is, "While
I fully agree with Josh Buren that
 
I fully agree with Josh Buren that
companies need young talent for
 
companies need young talent for
generational transition, innovation and
 
generational transition, innovation and
long-term success, I've heard virtually
 
long-term success, I've heard virtually
no example of companies actually putting
 
no example of companies actually putting
in the work now to redefine entry-level
 
in the work now to redefine entry-level
roles or rebuild talent programs. I feel
 
roles or rebuild talent programs. I feel
like most companies today are still very
 
like most companies today are still very
much in the mode of reducing staff and
 
much in the mode of reducing staff and
being as lean as possible. But to me,
 
being as lean as possible. But to me,
figuring out how to best leverage young
 
figuring out how to best leverage young
talent is as critical as ever as the AI
 
talent is as critical as ever as the AI
adoption innovation landscape is just
 
adoption innovation landscape is just
shifting so fast. So Josh says in his
 
shifting so fast. So Josh says in his
article that almost every HR or HR
 
article that almost every HR or HR
leader or head of recruiting told me
 
leader or head of recruiting told me
that they are rebuilding their
 
that they are rebuilding their
entry-level development programs for
 
entry-level development programs for
young employees. So what are the
 
young employees. So what are the
concrete examples? Would be awesome to
 
concrete examples? Would be awesome to
get people leaders to talk about this.
 
get people leaders to talk about this.
So Kelly, what's your take on this
 
So Kelly, what's your take on this
thing? Have you seen people actually
 
thing? Have you seen people actually
thinking about like bringing in young
 
thinking about like bringing in young
people and actually building programs
 
people and actually building programs
around this given the AI boom? I
 
around this given the AI boom? I
personally have not seen a lot of like
 
personally have not seen a lot of like
we're the rubber hitting the road here
 
we're the rubber hitting the road here
and you know it might be controversial
 
and you know it might be controversial
but I feel like that's been the whole
 
but I feel like that's been the whole
jam with this AI thing in general. It's
 
jam with this AI thing in general. It's
like woo AI but where is it happening?
 
like woo AI but where is it happening?
like you know we just went to a event
 
like you know we just went to a event
last week and I know you had a dinner
 
last week and I know you had a dinner
and I talked to about 50 people in
 
and I talked to about 50 people in
person after doing a live podcast and I
 
person after doing a live podcast and I
couldn't get a lot of like give it to me
 
couldn't get a lot of like give it to me
like let me touch it and feel what
 
like let me touch it and feel what
you're doing around this and so again I
 
you're doing around this and so again I
think we're kind of hovering over the
 
think we're kind of hovering over the
thing and there's a lot of talking about
 
thing and there's a lot of talking about
it but I haven't seen a lot of it like
 
it but I haven't seen a lot of it like
happening now let's pretend it is
 
happening now let's pretend it is
happening right let's fast forward into
 
happening right let's fast forward into
the future. I was talking to a a guy
 
the future. I was talking to a a guy
last week about AI and replacing
 
last week about AI and replacing
entry-level jobs and all these things.
 
entry-level jobs and all these things.
And I kind of had a point of like I
 
And I kind of had a point of like I
don't know if entry-level jobs are going
 
don't know if entry-level jobs are going
away. I just think the puck has moved as
 
away. I just think the puck has moved as
far as what the entrylevel job now is.
 
far as what the entrylevel job now is.
What do you mean? Say more. Let's just
 
What do you mean? Say more. Let's just
take I don't know. I don't even know the
 
take I don't know. I don't even know the
example, but let's just pretend like
 
example, but let's just pretend like
 
doing, you know, task A for an
 
doing, you know, task A for an
entry-level job. AI now does that. I
 
entry-level job. AI now does that. I
don't need to do task A with a human
 
don't need to do task A with a human
anymore. Yeah. But now the entry level
 
anymore. Yeah. But now the entry level
job is task B, one level up, because
 
job is task B, one level up, because
it's just the waterline has now changed.
 
it's just the waterline has now changed.
like the definition of what entry level
 
like the definition of what entry level
is now is changing because humans don't
 
is now is changing because humans don't
have to do the old entry level. Does
 
have to do the old entry level. Does
that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I
 
that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I
hear you on that. I have a slightly more
 
hear you on that. I have a slightly more
nuanced take on this. So my take is is
 
nuanced take on this. So my take is is
like number one, talk to any chief
 
like number one, talk to any chief
people officer at from growth to
 
people officer at from growth to
enterprise company and they will all
 
enterprise company and they will all
tell you headcounts basically flat or
 
tell you headcounts basically flat or
down from what it was in 2022. every
 
down from what it was in 2022. every
single one almost with uniform. It's
 
single one almost with uniform. It's
like we're flat or down. The other thing
 
like we're flat or down. The other thing
you will hear from these people, there's
 
you will hear from these people, there's
exceptions there, right? But like the
 
exceptions there, right? But like the
other thing you will hear from these
 
other thing you will hear from these
people is, okay, every time there's now
 
people is, okay, every time there's now
a backfill, we used to just
 
a backfill, we used to just
automatically approve it. So, you know,
 
automatically approve it. So, you know,
Jane submits her resignation, finance
 
Jane submits her resignation, finance
automatically approves, we're hiring.
 
automatically approves, we're hiring.
Now, there's friction in there to where
 
Now, there's friction in there to where
like finance is coming in and saying,
 
like finance is coming in and saying,
why can't we just do this with AI?
 
why can't we just do this with AI?
That is true. Also, then the other piece
 
That is true. Also, then the other piece
that I'm starting to notice is to your
 
that I'm starting to notice is to your
point around AI is replacing what used
 
point around AI is replacing what used
to be very like floor level job and now
 
to be very like floor level job and now
it's like upleveling it. I'm actually
 
it's like upleveling it. I'm actually
seeing that get bundled into existing
 
seeing that get bundled into existing
roles that are not entry level. So, for
 
roles that are not entry level. So, for
example, I talked to Jeff Moore who runs
 
example, I talked to Jeff Moore who runs
talented toast. He's like never really
 
talented toast. He's like never really
believed in the sourcer model, but let's
 
believed in the sourcer model, but let's
just talk about sourcing. sourcing is
 
just talk about sourcing. sourcing is
now being thrown into the recruiter's
 
now being thrown into the recruiter's
job and there are very few sourcing
 
job and there are very few sourcing
roles compared to what it used to look
 
roles compared to what it used to look
like before. Like now that's part of a
 
like before. Like now that's part of a
full cycle recruiter's job and it's an
 
full cycle recruiter's job and it's an
addition to what they were already
 
addition to what they were already
doing. So that's how I'm seeing that
 
doing. So that's how I'm seeing that
play out. Now on the reader question
 
play out. Now on the reader question
which is basically like hey like what
 
which is basically like hey like what
are programs who are companies that are
 
are programs who are companies that are
doing this? I know of one company that
 
doing this? I know of one company that
is investing huge into early stage
 
is investing huge into early stage
talent right now and it's Coinbase.
 
talent right now and it's Coinbase.
That's the only company that I know of
 
That's the only company that I know of
that cares about this that is like put
 
that cares about this that is like put
the flag up and said we are going to do
 
the flag up and said we are going to do
it. Now what is true about Coinbase and
 
it. Now what is true about Coinbase and
why does it matter?
 
why does it matter?
Their leadership team wants this.
 
Their leadership team wants this.
This isn't the chief people officer
 
This isn't the chief people officer
saying like we should invest in new
 
saying like we should invest in new
grads. That's not what's happening
 
grads. That's not what's happening
there. This is Brian Armstrong who's the
 
there. This is Brian Armstrong who's the
CEO and Emily Choy who's the COO saying,
 
CEO and Emily Choy who's the COO saying,
"We believe we need to invest in the
 
"We believe we need to invest in the
next layer of talent here. We want to
 
next layer of talent here. We want to
grow these people internally. They're
 
grow these people internally. They're
going to bring skills that we don't
 
going to bring skills that we don't
know." And so LJ, who's the chief
 
know." And so LJ, who's the chief
people, go execute on this thing, build
 
people, go execute on this thing, build
us a program and make it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen.
 
us a program and make it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen.

I must admit I used to believe that AI
 
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or

about their feelings instead of what

actually happened in the interview. And
 
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires

be up running and AI enabled in minutes.
We also talked about not entry level but
 
We also talked about not entry level but
like the IC2 level tech folks accenting
 
like the IC2 level tech folks accenting
on those folks because they're kind of
 
on those folks because they're kind of
merging the both worlds, you know,
 
merging the both worlds, you know,
they're kind of in between who we were
 
they're kind of in between who we were
and the new world. And I, you know, I'm
 
and the new world. And I, you know, I'm
more I'm kind of intuitive this way and
 
more I'm kind of intuitive this way and
I have a lot of opinions on people and
 
I have a lot of opinions on people and
all this. Like honestly, Nolan, I think
 
all this. Like honestly, Nolan, I think
a lot of the lack of movement in this
 
a lot of the lack of movement in this
stuff has to do with human inertia. Like
 
stuff has to do with human inertia. Like
you said it yourself, right? We're all
 
you said it yourself, right? We're all
under pressure. Companies are dying or
 
under pressure. Companies are dying or
trying to survive, you know, except for
 
trying to survive, you know, except for
a select few in certain industries. But
 
a select few in certain industries. But
because of that, headcount is down.
 
because of that, headcount is down.
People are having to do more jobs with
 
People are having to do more jobs with
less. Like what is the one thing if I
 
less. Like what is the one thing if I
was to go in and replace all of the
 
was to go in and replace all of the
people processes with AI? It's just like
 
people processes with AI? It's just like
yay, we have AI. It's all gone. It takes
 
yay, we have AI. It's all gone. It takes
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and work and you are like
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and work and you are like
running on the hamster wheel at 3x speed
 
running on the hamster wheel at 3x speed
for maybe months to then run on it at.5
 
for maybe months to then run on it at.5
speed after. I think a lot of people are
 
speed after. I think a lot of people are
shying away from running at 3x speed and
 
shying away from running at 3x speed and
doing this because it is stressful. It
 
doing this because it is stressful. It
does take time. It's unproven. It's a
 
does take time. It's unproven. It's a
whole thing to pilot and experiment and
 
whole thing to pilot and experiment and
look at and people can barely like keep
 
look at and people can barely like keep
their head above [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] water. I
 
their head above [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] water. I
continue to say it over and over. I
 
continue to say it over and over. I
think it's the missing piece people are
 
think it's the missing piece people are
saying is current state to AI. Yay. Yay.
 
saying is current state to AI. Yay. Yay.
And then they start walking across and
 
And then they start walking across and
they're like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's going to
 
they're like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's going to
take a huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bridge to get here.
 
take a huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bridge to get here.
It's going to take a lot of like mental
 
It's going to take a lot of like mental
horsepower and time and hours and
 
horsepower and time and hours and
effort." And I don't think that we're
 
effort." And I don't think that we're
giving that enough credit as far as why
 
giving that enough credit as far as why
this isn't going faster. Okay. So, I
 
this isn't going faster. Okay. So, I
have a tangible example for you. Does it
 
have a tangible example for you. Does it
support my point? No, it contradicts it.
 
support my point? No, it contradicts it.
Great. Okay. So, at dinner last week, I
 
Great. Okay. So, at dinner last week, I
was hearing we had a very small intimate
 
was hearing we had a very small intimate
group of G people officers at the table
 
group of G people officers at the table
and I was hearing the same thing from
 
and I was hearing the same thing from
them of like how's anybody using it,
 
them of like how's anybody using it,
right? Like is it actually made any
 
right? Like is it actually made any
change? Like sure I use chat GBT but
 
change? Like sure I use chat GBT but
that's about it. So I run this other
 
that's about it. So I run this other
podcast with Scavview team called Tennx
 
podcast with Scavview team called Tennx
recruiting and in two weeks we're going
 
recruiting and in two weeks we're going
to post this specific episode but I will
 
to post this specific episode but I will
give you the preview today. So we had
 
give you the preview today. So we had
the head of recruiting from HPIQ1
 
the head of recruiting from HPIQ1
and what they have done is they've
 
and what they have done is they've
created a custom GPT and upload it into
 
created a custom GPT and upload it into
the back end contextual information on
 
the back end contextual information on
the company the product. They've put the
 
the company the product. They've put the
org chart in
 
org chart in
they have put bios of each of the people
 
they have put bios of each of the people
from the organization into the back end.
 
from the organization into the back end.
Then what they do is they record every
 
Then what they do is they record every
single interview.
 
single interview.
using Metaview and then they upload, you
 
using Metaview and then they upload, you
know, this is like six hours worth of
 
know, this is like six hours worth of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] transcripts. They take the whole
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] transcripts. They take the whole
transcript from every conversation
 
transcript from every conversation
interview panel and they put it in and
 
interview panel and they put it in and
they say, "We're thinking about hiring
 
they say, "We're thinking about hiring
this person reporting to XYZ person on
 
this person reporting to XYZ person on
XYZ team. Tell me what you think are the
 
XYZ team. Tell me what you think are the
green flags, red flags, yellow flags.
 
green flags, red flags, yellow flags.
Tell me how you think this person's
 
Tell me how you think this person's
going to fit in. Tell me if you think we
 
going to fit in. Tell me if you think we
assess them right and if we missed
 
assess them right and if we missed
anything. And tell me if you think we
 
anything. And tell me if you think we
should hire them.
 
should hire them.
And we blurred out some of the context
 
And we blurred out some of the context
here because obviously like it's
 
here because obviously like it's
candidate sensitive and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got to
 
candidate sensitive and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got to
see a couple of these and I was like,
 
see a couple of these and I was like,
"Oh my god, like this is legitimately
 
"Oh my god, like this is legitimately
better than humans."
 
better than humans."
And I had this conversation with one of
 
And I had this conversation with one of
my buddies who's also in recruiting in
 
my buddies who's also in recruiting in
January and he was like, "Oh, my legal
 
January and he was like, "Oh, my legal
team's really worried about AI and
 
team's really worried about AI and
making these decisions and AI bias and
 
making these decisions and AI bias and
stuff." I was like, "Bro, what are you
 
stuff." I was like, "Bro, what are you
talking about?" And I saw this and I was
 
talking about?" And I saw this and I was
like, "I totally get what they're
 
like, "I totally get what they're
talking about now." And by the way, to
 
talking about now." And by the way, to
your point on like how long does it take
 
your point on like how long does it take
to spin these things up? Yeah, that has
 
to spin these things up? Yeah, that has
been compressed drastically. This was
 
been compressed drastically. This was
set up in three hours in an afternoon.
 
set up in three hours in an afternoon.
That was my question. Who did this and
 
That was my question. Who did this and
how? And the head of recruiting and the
 
how? And the head of recruiting and the
reason the head of recruiting did it is
 
reason the head of recruiting did it is
because there's a mandate from
 
because there's a mandate from
leadership that they need to be using it
 
leadership that they need to be using it
better. And they have examples from like
 
better. And they have examples from like
their engineering team to where now the
 
their engineering team to where now the
engineers are literally two to threex
 
engineers are literally two to threex
more productive than they were before.
 
more productive than they were before.
And they're like, why aren't you? why
 
And they're like, why aren't you? why
aren't you making better decisions? And
 
aren't you making better decisions? And
so there's like a pressure test from
 
so there's like a pressure test from
leadership here in this case that is
 
leadership here in this case that is
like you either do it or we you know I'm
 
like you either do it or we you know I'm
not I don't know if this is true but
 
not I don't know if this is true but
like this is how I interpreted it is
 
like this is how I interpreted it is
like you either do it or we find someone
 
like you either do it or we find someone
that will right well there you go. So I
 
that will right well there you go. So I
mentioned inertia earlier. I mentioned
 
mentioned inertia earlier. I mentioned
kind of all these things when that
 
kind of all these things when that
mandate comes top down all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
mandate comes top down all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
goes out the window. Yeah. Let me go
 
goes out the window. Yeah. Let me go

different shapes and sizes and I don't
 
different shapes and sizes and I don't
think it's going to be one answer
 
think it's going to be one answer
anymore. I agree. That's actually a
 
anymore. I agree. That's actually a
really good point, Kelly, which is
 
really good point, Kelly, which is
people are looking for they're looking
 
people are looking for they're looking
for analoges. They're looking for like,
 
for analoges. They're looking for like,
oh, well, you know, this company uses
 
oh, well, you know, this company uses
this tool, so I'm going to use this
 
this tool, so I'm going to use this

tool. But the thing is is like what I
learned with these custom GPTs, everyone
 
learned with these custom GPTs, everyone
uses chat GPT now. But it's the custom
 
uses chat GPT now. But it's the custom
GPT context that adds the leverage and
 
GPT context that adds the leverage and
the power and specifically the prompt.
 
the power and specifically the prompt.
And so that is all like you have to just
 
And so that is all like you have to just
do that yourself. The biggest thing I
 
do that yourself. The biggest thing I
learned from this series and you guys
 
learned from this series and you guys
should listen to it. It's on 10x is this
 
should listen to it. It's on 10x is this
stuff takes as short as 10 minutes to
 
stuff takes as short as 10 minutes to
set up initially.
 
set up initially.
That's what blew my mind. That's what
 
That's what blew my mind. That's what
completely changed my game. Maybe I'll
 
completely changed my game. Maybe I'll

about like the copywriter a that I built
 
about like the copywriter a that I built
that I'm now using for my LinkedIn
 
that I'm now using for my LinkedIn
posts. And the first one that I used,
 
posts. And the first one that I used,
Kelly, with this copywriter thing, I had
 
Kelly, with this copywriter thing, I had
to edit three words. It sounded just
 
to edit three words. It sounded just
like me. Oh my gosh. It was crazy. Gosh.
 
like me. Oh my gosh. It was crazy. Gosh.

on the way to SF. Have you heard of this
board.ai?
 
board.ai?
Yeah, of course. It's incredible. Like
 
Yeah, of course. It's incredible. Like
that person could be like your
 
that person could be like your
recruiter. They used to be a T.
 
recruiter. They used to be a T.
So maybe, you know, the jobs are getting
 
So maybe, you know, the jobs are getting
replaced, but like it's boardy.ai.io.
 
replaced, but like it's boardy.ai.io.
I was like, "Oh my gosh,
 
I was like, "Oh my gosh,
it is wild to me how much our actions
 
it is wild to me how much our actions
and tasks from years ago can literally
 
and tasks from years ago can literally
be done with AI thousands of times,
 
be done with AI thousands of times,
millions of times by like each minute."
 
millions of times by like each minute."
That is the thing that I think that we
 
That is the thing that I think that we
need to get really comfortable with is
 
need to get really comfortable with is
not just like, oh, we're replacing three
 
not just like, oh, we're replacing three
people. This is like
 
people. This is like
replacing everybody. It's a brand new
 
replacing everybody. It's a brand new
paradigm. Yeah, exactly. So, the last
 
paradigm. Yeah, exactly. So, the last
thing I'll mention is Gary Tan, who's
 
thing I'll mention is Gary Tan, who's
the CEO of Y Combinator, said last week,
 
the CEO of Y Combinator, said last week,
"The alpha that exists in AI right now

is the biggest it will ever be because
 
is the biggest it will ever be because
we're all on the frontier trying to
 
we're all on the frontier trying to
figure it out together." And so, there
 
figure it out together." And so, there
isn't like a here's the program in place
 
isn't like a here's the program in place
that you're going to have to invent it
 
that you're going to have to invent it
from first principles from the
