eliminations redundancy obviously
performance is a factor in deciding who
 
performance is a factor in deciding who
one of many but I just want to be clear
 
one of many but I just want to be clear
about that because some might say oh
 
about that because some might say oh
take the bottom 5% and riff them the
 
take the bottom 5% and riff them the
path to doing that is not through
 
path to doing that is not through
Performance
 
Performance
Management uh you mean is not is not
 
Management uh you mean is not is not
through just like riffing the path to
 
through just like riffing the path to
cutting those 10% immediately like Tesla
 
cutting those 10% immediately like Tesla
is done through a riff that is
 
is done through a riff that is
determined by usually job eliminations
 
determined by usually job eliminations
due to redundancy or yeah they're
 
due to redundancy or yeah they're
categorizing it that way and they're
 
categorizing it that way and they're
eating the bullet that they can't hire
 
eating the bullet that they can't hire
that Ro back for 6 months but then they
 
that Ro back for 6 months but then they
typically are so like let's be honest
 
typically are so like let's be honest
about what's like actually happening
 
about what's like actually happening
there yeah so I'm just saying they
 
there yeah so I'm just saying they
they're they're solving for an apple and
 
they're they're solving for an apple and
to solve for the Apple they eat an
 
to solve for the Apple they eat an
orange is what I'm saying yeah okay so
 
orange is what I'm saying yeah okay so
then here's what I would do in this
 
then here's what I would do in this
situation and how I have responded in
 
situation and how I have responded in
these situations when it's come to me is
 
these situations when it's come to me is
uh okay I got it like let me have a
 
uh okay I got it like let me have a
think on it and I'll come back and
 
think on it and I'll come back and
present you a plan then what I go think
 
present you a plan then what I go think
what I'm really thinking about is like
 
what I'm really thinking about is like
how do I package this in a way that is
 
how do I package this in a way that is
right for the business and right for the
 
right for the business and right for the
people and it typically sounds something
 
people and it typically sounds something
like this hey Mr or Mrs CEO uh I had to
 
like this hey Mr or Mrs CEO uh I had to
think and here's the way I think we can
 
think and here's the way I think we can
eliminate the bottom percentage of the
 
eliminate the bottom percentage of the
company while also ensuring that we
 
company while also ensuring that we
deliver feedback to our top performers
 
deliver feedback to our top performers
so they know that they're doing super
 
so they know that they're doing super
well um to to tell our uh our middle of
 
well um to to tell our uh our middle of
the- pack performers what they need to
 
the- pack performers what they need to
do to be to become top performers and
 
do to be to become top performers and
then for our bot performers to give them
 
then for our bot performers to give them
enough time to see if they turn it
 
enough time to see if they turn it
around otherwise we manage them out and
 
around otherwise we manage them out and
this is what that plan looks like yeah I
 
this is what that plan looks like yeah I
think
 
think
oftentimes we get so caught up in the
 
oftentimes we get so caught up in the
moment of like go fire the bottom 5% and
 
moment of like go fire the bottom 5% and
and the the fight ORF flight response
 
and the the fight ORF flight response
that that puts us in that we don't think
 
that that puts us in that we don't think
clearly and so my number one piece of
 
clearly and so my number one piece of
feedback to somebody who's in this
 
feedback to somebody who's in this
situation is to take a breath like tell
 
situation is to take a breath like tell
them you're on it go sleep on it wake up
 
them you're on it go sleep on it wake up
early in the morning and write down
 
early in the morning and write down
exactly how you would do it if you were
 
exactly how you would do it if you were
to be to doing it the best way possible
 
to be to doing it the best way possible
and then go present that as the plan
 
and then go present that as the plan
with the trade-offs of doing it that way
 
with the trade-offs of doing it that way
versus elon's way yeah and I would add
 
versus elon's way yeah and I would add
write down why you're doing it what what
 
write down why you're doing it what what
does this tie into why are you even
 
does this tie into why are you even
thinking about how to do this um because
 
thinking about how to do this um because
that's the point and I love what you
 
that's the point and I love what you
said because this is I gave this
 
said because this is I gave this
feedback to so many people about founder
 
feedback to so many people about founder
