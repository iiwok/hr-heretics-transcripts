what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics Kelly
before we get into this one uh today is
January 9th and fires are raging in Los
Angeles last I checked a couple of hours
ago we're still at 0% containment
I know of a couple of friends who have
been evacuated I know of more friends
who are like super scared right now I
know this is not what we sign up for
when we do this podcast right like we
talk about tech we talk about HR stuff
people come to us for a distraction and
so we'll try and get to that in a second
but before we do I just want to tell
everybody that our hearts are going out
to you like this is an unbelievable
situation happening in one of the
biggest cities in our country like it's
it's truly like unfathomable to see
these photos of Malibu and the palad
like it's crazy to me and so um before
we get into this I just want to say it
feels a little bit trit for us to just
be on like a normal podcast schedule um
compared to like what's going on in the
world right now and so I just want to
say that my family we're praying for you
all and I I put this out on LinkedIn
earlier today but seriously like if
you're a listener um and you're impacted
and you're evacuated and you need a
place to go we have two two rooms at my
house uh I also have two very loud
children who can either view it as like
a I'm going to take your mind off of
this thing or uh like distract you in
maybe good maybe bad ways but please
ping me we would love to host you here
yeah yeah thanks Nolan I I agree H H
happy New Year everyone first of all and
um yeah Nolan it's it's been brutal
watching this over the past you know
couple days and I think I mentioned I
recently took on an interim Chief people
officer role here at Quizlet in San
Francisco
and we have I think about 30 employees
in LA and we were reaching out to every
single one of them today and it's just
been you know evacuations and how we can
support them and I don't know I will be
honest it it became very real for me the
past like I don't know
 
it was a h and then it just all of a
sudden you know really got intense and
it's it is hard to see and a little bit
surreal very surreal well you just think
with the fire like we're g to extinguish
it yeah yeah well you know what I mean
like it's just like we're conditioned to
be like oh yeah like we have like
figured out how to solve especially in a
major Metropolitan City yeah and it's
just it's scary you know and they say
these wind the timing of things right
these winds being up to 100 miles per
hour and you just see this stuff up
close and my brother's a firefighter and
it's just I don't know it's all it's all
hard to wrap your head around and so so
sometimes it's hard to be like oh we sit
here and talk about tech and we
pontificate and this is happening yeah
totally I got a couple of friends that
are Hot Shots um and that go after like
the wildfires uh that went to high
school with me and the the photos I'm
seeing out of the Palisades is like like
it reminds me of like the paradise fire
a couple years ago totally and it's the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
Palisades like I don't know I for me I'm
I'm still having to your point like I'm
having a hard time comprehending it
still like it doesn't make sense and um
anyways like there's a lot of stuff that
we should get to on this topic
eventually but today I just want to get
to like everybody like we're thinking of
you and if you need something like Ping
us like we would love to help you for
sure so all right K let's get to a
segment here um let's do a little dear
Heretics love dear
Heretics this I think you love it
because it was a great idea of yours
it's a great great concept
all right here we go I'll read in s
right all right hi Kelly and Nolan I'm
an hrbp at a big tech company and find
so much value in your podcast this is
like the stroking the ego thing always
do this when you send us emails we love
this more than anything um I really
appreciate the Frank and honest
conversation yeah yeah yeah okay so my
question is related to Performance
Management what are your thoughts on
mandated
 
I've observed these mandated targets
Drive poor behavior from Frontline
managers behaviors such as not genuinely
coaching an employee over indexing on
one metric rather than holistically
looking at the performance compared to
expectations for the role level lack of
ownership from Frontline managers who
feel forced to meet a Target um what
have you seen done well what are the
downsides to these targets how can an
hrbp show up best in these discussions
and help managers get to the right
outcomes what's your take Kelly
yeah this has been a ongoing
conversation right noan I mean since I
started in in this industry in this
function 24 years ago it's been a topic
and like anything I I I really don't
think there's one right answer or not
the question is why are we doing this
you know and I do think I have seen that
lack of forcing or whatnot it we've said
it before on this show that people don't
like giving hard feedback it's hard for
people right and so I do actually
think that mandating that we do need to
talk about who is under the bar and what
that bar means and what that looks like
is helpful I actually do now what's not
helpful when I think a lot of companies
do is take this on absolute terms right
let's just rank everyone and make
decisions and show it I think what you
have to do with something like this is
fuse in context and individual
situations
and what the certain Dynamics are
surrounding about individual are you
know what I mean but if an
organization's like everyone's
great that's not that that that's that I
I don't I don't agree with that and I do
think that a lot of a lot of companies
that aren't good at this in the absence
of something like this everyone will be
meet or great I have seen that yeah so I
actually like it but I like it because
it forces
conversation not because you rank
everyone on paper and you fire the ones
that are out immediately does that make
sense yeah let me so let me tell you how
I let me guess how this showed up to the
person who wrote in you know she she's
like sitting at her desk having a great
day enjoying her coffee and See's like
slacks her like hey come into my office
have an idea and she walks in and CEO is
like I think we should remove the bottom
 
organization and she's like what the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I think this is what what when
CE
or leaders say stuff like this what I
have found is that what they say is not
actually exactly what they mean and our
job specifically in HR and people Ops is
to massage that into a way that makes
sense for the business and the people
and so an example of this where it's
really not done well but they get away
with it because they have like
incredible product Market fit is Tesla
every year at Tesla they do a 10% riff
of the company and it's just like boom
get out of here there's never any
feedback delivered um you know Colleen
has talked about this in on the show
Kelly and she's called it like the the
Weight Watchers crash diet and it's the
Perfect Analogy um it's not done well
Tesla's culture uh is a little bit of a
culture in fear um and so like that's
the second order of like if you run it
that way the benefit is you can move
super fast you can just like blanket cut
people the challenge is is that you're
going to have people living in fear and
it you know I always say treat people
the way you want to be treated you would
never want to be treated that way if you
didn't know how you were performing so
that's one way to do
it hey everyone we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors I
must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got the product and
was like Wow AI actually does exist in
recruiting and this product is sick
metav view is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for recruiting
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metaview changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out medavie head over to metav
view. a/ Heretics to talk to one of
Met's product experts tell them that me
and Kelly sent you or you could just go
to their website and get started for
free you'll be up running and AI enabled
in
minutes now way that though the the the
dirty little secret about that friends
is that is not done under the umbrella
of Performance Management right those
those 10% riffs are usually done under
the umbrella of riffs due to job
eliminations redundancy obviously
performance is a factor in deciding who
one of many but I just want to be clear
about that because some might say oh
take the bottom 5% and riff them the
path to doing that is not through
Performance
Management uh you mean is not is not
through just like riffing the path to
cutting those 10% immediately like Tesla
is done through a riff that is
determined by usually job eliminations
due to redundancy or yeah they're
categorizing it that way and they're
eating the bullet that they can't hire
that Ro back for 6 months but then they
typically are so like let's be honest
about what's like actually happening
there yeah so I'm just saying they
they're they're solving for an apple and
to solve for the Apple they eat an
orange is what I'm saying yeah okay so
then here's what I would do in this
situation and how I have responded in
these situations when it's come to me is
uh okay I got it like let me have a
think on it and I'll come back and
present you a plan then what I go think
what I'm really thinking about is like
how do I package this in a way that is
right for the business and right for the
people and it typically sounds something
like this hey Mr or Mrs CEO uh I had to
think and here's the way I think we can
eliminate the bottom percentage of the
company while also ensuring that we
deliver feedback to our top performers
so they know that they're doing super
well um to to tell our uh our middle of
the- pack performers what they need to
do to be to become top performers and
then for our bot performers to give them
enough time to see if they turn it
around otherwise we manage them out and
this is what that plan looks like yeah I
think
oftentimes we get so caught up in the
moment of like go fire the bottom 5% and
and the the fight ORF flight response
that that puts us in that we don't think
clearly and so my number one piece of
feedback to somebody who's in this
situation is to take a breath like tell
them you're on it go sleep on it wake up
early in the morning and write down
exactly how you would do it if you were
to be to doing it the best way possible
and then go present that as the plan
with the trade-offs of doing it that way
versus elon's way yeah and I would add
write down why you're doing it what what
does this tie into why are you even
thinking about how to do this um because
that's the point and I love what you
said because this is I gave this
feedback to so many people about founder
CEOs in the past I'm like listen listen
because let's just pick a name I haven't
worked with because Janet says jump the
worst thing you can do is jump when Jan
says jump because you will jump and
they'll be like what did you do all this
stuff went wrong and all this is messed
up you told me to jump yeah but I I
didn't mean like jump like so the best
thing you can do to use your words when
that happens is take a breath
internalize it for yourself have a point
of view because you can't do anything to
get close to what they're saying unless
you actually have your own point of view
on how to get there because a CEO and
you're totally right this is how it
happens hey we gota we got to cut the
bottom 5
percent they have no idea what it takes
to cross that bridge and all the
complexities complications and risks
legal or cultural in doing so and that's
your job is to translate that yeah in a
way where they can actually swallow it
the the other thing I'll add so you you
say the why I always find it's like
really helpful for a CEO when I can
reframe the problem they're trying to
solve so like when somebody like when a
CEO says when Janet says Hey fire the
bottom
 
back the next day I think actually the
way you start this is like Janet I think
the problem we're solving is that we've
gotten too bloated totally right which
which is another version of the why yeah
ex EXA exactly but I that framing for me
is like that it solves so many problem
because Janet Janet feels heard yes
right and then because Janet feels heard
she's she's trusting you that you're
going to go execute on her she doesn't
give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about the details totally
like she wants the problem solved and if
I'm internalizing a lot of this audience
the details of these very trit like you
know highlevel phrases that CEOs throw
out we all we all go through the details
in our heads like like you know white
light like it all goes through so fast
and that causes us anxiety and that
causes us worry and then we present that
back to the CEO in the moment and they
see us as no people as tactical as
police and that's what I think the issue
is and so to your point of taking a
breath reframing thinking about their
why the next day going side by side with
them holding hands with them and guiding
them down the path versus kind of
butting heads in the moment with your
anxiety that's valid that's the Dirty
Secrets it's all valid exactly this is
how you influence in these situations
and you know I think a lot of us have
had this Nolan like pre- pandemic premro
environment kind of swinged everyone was
happy making money things kind of
loosened up and we heard this from
boards the past three years you've
gotten too nice you've gotten too lazy
clamp down and for a lot of companies
that's going from zero to 100 where
you're seeing these statements of like
we never did this before now go fire the
bottom 5 per. totally the the the no
person comment by the way like I think
is like
more it's the worst person it's the
worst version of yourself you can be to
the
CEO because when you get branded as the
the team of no or the person of no it's
a matter of time before that bullseye on
your back get so big that they're gonna
find you
yeah Andrew Andrew bartlo our friend
Andrew bartlo calls it HR Island and
that's how you end up on HR island is if
you just say no we can't do this yeah
and it's it's really sad
because most of the time those people
are right like that's that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
of it is that all the reasons you're
feeling that anxiety and that like it's
actually correct but it's a matter of
not being right it's being effective and
so how can you take all that merge it
with what the CEO is saying they want
and create a third door like that's the
goal that's the art that's the
art it's all I got that's a great
question keep it coming everyone dear
