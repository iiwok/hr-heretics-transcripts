## Transcript

 
[Applause]
[Music]
 
what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment we have
friend of the Pod long time no talk
Colleen mccre what's up Colleen
hello I I'm still a listener I may not
have been a participant but I an active
subscriber to the Pod and I sometimes
yell at you in my car how about that I
know and she'll text us she'll and I
text although I I've held back recently
but I I
occasionally have do you know why she's
held back Nolan because she works she
works job unlike the rest of us
degenerate she's working full time I was
going to say I don't get many hate texts
anymore Colleen I'm too I'm have too
much I am busy um and by the time I can
get around to actually saying what the
hell did you say today why did you say
that I have lost the in all seriousness
do you remember the last time you yelled
in your car during episode and what it
was
about uh well I the most recent one I
listened to was the Jamie Diamond
episode so I'm actually pretty caught up
I think um and I actually work for a all
remote company now so I am in this like
complete opposite world I did agree 100%
with Nolan and I think Kelly you also
said like I think that was totally
scripted I don't think I don't think
Jamie Diamond does anything without uh
thinking about it 10 steps ahead of time
that man is way too wise to the
world um and I you know AG you all have
said the same thing that I have said
that it's all about expectation setting
and being being clear about who you are
and what you're promising and I actually
thought you were um a little nice nicer
than I thought you would be in that
episode about
um letting people off easy with Kelly
you were very generous about the like
well you know people got comfortable and
they just assumed they'd be get to like
work from home forever and they just
built these expectations that this is
the way of working and I think think I'm
overly sensitive on that topic because
when it was the very hip thing for
everybody to be remote I was the head of
people at a company that was very much
requiring everybody to go back to the
office and having to hold the line on
that and was very clear with people do
not move you are going to have to come
back this is our choice this is our way
of working and also saying like if this
isn't for you you should go work
somewhere else and at the time there
were a lot of other options for people
unlike kind of right now and so I think
I feel a just probably an ounce of
bitterness around this of having taken
so much
crap um but also feeling like I was very
authentic and very honest with
people um during that time and I'm very
proud of the fact that that company was
so honest and with people about this
like yeah was not willing to you know
lie to people or pull the rug out
because that's what I think was the
crappiest about so many of these things
that to Kelly to your note like these
people got very comfortable and in many
cases we're told like they were Amazon
or Google or Robin Hood or all of these
companies that were told like we're
remote first you should go live wherever
you want we're totally cool with it and
we're like nope not anymore back in the
office like right now the whip the Whip
sign was insane
and this isn't the topic for today
obviously so sorry to ask the question
but it's so it's so funny because you
were episode number two on this podcast
like years ago now I think at least one
year ago and Clarity of identity you
know what I mean it's so interesting
because common theme it's a com it's the
thread that goes all the way through but
you it's and and it just depends you're
a CPO now at a all remote company and
you were the one saying we're in your
other company so it's just so funny how
this industry works and you could be in
any situation both work it turns out
both turns out both work right like call
very don't work hav don't I disagree I
disagree like those companies that
Colleen just mentioned are still hiring
like people are working there right they
change their minds uh you know no but I
mean if you're like kind of doing both
changing your mind is different then
we're kind of we don't know which one we
are is yeah I I I guess that that's
right all right so let's let's set the
scene for people which is like I guess I
guess that's right Colleen you're back
you're now back as a chief people
officer again uh God knows why I'm not
going to ask you but I I do want to ask
whole blog post if people are really
curious on my blog I wrote about why I
went it's actually very good I'm giving
you okay I want to know from the
last time that you were in the seat to
now what has changed yeah um well I
mean there's the company there's the
mindset and then there's just sort of
the world right so
um the world has changed quite a bit
because the last time I was in the seat
it was still this sort of great
resignation time frame right and now we
are in the no resignation to some extent
time frame no I don't think that is
fully true I'm I'm I'm obviously taking
the extremes and when you make this your
little LinkedIn sound bite and I get
hammered all over the place um there's
plenty of attrition to go around um and
the Cy
world that as I am old um will tell you
is that like having gone through this in
 
in 2008 2009 and maybe some Blitz in the
mid you know 201 teens time frame like I
know that it will come back around
number one and I know number two is that
top talent always has a place to go like
the best people always have a they're
always sought after they it doesn't
matter what role you are in it doesn't
matter um where you are at like you will
always be you know people will always be
fighting for you so I I know all of that
is true um and I see it in my own
company you know where I definitely see
people who make the choice to to opt out
and find other things for all all
different reasons so I am still very
attuned to that but the degree of which
that was happening before and that sort
of dynamic of you know sort of what you
all have spoken about in many of your
episodes of the employee to an employer
control um has definitely shifted um
whether or not the employer chooses to
grab those re and how tightly they want
to grab them and how much power they
want to and I mean I think that's
company to company and how they they
sort of implement that and then you know
my own philosophy as a cheap people
officer like who would I work I would
never work somewhere that that sort of
is that kind of hard ass place in that
way like abuses that power I think you
should still be principled and valued
and like we're making decisions for
these reasons and give the context but
but certainly I'm seeing it all over the
place in a way I'd never seen um it is I
am seeing this shift and we had already
been seeing this when I wasn't an
operator when I was in the investing
kind of World um but the shift away from
sort of you know tilting all the way too
far I think one way on De and to another
direction of like all the way the
anti-de Andi I was seeing that already
in Silicon Valley and I think the sort
of national conversation obviously
shifted in a whole different way um so
that has definitely like the ground has
changed and now there's uh Nolan has
seen some text on this but like
certainly like the amount and lack of
clarity kind of nationally state to
state internationally what that does to
you how you respond what you need to do
like that you know just in the last six
eight weeks of like what your world
looks like I would not have predicted
that um that that sort of scenario um
and then just I think
the what has not changed I should say at
that sort of big level is the still
that there are companies that I think
are really good at appreciating what HR
is and what the expectation of a two
people officer is and you know and I of
course feel like I would only choose to
work at those companies that has a
strong appreciation for that and I you
know I think certainly that where I
chose to go had a an understanding of
that um but just the dialogue that still
happens you know amongst employees and
managers and leaders around what is
what's hr's responsibility what's a
manager responsibility what's the what's
the company's responsibility it just
continues to crack me up some days um
where and now I have a now the
difference between two two and a half
years ago or whatever to now is I have a
college student so now I am very focused
on I'm going to have somebody in the
workforce soon and like what does that
mean and how do you I I'm actively
thinking about this all the time like I
am soon going to be the parent of
somebody who is in someone else's
Workforce yeah so so yeah one one theme
you just hit on there which I've been
thinking a lot about is what is what is
the job of a cheap people officer today
and I actually think there's deep
misalignment with that so when you
started like walk us through your first
like 90 120 days like did you try and
create alignment on that companywide and
what did you
do yeah so I always think it depends on
what kind of company you're joining if
they've had a chief people officer
before if they haven't are you you know
are you following someone's footsteps
are you are you not are you establishing
the role the company I joined is a
public company so I think that that's
important context we have employees in
 
been around for 10 years um they have
had two other Chief people officers so
it's not like somebody hasn't been in
the role I am a very different flavor of
Chief people officers has been at this
company too so there is certainly that
and I will tell you I also have a very
public blog I have a lot of podcasts
including this one that was on the
record um so it's not like when I was
announced that no one could know
anything about me so that's also I think
a
Nuance um if you think about it like if
you have a public Persona you should
think about the fact that your employees
are probably going to dig up that public
Persona in fact I don't think I had been
announced for two hours before someone
pulled up a click from Silicon Valley
the TV show and said is this you um and
it's true like it is on my LinkedIn it's
something that people often make jokes
about I think it was even in like the
introduction that like oh she was a
character on from you know there's a
character based on her in silen Valley
and so you know sort of that kicks off
something and so you know I think in my
case there's a little bit which is
helpful like there's some context out
there that sort of opens the door and I
had had that conversation with the CEO
in the process of the fact of like I am
not going to come in as this white page
that no one knows anything about
um because I have this very uh public
presence and my beliefs and philosophies
are out there um which are not all in
alignment with the CEO so there's some
questions there um going can I ask you a
question how did that like very public
brand which of course did did you see
that or feel that more or less than you
thought you would when you joined like
to uh did your reputation prede you did
people know did it impact your
integration like yeah I mean I I I think
it helped because it took the mystery
away um yeah and I'm also very
transparent so I really tried to lean in
with my own HR team around like the AMA
and I'm usually a completely
non-anonymous person I hate Anonymous
anything but the first couple meetings I
allowed Anonymous just because of this
like
you never know I am a little
scary um I can come across as very
having very strong W and a lot of strong
opinions so I was much more open to it
initially and now I of course done away
with of course it's gone yeah but I
initially I allowed it for a while to
create some form of trust and confidence
um yeah well yeah you got to create that
environment um and they had been through
a lot of change so you have to recognize
where where your own team is where the
company is what has happened so I think
you have to put some some context
boundaries um so I think it helped in
that way and then you know my first all
hands with the whole company um I was
willing to sort of answer whatever and
we established an Ask eaff Channel which
is a sort of Legacy thing that I have
had at a couple of other companies where
and I was willing right out of the gate
to answer not just about myself but like
philosophically what I thought um and I
clashed with my CEO and I think my first
all hands or my second one we clashed on
philosophically around performance
reviews so it's I think a good
interaction to like kind of see us
publicly be human be human have human
conv necessarily agree we're gonna have
we're going to work through this we
haven't decided on the road ahead we
yeah didn't agree in the interview
process we decided to put a pin in it
we're going to try and get to a you know
like try and influence each other on our
point of view like to
hey everyone we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors I
must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview and
I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards view changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out metaview head over to metav
view. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
metav View's product experts tell them
that me and Kelly sent you or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free you'll be up running and AI
enabled in
minutes so I don't believe in hiding who
I am I can't at this age like I'm just
too Life's too short and I've been doing
this for too long it also helped I will
say when you have whatever reputation
you
have um I think early in my career I
tried to run from it more and you know
like whatever is on blind that I've
never read and I've never been a member
of so I don't really know what it says
and whatever um or what's on glass door
I you know people are going to know
someone who knows someone it's been
helpful to me now that there are ex
employees who have worked with me over
the years and I do know that a couple
people said like oh my God I worked with
her before and I really liked the
companies she worked at which was kind
of a nice thing to have I'm sure some
other people said the opposite she's a
horrible human who made my life
miserable I don't
know you can't make everybody happy or
else you're failing in my opinion as you
all also I think see so um but the other
thing is like I literally did 200 one-on
ones from company two 200 one-on ones in
my first 60 days um I wrote up a just
like I always do I did a six-page Amazon
style of like here are all the themes
that I heard I triangulated from the
employee
survey um some themes I talked about
them what I was hearing in all hands
meetings so I did not shy away from like
here are some things I'm hearing this is
what I've heard what I read in the
employee survey this is what I'm
planning to do and why um the other
thing though I think that made me
actually very popular very quickly at
this company and the biggest thing is
like you got to put wins on the board
and like exactly going after in my
case
like I joined this company and you know
like I said they're 10 years old they
went public um I they're like six or
seven years so unlike a lot of companies
Silicon Valley companies they actually
went the opposite instead of holding out
they like went public and when you go
public um there's a lot of constraints
that are put on you in different ways
you have put a lot of process in and I
really respect that they had the courage
to go do it and then you know we're a
SAS company and SAS companies got hit
pretty hard in like 22 23 when there was
this like profitability hit so they had
to like really change the business as
well and so kind of work towards
profitability which we just started
hitting and so I mean really talk about
adapting and go and watching your stock
price go up and then go down and and I
mean just so many things that in a short
period of time that I was sort of
referring to us as Doogie Hower and in
the sense I meant like we grew up really
quickly but we kind of skipped some some
growing up and think life experiences
you probably would have had as a
teenager that you didn't really go
through that we kind of need to go back
and do and in some ways we like
overdeveloped and we had a lot of like
process and policies and things that I
just were like this does not make any
sense and so I had been there maybe a
month when I was just talking to our CEO
and I was like there's just too much
 here like I just 10 hours of
training as a new hire there are like
nine steps to get something done in work
day like just so many things that I was
like I get I've worked at lots of public
companies I've been the chief people
officer it doesn't have to be this hard
and so and he was like yeah I kind of
think that too but he's never run he's
he's founder CEO he's never done it
before and he's just been like well this
is what I've told I have to do and I'm
like uhuhuh it doesn't have to be this
way it doesn't have to be this hard and
so we established a companywide okr I
was four weeks in on removing the
 and we set up just a Google
sheet and you can even put your name on
it or you could do it anonymously and we
set a goal for remove finding and
removing a hundred forms of in
the company and we just started going
after it I mean and then we found we
called it like the hunger gains a
tribute in every you know executive team
memb group and as submissions we' track
all the submissions and as those things
came in we would just like go after them
and some of them were really small
little things like around t&amp; and how you
like submitted expense reports and
making people's lives easier some of
them were much bigger like meeting
Audits and like in the engineering team
I think we ended up saving like four
hours of meetings per week for all
engineers and like seven hours of
meetings just for engineering leadership
like things like that or like changing
password policies or we got rid of there
was that like 10 hour of training as a
new hire we cut that down to six hours
of training so getting I mean this is
like substantial if you multiply it down
to the number and then there were just
like some really stupid rules that made
no sense at all um and then you have to
worry about like do some of these teams
feel attacked because you're like going
after their and a lot of them were in HR
mean they were in my own world and how
things were set up so then you got to
think about how do we Broach this and
some things were just like lack of
context like people didn't understand
why we did things and so I just every
week go to the ask eaff Channel and say
like this is the BS of the week that
we're going to talk about someone said
we should get rid of manager training so
I was like hey here's why we do manager
training even if you've been a manager
before this is but we could take a look
at some of the content and then you know
we saw there's some abuse on the other
hands when someone doesn't like
something at the company a decision that
they're made they were like we should
this is we shouldn't do this
anymore so now we have to like correct
the other way but it's still a goal it's
still an okr for the whole company now
this quarter it's fine 30 things because
we are just like this should not be a
onetime thing like we should constantly
be pushing on oursel but like that was
one you know fresh eyes coming in and
just saying like it doesn't have to be
this way and not being afraid to say
that and then looking for ways to do it
you know and and how much better does
someone like I like it when HR now some
people did submit feedback that they
didn't like the fact that I used the
word
 um in the All Hands meeting
because it's aot company and I guess
their kids were in the room or whatever
and of course you can imagine I did not
say this but you can imagine what I was
thinking when I heard that I'm like put
head headphones on or you're like at
work but okay um point point point taken
um I think two two things Colin you said
that I think were are really important
um because I you know I I coach some
heads of people and or or the those that
want to do this job God forbid they want
to get into this J we sign up to do it
yeah and they they feel daunted like I
got to go in there and do some big thing
quick wins does not mean you have to
like turn the table upside down it could
be cutting changing a TNA policy like
something that is that is motioning that
you low hanging fruit that you are
paying attention and that you're a human
and you can understand so I think that's
that's one and the second is you said is
so important because this is where it
could be
dangerous is not on the people
the work that came before you um so I
just want to make sure people don't take
I'm going to go in there like Colleen
and put on my Superwoman Kate and say
everything sucks like no one likes a
know at all so it's a balanced spe I
guess some people do but I it's a
balance
between those things and that's very
nuanced well and Kelly right like
Colleen didn't know what happened
beforehand to lead up to these things
maybe it made sense
at a time right this is like the analogy
I want to use which col is going to hate
is like col this is like Colleen's
version of Doge like no I hated that
only because I did this before Doge and
then Doge came out and I was like no I
don't want to be associated with that
but anyways but the the point is is that
like you don't know what had happened up
to this point maybe there were very good
reasons right that these things had
existed but now it no longer makes sense
and it's important to look at things
with fresh eyes and you know the other
thing too is like I'm sure with your
team to try and teach them not to have
sunk cost like just because we did this
thing and we've been doing this thing
doesn't mean we should be doing this
thing moving forward yes all the time
constantly and actually in this case I
sort of appreciate what happened is like
the likelihood of what happened was is
they had built something or had some
sort of training and then somebody said
oh we have to do this other training and
instead of going back and editing the
first training they just sort of add it
on and add no one ever no one ever
stopped time to say like don't we
already do this or do we have some other
flavor of this or don't we isn't this
covered or maybe they were buried and
didn't have time or they have enough
people or like people you have like four
people and this is all you can do and
you like do your best and it's like I'm
not making any assumption as to why I'm
just saying like we could be better you
know and I look at myself and I'm like
and it's like doing a retro every time
you do a new process so you know the
other thing Kelly you mentioned sort of
like being human was like that was one
of the goals I wanted to do too we're
remote company it's actually really hard
yeah to build community like I actually
think you're you when you talked about
the Jamie Diamond thing in the remote
work like it's actually very hard to
build community and and it is actually a
lot harder to onboard and one of the
things you all kind of touched on that I
am really grappling with right now is
the fact that like yeah sure every body
was able to work remotely in covid most
of the time because you already had
pre-established relationships with
people and then you just took them in
and that's why there was so much
attrition for people who were like
joining companies remotely immediately
like they just didn't know what to do or
how to do it and so if you want to be a
great remote company you got to set
yourself up for that and actually like
this company we are remote first we got
people all over the place and we're
still not great at that so one of the
things I had to point out was like we
have nobody whose whole job it is is to
focus on this thing now I have somebody
starting next week who that is going to
be their job but the amount of time we
talk about it where I'm like how is it
that this is like Central to who we are
and no one owns this yeah like those
kinds of observations of like someone's
job should be how do we create a an
amazing remote experience for everyone
yeah 3100 people kind of everywhere all
the time and they sort of understand
like like how how do you how do you
really do because honestly there aren't
a lot of great blueprints as much as
we've had pieces and parts and there are
a couple of companies here and a couple
of companies there but anybody who says
like oh I did it in Co I'm like yeah not
the same not the same totally and I
don't know about you both You can
disagree this will be great I'm just
going to throw the fodder out you know
but I don't believe there will be remote
companies like five years from now
without incredible blueprints on how to
get people together in the right way at
the right time I'm not talking about
everyone I'm talking about a very
complex schedule of humans or teams or
cross functional teams at the right
moments moments that matter for those of
you who were at pendo I invented moms
moments that matter um that's going to
be a big blueprint and I think you said
it it's kind of like making tenure with
someone if I've hung out with you for a
while and I get you and I have that you
know Nolan and I we don't need to be in
person for a long long time and it's
okay but if like I didn't know him
before this and just met him oh yeah
it's just hard I didn't know him before
this for a long time and I was like who
is that yeah totally I I still
say that still say that except for who
is this but I think a big it's with love
we're you know we're brother and sister
I think um a big part of the blueprint
is going to be how do you work remote
and get people together when it matters
yeah yeah but I do think the humanity
side of these things and I as much as I
have that other reputation like I do
care a lot like and it it is important
to me that people know that and even to
the note of like when I first was
joining there were a lot of the big
climate disasters in the United States
and in Spain and those kinds of things
and I remember saying to somebody on my
team like hey I want to send a note to
all the employees who are in the zip
codes where are being affected and this
employe and my team was like oh we don't
do that here and I was like we do today
we do now like we do now you know like
we do today and I don't care that it's
Saturday like you go find the list and I
started updating every exec team like
this is how many people we have this is
how many is affected here's the template
that each you know HR person is going to
go send to the people and this you know
I sent a note personally then we
followed up then we knew who was
affected we knew how they were affected
and then we found we had holes in the
system we had hourly employees but we
didn't have a process for them to get
paid when they had to take off leave
because their house had been completely
flooded like it was just a gap in the
system if you're so used to having you
know salaried workers with the kind of
unlimited take you know take your own
vacation but you have hourly workers who
don't fall into that bucket and they
they have no home what do you do for
those people like then you got to fix
fix the problem right away like those
those kinds of moments in life that
you're like crap um those you know which
maybe all everybody listening are like
of course HR lady of course we all do
those kinds of things but I was working
somewhere no that wasn't the thing yeah
you know and I was like no we do that
now we do that all of the time we do it
you know we we make sure that everybody
is aware I keep the leadership team
aware and they were so happy to finally
have like the update who how many of my
people are involved I don't I no one was
doing that like those kinds those things
matter
too you do better than it go ahead yeah
I was gonna say then by the way the
other thing is like the other big thing
on the list was no one understood at
this company how they were paid you know
what we just did we just Che change
compensation for everybody because if
you don't understand how you're paid
that's a big problem at a company I
don't care how missionary you are like
we're GNA fix that how how long how long
have you been there um I'll hit six
months in a couple weeks okay yeah so K
Kelly has a an existing appointment so
she's going to jump in a second but like
I like I got to jump into some of this
stuff Colleen so like the thing I think
you do better than anybody is continuous
Improvement
and you're not attached to perfect like
what you're describing right now is like
oh we just like did this thing and then
like oh we fell in like a bunch of
other things and then we like made that
thing better and we just like keep
making it better which I think is
exhibit a for how anybody should operate
but especially a new exec because it
shows humility it shows that like you're
not going to have the perfect solution
but that you're in constant you're in
constant working for a better company
and like a better culture like you're
just going to keep doing those things
the the second thing is you did these
one ons so like my my eyes bleed like
when I hear that and I'm like oh my God
like that sounds awful but then you said
you created this this six-page document
which I want to ask about in a second
and then you've been talking about the
what you've been hearing kind of like as
the narratives in the company so the
six-page document did you sell it did
you share it only with the executive
team or with the company yeah the six P
docent I only shared it with the
executive team and then the compensation
committee which is kind of like the
people committee from the board got um
yeah yeah but I talk about I think I've
mentioned all of the themes that I found
only because I pulled literal quotes um
I did I had did two versions people
might laugh at this this is a good use
of AI where I used my iPad so I was
making the intentional switch where I
used I used to always handwrite the
whole time um I made an intentional
switch to using my IP had and
handwriting the whole time which I then
converted to text and then have ai
translate and then pull out the themes
itself and tell me what my notes said
versus versus what I thought I said now
thankfully they did sort of align but I
just wanted to
see what chat gbt would say versus what
I was here you could trust it yeah yeah
yeah it was just kind of it's hard
because you're like notes yeah but your
notes are not exactly the same but you
could at least do like kind of wordcloud
and stuff like that um so it it's kind
of a fun and it was forcing me to get
used to a new mobility and to use chat
GPT in a different way and and those
kinds of things so was kind of a fun
exercise um but I I literally pulled
quotes from all of those one-on ones as
like kind of supporting documentation
and I just didn't think that those
quotes were you know like I kind of
didn't want people everybody to read all
it um yeah and not really designed for
that I just felt like someone should get
a summary but I would I would reference
that in my all of my all all hands are
sort of when I would hear a question or
something I'd say hey you know you have
a bunch of peers or we would reference
survey data for something and I would
say yeah and I've got I've heard that
from a number of you in these one-on
ones I've been doing from across a
company um I haven't stopped doing
one-on ones like I did the first 200 and
then now the one-on ones I'm trying to
get through my whole 150 people in my
organization so I got to get to all of
them um and I actually still interview
every single person who's interviewing
to be part of my organization so whether
or not yes obviously the workplace team
or recruiting or what I don't care where
you are if you're coming into the people
organization you still have to interview
with the chief people officer it doesn't
matter if you're in India or Singapore
or UK or the US like you have to
interview with me yeah um I have to
Accent these one-on ones before I jump
and know you you will keep going but
I've done this and every company I've
joined since GitHub in 20 late 2013 and
if it's below 300 people it's everyone
and if it's above like 300 350 it's like
you said chunks samplings but the goal
is to meet with everyone and there's
multiple reasons for that but I think
what I would just want to leave everyone
with is the best thing you can do is
what Colleen's saying is to go in with
transparency no one expects you to be
perfect no one expects you to but what
you can do do is tell them what you're
doing when you're doing it why you're
doing it and most importantly what the
output is um even if they don't like the
answer they will rally around you and I
aen it to like if you're going down this
long trail full of like weeds and bushes
and Thorns you can like fight that trail
with a machete every day and just like H
or what you just did and what what I'm
talking about it's literally like taking
a tractor through the whole thing and
clear clearing it out so that you can
like go through it easier because it
just makes the job so much easier and
people rally around you you can like
like move more freely it's it's so
important and by the way Secret Sauce
you guys can agree or disagree boards
love it boards are like what you met
with 400 500 people and you have no one
can argue no like I tell people all the
time the the dirty secret is Founders
boards no one can argue with what people
say right like yeah my wife they can
decide not to like it but my wife
because you can't tell me how to feel
yeah yeah and last thing we should say
is that here's where you should use your
network I have someone on my board that
Kelly also has had as a board member and
we've had a nice little set of therapy
together just through text with that we
have yes I texted you and you were like
oh yeah that person knows everything all
of the time or thinks he knows
everything all of the time back to
networks back to Networks
um Colleen like it's I want to have you
back on to talk about the comp stuff
because like that's probably a bigger
discussion but just for people like to
like break this down is like Colleen
starts you know what does she do she
goes on a listening tour but she's like
also getting quick wins in parallel then
she's like collating all of the
learnings from the listening tour
factoring that in coming the the the
 okr that's all time Colleen
like that's like so good like I can't
like people got to love that right so
like figuring out like a really big win
that people will love early right and
look I mean it's hard as a new hire in
general I think it's so hard as a new
exec especially at a company of 3,000
people because you have to manufacture
trust and I think what you're doing
right now is you're giving us you're
giving us the algorithm for how to do it
yeah I'm trying I mean you know you're
still you still have to deliver every
day on all of the other pieces which is
the other thing right
like recruiting has to work comp has to
work benefits have to work like I I was
very lucky in that there were a lot of
great people already there so I didn't
have to I wasn't swapping out a lot of
people like that was the nice part which
is I think a lot easier a lot of cheap
people officers do not have that good
fortune of having a good team in place
and so but you have to be doing that too
assess the team that you have what do
you have and then remember when you're
on that management team you're also
assessing the rest of the leadership
team and having to be that person for
the CEO and you're start you have to
establish that relationship and that
Cadence and how you you two figure that
stuff out and how do you become that
person with your peers um and establish
those re establish all of those
relationships and then start to form
opinions about their organization so you
know it's a lot I feel for people when
they're coming in in that way and yeah
this is a lot of um these are a lot of
hard-earned lessons of having done it a
bunch of times right so you know it's a
little bit of good fortune of
experience um and and now I'm just
better at it and but this is my first
time coming into a public company so
this was a big you know adventure for me
and maybe you know one of of the reason
you know and it was one of the reasons
like I don't know was like a bit of a
challenge like i' never done it before
could I do it would I wantan to you know
like a little you know I'm definitely
one of those people of like I can do it
I think I can do it so but I need a
little bit of a Fear Factor yeah so yeah
don't we all so I should you know we
want everybody to know like it was new
this part was new I had been in this
role at public companies and and you
know one of them was slightly even
bigger but I had grown that company I
had been there from a hundred people I
knew everybody because I was part of it
but going in later is much harder and I
wanted to see what that was like so here
I am totally figuring all right well
we're going to have you back in a couple
weeks is uh because I want to have this
comp conversation um oh yeah touching
comp in the first six months feels like
uh you know you're really getting next
to religion um so I'm excited to have
that conversation mine thanks for taking
us to school as always yeah thanks for
having me on it was really fun HR
