all right hey everybody Welcome Back To
HR Heretics today we have yope
vandervort who is the CEO and founder of
remote prior to remote he was the VP of
product at gitlab my joke is that he is
the king of remote and just some stats
on remote which is just absolutely
incredible founded in 2019 you now have
more than 1,500 employees across 70 plus
countries tens of thousands of customers
a$3 billion valuation and you've raised
over 500 million in VC funding yope it's
awesome to have you on the show happy to
be here thanks so much for being here so
I want to get into running a remote
company obviously this is like what your
product does but you have been doing
this for a long time I think gitlab is
maybe the best in the world at running
remote companies and now you're doing it
yourself and helping enable everyone
else to do it what do you see as the
things that companies get wrong as it
relates to remote I mean I I don't think
we know what what is Right which is a
weird thing to say but like there's not
a lot of shared understanding or even
shared experience of remote working at
all let alone running in a larger
organization right that is distributed
it all over many different countries and
or many people are working remotely and
so I it's very hard to say if anybody is
getting anything like particularly well
but I think there's a few things that
are really obviously wrong and I think
the first and most obvious one is well
if you are trying to replicate what you
did in an office in a remote setting you
will
fail and I I think that is mostly
because the way that we act in offices
is really outdated and it doesn't match
the current reality but it's very easy
and so what I mean with that is that I
think we manage a lot based on whether
you see people you know buts in seats
and we know rationally that that's not a
really good way to manage you should
manage on output is somebody actually
doing a good job but I but we didn't
have to learn that because if you do
walk into an office you you can sort of
judge people by whether they are sitting
in the seat right and so in a remote
organization obviously that doesn't work
and so you see all these tools coming
you know into reality that are helping
to attract people to see are they being
active are they moving their Mouse right
and and so that's a really really
obvious one which is that that's not the
right way to do it you should actually
like set clear expectations for what is
the kind of work that you expect people
to deliver and then look at that work
and then if they are not there you coach
them to get better Etc and the other
very big one is of course making people
sit in meetings all day I think sitting
in meetings is something that most
people don't really enjoy let alone many
hours at end but I think in an setting
where it is a zoom meeting it's even
worse than sitting in a meeting room
because you get what one you're always
staring at yourself right you always see
your own little square and so that you
know many people get very fatigued by
that but then there's just also the
thing that it just it feels very inhuman
to look at a screen all the time right e
much more so than sitting in a meeting
room where there's more natural breaks
Etc and beyond that it's just not
necessary and I think you feel that
double when you have access to
distractions be that on your computer
outside of your computer where you can
do your mail at the same time and
everybody ends up doing this everybody's
doing their mail while they're in Zoom
meeting so why are you in this meeting
in the first place which is actually you
know my point which is you probably
don't need to have this many meetings
whether you are in an office or working
remotely you don't need to have a lot of
meetings and in fact I would say
meetings are a great tool when you use
them appropriately but for the most part
they're extremely heavily overused and
so that's a pretty big one too many
meetings that's a really big one but
ultimately I don't think there's like a
great you know standard on remote work
so you know when we ran gitlab we
created this handbook that this open so
that other people could learn from it
and we do the same at remote and what we
find is that and it's quite
intentionally so is that there's a lot
of similarities but there's also a lot
of differences between the two companies
part of it had to do with you know the
personality of sit the CEO of gitlab and
the personality of me running remote but
also part of it has to do with tools as
they evolved right we use notion very
heavily at remote we didn't have that at
gitlab so we had to sort of build our
own solution for that but also we decide
to do things in a different way and we
found that at even though we do things
very differently in some ways at remote
it still works and so to say is remote
or gitlab doing one thing or the other
better or worse even though they're
completely differently you know we don't
really know and so that that to me is
like the the real interesting bit is
that for the most part we don't know and
you basically have to go in and like
treat the building and running of the
organization as a product so something
that you evaluate where you look at like
what are the problems that I'm facing
and like can we iterate to towards a
state where we believe it this better
right and as your company grows the
problems will change as well once your
company gets really really big just like
office-based companies the the problems
in some ways get easier to solve because
you know really big companies are so big
they have to think about how do we
communicate across departments across
buildings across different countries and
so your companies are to follow into
those buckets but it's the middle part
that's really difficult where you're not
super big yet but you are highly
distributed and that's a very unique
place to be as an as a remote and
distributed company I think that's sort
of where remote has been you know 1500
employees is big but it's not like
multinational giant Corporation big
right and so I don't know I think that's
a
bunch of things it's such a big topic
obviously right now and for the past
couple years and so many different
opinions and I completely agree with you
that I think a lot of companies have
tried to replicate the office experience
remotely I totally agree with that and I
guess my question for you is besides
like bless meetings yope what are the
one or two things that you all have
explicitly done that is not replicating
that very explicitly that might not be
as obvious or that other folks don't
really do that even have remote cultures
so what are things that we yeah like
there any like very very explicit rules
policies beliefs that you all practice
to make this work that aren't very
common out there yeah I you know I I
think not having meetings is part of the
greater wave of saying well we work
asynchronous first and I do think that
that is you know mostly how gitlab
worked as well and works
but it sort of says that you should
always be able to do work and work
independently and a really large part of
that means that you write stuff down so
that people don't have to ask you for it
you you know you make a good you do a
good job of documenting things but at at
remote I think we were much less
dogmatic than gitlab was in that in that
way and it still sort of worked out um
also we have I guess the fallback of
better tooling today
but above that I think the most
important thing was giving sufficient
ownership to people to really manage
themselves and
so nobody is being micromanaged in any
capacity and people are giving extreme
flexibility and extreme ownership over
their work and I think I think that's
the real big one because if you do that
people start to
self-organize both by themselves but
also in in teams so for example in
remote much of our product is build in
small teams and those small teams they
have like a general sense of ownership
so there's for example a team that is
responsible for uh identity management
right so access to apps and whatever
else but like that's all they know
that's their brief and the company has
particular goals and really really high
level goals but like that's their brief
it's like this is what you're
responsible for figure it out and then
within that they basically fully have to
figure it out and so they have full
flexibility to not just figure out what
are we working on but also Al how do we
work and how do we collaborate as a team
and so we are being zero prescriptive
about it and so what is interesting is
that for example we don't say well we
manage projects in a particular way or
we don't use particular edile
methodologies we if you want to you can
if that's something you want to do in
your team if you want to do a daily
stample up you can there's like three
out of the 50 or so teams that we have
do that if you want to get together
sometimes you can but you don't have to
if you want and so we give them extreme
extreme flexibility in that sense and
that's really interesting because it
solves a lot of problems like rather
than trying to find something that works
for everybody just let people figure
themselves out and uh that works really
really well and I I think we tend to
stay away from like predefined
Frameworks and scripts and you know
particular type of Scaffolding in which
we want everything to fit that as long
as you like reach your goals and you're
able to effectively communicate about
them and like operate in somewhat of a
transparent way so that if I come into
your team and you ask you what are you
working or you can answer me and you can
show me where I can find that answer
myself and we don't really care about
like how exactly do it and it means that
we can focus more on delivering rather
than on you know busy work like process
and Reporting y it's outputs it's
outputs instead of inputs and then yeah
the so so I want to talk about hiring
then because I think what you just said
is really interesting which is we don't
mic nobody is micromanaged
and if I go back to earlier in my career
I think a lot about what I learned from
osmosis just being in the office like
being around other people hearing like
what they're saying you know being in
conversations in the kitchen and just as
a listener you don't get that as much in
a remote culture and so do you guys
think
about the seniority of your hires do you
think about like you know you have to be
able to like be self-managed and we
don't hire new College grads for
example no I think the premise is not
true I think the osmosis know they
setting in the kitchen I think that's
like extremely limited right I think
your exposure is extremely limited and
and isolated to small occasion over a
really long period of time whereas if
you go in our slack you can read what
every single person is talking about in
every single team in a company and so
there's the opportunity to selfs serve
information and to learn by osmosis so
to say is far greater in our company
than it is I think in a typical office
workflow you just have to do it and like
there's a part of it which is like well
how do you make that discoverable but as
much as you didn't have to discover
where the kitchen was well you did on
your first day yeah we need to make sure
that we point people to well this is
where this team is working and this is
where this team is working but then if
you are interested or if you want to
learn something from a particular team
or expert or person then that is just
available to you at any point in time
however you want having said that it's
worth addressing it right if you want to
hire more Junior people you have to
provide the structure to be able to
educate them and to level them up Etc
and when we start out as a company we
actually we mostly hired Senior People
particularly so in engineering but it
was more out of the choice of not
wanting to spend the time to train
people right because I think training is
an active thing it's not a passive thing
yeah sure you can have somebody
passively learning on the job but I I
don't actually think that's particularly
effective and I think it's mostly a
waste of you know that person and a
money did you pay that person while
there and so at one point we made an
explicit decision where we said well we
are going to train people and in our
case so remote uses this programming
language called Elixir which is it's
popular in the sense that people really
like it but it's not popular in the
sense that there's a gazillion software
Engineers that actually are very
comfortable with it and so what we did
is we said well we know that there's a
finite supply of Elixir developers on
the planet but we need a whole lot of
them and we can probably exhaust the
world of Elixir Developers if we wanted
so we started to accept people that do
not have any experience in it and we are
going to teach them and we are going to
give them the tools and we are going to
Mentor them that was a decision and with
the decision comes the decision to say
well we may have to make sure that
managers don't have too many reports we
have to make sure that there's a
framework where you know somebody who's
new at this has a buddy and can learn
from
them and essentially that you know
committing to the fact that we want to
hire people that are more Junior and so
we did and it works fine because in the
end it's you know if you as long as you
can spend sufficient time with somebody
else that is what is leading not whether
you're in the same room or not now do
you want to put a very Junior person by
themselves 12 hours in time zone away
from everybody else no that's horrible
but you don't want to do that with
anybody right you want people to be
close together so that they can work
together and they can collaborate and
that the cycle time the time to make any
particular decision or answer a question
is is as short as possible and so in the
end if you really zoom out the thing I
was think to myself is like what is the
advantage about being able to see how
tall somebody is and be able to smell
them and it's very little and all the
other you can make up right you
can talk with each other and if you
really want you can put an audio call on
all day and actually there are some
people that do that they hang out in
audio rooms all day working together see
that's that's interesting that's kind of
what I was getting at is what do you do
that many companies who are even when
they claim they're fully remote might
not do and having a room that you can go
in all day and see and hear other people
that's interesting I've never heard of a
company doing that um yeah I mean it's
it's a feature in slack so you can you
know you can start a huddle and then you
can just join any but like it's not like
everybody in the company does that right
like there's a few people that like to
do that occasionally I think it's more
about like having access to these kind
of tools and having the awareness to be
able to use them than anything else
because for the most part what we find
is that if you give people a lot of
tools if you give them enough
information
then they'll just do their job
especially like Engineers who have to be
focused and and usually in quiet or at
least in their own comfort zone to do
exceptionally well they Thrive for the
fact that they can concentrate for long
periods of time yes I have one more
question on hiring and I can imagine
this is a wonderful environment for many
folks I can also imagine it's not a
great way of working or an enjoyable way
of working for some folks right I just
go back to what you said about you can
read on slack all day along everything
that's going on in the company and some
people that might make their head
explode how do you screen for that in
the hiring process and have you ever had
to kind of three months in say oh no
this isn't working has that happened a
lot just
curious hey I think you know you need to
be able to read and write well which is
a bigger hurdle than you might think
right but all that in that I think these
are things that you can coach people
into and so I always say the same thing
and I say this to people that are really
Junior to the company that are this is
their first job out of college but I
also say it's to you know see level
exacts and I even say to people that
have experienced working in remote
companies before is that just Bas
yourself where you enjoyed because
there's so much information and you need
to become very self-directed if you let
yourself be directed by notifications
and unread channels it's going to be
really hard because you cannot keep up
with continuous information flowing from
 
yourself what you're going to do and so
that ability you know to be the ability
to be independent and and self
organizing and such you can screen to a
certain degree when you're hiring right
you know you can ask for examples and
but for the most part I find that like
if you hire intelligent people who have
some Career Success or are really
ambitious or R driven they will be fine
and with a little bit of coaching they
will be fine yeah occasionally it
doesn't work out but I I think it goes
for any function right and it might not
be specific to do remote working in my
experience it doesn't happen very often
that we come across people that don't
work remotely particular well but in all
other ways check every single Mark
usually it's like well they don't
communicate well and if you don't
communicate well it's going to be hard
to thrive in any situation but that is
going to be more obvious in a remote
situation because if you don't
communicate well it's like you don't
exist hey everyone we'll be right back

[Music]
you so we're in a really interesting
time right now to where during covid
every company was forced to go remote
and now we're seeing a pullback in the
labor market and we're seeing a forced
return to office from many CEOs and the
general take is is like remote didn't
work for us we just saw Nike actually
just say the same thing like remote has
not worked for us at all we need people
we need butts and seats that's how we do
our best work I'm curious like what your
take is on those CEOs and and Venture
capitalists who are saying that the only
way to build a company is in person
yeah I don't know I you know I don't I
don't worry about it too much and the
reason that I don't worry about it is
because I I think the fundamental forces
that drive remote work and you know in
particular
International right hiring right which
is ultimately what my company is all
about is the need for great talent and
the need for great talent remains really
really high you know p in a labor market
doesn't refer to the entire labor market
but one thing that we see is that you
know the demand for like great Engineers
designers whatever else you know remains
greater than like the supply of them and
that's the problem that is solved almost
solved if you start hiring
internationally and for that reason we
continue to see companies more and more
hire internationally and yeah you can't
open an office anywhere the people are
and so and because people now know since
the pandemic that oh I can totally do my
work remotely they have the ability they
have the leverage to to demand it and
sufficient of them more than 50% of all
people actually prefer to do work where
they can work at least partially
remotely and so given those like
fundamental forces the only thing we see
luckily is that hiring internationally
and therefore remote work by itself is
increasing and so I understand that CEOs
that have done a job for 40 years and
two of them were remote in a really
crazy time of the world like they are
like for 40 years for you know 36 years
it went well and then for 2 years we did
it remotely and it didn't go
particularly well let's go put the back
yeah I can understand that I think the
change will take a really long time I
think it's almost like a generational
change yeah and I also think as I said
like if you can't fully embrace it it is
going to be very difficult so if you're
going to try to replicate what you had
before as in your style of working then
yeah it's going to be easy to go back to
the office and you'll just fall back
into what you did before which you know
clearly works for your company and also
you still have a lease to pay so you
know there's that angle as well all use
those offices that you had and so I I I
do really understand that it can be
really difficult for companies to like
meaningfully change the way that they
work and wanting to go back to the way
they did things because you know going
from one state to the other is going to
be very difficult and it's going to be
difficult for everybody involved not
just the executives but everybody else
as well because they knew that they were
working a particular way and if the
company doesn't help them working in a
different way yeah and yeah so yeah
totally understand it I still but like
fundamental forces dve drive us to have
have more and more remote work
regardless of that and so I think it's
just that the pandemic rushed a change
yeah and I think a rush change is not
necessarily a good thing even though it
it I mean it helped my company of course
yope I was in the head of people world
at GitHub at the same time you started
gitlab and we were I think across 35
States and 17 countries at that time I
think and same thing right very very
clear about documentation reading I mean
people wouldn't have conversations in
the hallway about work because not
everyone could see it so you'd put it on
the repo and you'd document it Etc so
everyone could participate but I did
find especially when it came down to
like
organizational people those types of
movements changes in the company it was
actually very hard there was a lot of
context missing people miss things they
read it wrong like how do you combat
that because that's different than four
Engineers shipping something like I had
a lot of trouble with that that much
distributed that much on paper or screen
yeah I think that's a great question I
think that is one of the things that we
at gitlab also got wrong or at least we
had to learn and I think that is
something that we meaningfully do
different at remote and then that is
specifically that the threshold to work
asynchronously to write and read and to
absorb information cannot be higher for
non-technical people than it is for
technical people like you cannot have an
company culture that is designed
specifically so that Engineers can do
the work really really easily and nobody
else does and that was at gitlab we
required people to make commits right
which is like sure we made a tool to do
it but it was like really hard I was
getting feedback on HR stuff via poll
requests so I think we're in the same
boat yeah and it's like it's really
myopic worldview to think that like
that's actually a great user experience
you know and like yeah I mean there's
cool things about it and like I would
love everybody to learn get but like
you're actually making things much
harder than they should be and so at
remote we solve it by two things right
one is we use a modern tool which didn't
exist we use notion which is really
really nice and we use other tools that
are like great to use it's also a little
bit my personal philosophy which is that
I don't think any tool should be hard to
use right I I that's how we buil our own
software as well it's like my belief is
that you know in our case we built
payroll software right so you should be
anybody should be able to run payroll
and not an accountant because I feel
like there's no reason that we don't
make it easy for people the only reason
that it's hard is because nobody took
the time to make it easy so that's one
we make the tools really easy to use and
then the second one is that instead of
going from the angle of like oh you have
to be incredibly strict about following
the protocols we have to create a way of
operating that is accessible right right
and that is uh inclusionary instead of
exclusionary so if you you can't expect
everybody to read all the things like
it's not realistic like and it's also
not like you're not in touch with
reality if you believe that everybody's
going to read the documentation always
no matter how many times you're going to
say it sometimes you just need to talk
to people and one of the things that
every manager learns or every leader
learns is that if you care about
something you have to repeat it a whole
bunch of times and so if your whole
company culture is predicated on the
fact that everything is written down and
if it's written down you know it right
because the first thing you're going to
do is like search things and and if
something's written down somewhere that
you have to read you're going to read it
I mean it's not in touch with reality
because that's not how people operate
you need tell people 700 times about the
thing that you really care about before
they start to get it and also it's just
really inconvenient right like you
become very process process driven
rather than this is actually what we
care about and so
yeah I that's it I I I think this is
like the biggest difference between
gitlab when I left you know which to be
clear is more than five years ago okay
it's a different company today but
gitlab when I left and and then when how
we started remote and how we thought
about like how do we communicate and
such been building this company for five
and a half years and I've not been
convinced that taking less of a dogmatic
approach around documentation and and
contributing to the documentation and
reading from the documentation I don't
think it has adversely affected REM mode
right and so I I think it mostly has
been positive that we tell people to
document things and to work
transparently but we're not like well if
you don't document it it's not true and
it doesn't happen and it always has to
be documentation first no it's it's fine
if you like sometimes say something or
like yeah you can speak just just speak
up before you write it down like I love
I love that yope and we sounds like we
were in the same boat back in 2014 with
that but it's very like responsible and
evolve View and I I appreciate that I
have one more question just based on you
know my experience I walked into GitHub
and I think again we were about 17
countries internationally and kind of
illegitimately if you will everyone was
contractors right they had been
contractors for two years and built
their lives around that right tax
loopholes I mean it was like cemented in
eight feet up right like don't change me
and it was like we had to unravel all of
that open up 17 entities I just want to
accent that saying you're in 87
countries sounds wonderful and
everyone's like wow it is a pain in the
ass and I just want to ask do you open
up these entities for everyone how do
you do that I mean what does that look
like as far as lift because that was
probably my least favorite project of my
career yeah it's our business right so
you know remote started out and is an
employer record so we open entities in
we have entities in more than 100
countries and yeah yeah we have to do
that ourselves and it's a lot of work
and actually you know for us we do it
because if you want to hire somebody in
any given country you hire them through
our entity right so you don't have to
set up your own entity but for us it
means that yes we go through the pain
and actually for remote the pain is like
you know at least twice as big because
we're not setting up a normal entity
right if at GitHub you had to open an
entity you said okay we're gonna open up
GitHub Australia so that we can hire
people that work for us there with
remote we have to open up remote
Australia taking into account that we're
going to employe
people instead of somebody else some
other third party company that comes to
us says I want to hire Jane and she
lives in Brisbane and now but I don't
have an entity there so I'm going to use
remote to hire her and remote's going to
be the liable employer but I am the
actual employer and remote is going to
wire her money but also if there's
employment conflicts it's gonna so and
we have to take all those things into
account and like figure out the way to
operate there and um so yeah it's a lot
of work but like there blood s in the
Earths that's the answer we just did it
and we keep going in it continue to do
it that's incredible that's incredible I
wish you know you were around back then
I love it it's it's so
complex it is there's there's other
complexities too with managing a a
global employee base one of them is
compensation and so I'm curious not only
for remote as a company but also remotes
customers is how are you guys thinking
about geography based compensation so at
CA we had offices I think it was in
three or four countries when I was there
and we did geography based compensation
and there's pros and cons how how are
you guys thinking about
it yeah I there's no alternative right
you're always going to end up uh with
that model and the reason is very simple
is like the labor market is a market and
so it's supply and demand and Supply
demand is localized and so we are trying
to change that with remote by making it
so easy to hire internationally that
like the labor market becomes a true
Global single Global Market but the
reality is that it's not and so you know
it's very easy to fall into the ethical
perspective but that's not that's not
reality right because we're not talking
about ethics we're talking about like
what are the Dynamics of a market and
they're very easy to explain I am a
company I have a set budget I have $100
to spend and with those $100 I can hire
I want to hire as many people there as
big of an impact as possible and I want
I want to hire great people but if I go
in San Francisco I can hire two people
because it Go $50 each if I go elsewhere
then depending on like what are the
local rates for for example developers I
might be able to hire 10 people in the
UK for that and so am I going to pay
those in the people in the UK $50 each
and only hire two of them because of
ethical perspective well my company's
going to grow slower and I just have
people that are wildly overcompensated
relative to the local market no of
course not I'm going to pay whatever is
locally competitive because that's what
will bring those people to my company if
I offer them $12 instead of 10 which is
the local rate they will join my company
they are happy and I am happy because
I'm still able to hire a whole bunch
more people right that's market dynamics
and so market dynamics will drive labor
and if you do anything in another
Direction you're going to get go against
the grain and it's going to have the
consequences that come with that right
so one approach is to say we're pay
everybody equally well then how much are
you going to pay people because if you
pay people everything San Francisco
which is like the top of the
market you can hire much fewer people
much much fewer and the people you will
attract will be people from literally
every place in the world because
everybody wants to be paid like that and
you're going to attract a lot of people
that I approach you only for the
salary you might say that's fine but
like as company is probably not a very
wise thing to do if you don't pay top of
the market then you cannot hire the best
person for the role and every company
says they want to hire the best person
from the role but you're basically
saying well well then we cannot hire
people in San Francisco okay so then
what is the Mex that you're going to set
and then okay so we're going to exclude
a large part of the world and so now
we're going to only be present in
particular markets this is actually a
very reasonable
approach but the same problem comes
again which is like okay but like as I
say I put a level at UK which is
slightly below San Francisco am I now
only going to hire in that market or am
also going to pay over significantly
overpay other Market you know and you
run into the same problem endlessly and
so at the end what you're going to do is
you're going to pay what the market says
and you're going to say well we're going
to relative to local markets pay a
certain percentile right we want to be
at a certain rate we want to be 50
percentile right if we want to straight
in the median or maybe we're going to be
a really well-paying employer we're
going to be in 8 percentile in any given
market then you have a good approach
because for anybody in any given Market
you pay great salary and as a business
you get the benefit of saying well we
want to hire the best person we're going
to hire regardless of geography or maybe
up to a certain cap but we also get the
savings so to say of hiring people from
all over the world and we still pay them
well because we literally pay more than
 
paying 80% now and so that's where
you're is going to run into any
alternative path you're going to run
into that because at scale it doesn't
work to have these like ethics based
compensation policies the only thing you
can go against this like longterm to
like solve this in compensation
inequality is to start a company that
makes it easier to hire people
internationally because if you do that
really really well and that company
becomes wildly successful what you see
and I can tell you from data that I have
that salaries in exceptionally low low
celerate locations so for example I used
to live in the North of Portugal they
start to rise because companies start
hiring people there and the people that
could hire there they tell their friends
you don't have to work for ,000 EUR a
month you can earn a 4,000 EUR a month
which is approximately what happened in
the north of Portugal with celeries the
local software Engineers went from, to
 
EUR on the average 5,000 is about yeah
five $6,000 pretty shitty salary for San
Francisco but it's fantastic for North
Portugal and so who's complaining this
situation nobody people on the internet
on Twitter but other than that
nobody so okay that's why I agree with
you that when you are hiring globally
you have to think about location based
compensation I think the challenge is
once people are in the company and then
you're thinking about internal Equity so
engineer in San Francisco versus
engineer in Rio and we're looking at
performance an engineer in Rio has
higher performance than engineer in San
Francisco yep and so in your mind what
you're saying is yeah like that's just
the reality of global hiring and Global
employee management is such that the
even though the engineer in San
Francisco is a lower performer than
engineer in Rio the engineer in San
Francisco makes more money
yeah that's how it works start start
with the comp first right stay true to
that and then manage how would you
reward the other engineer over the SF
engineer yope would you I mean Equity is
anything else come into play besides
pay yeah you can't dis discriminate in
other ways right so everybody has you
know you should have leveling you have
levels you have B accelerate band and if
somebody performs well they should grow
in their bands or they should go up in
levels and those levels they are
corrected to local pay and that's the
reality of it and in the moment that
local pay gets up to a certain level or
a person is so exceptional in a role
that they can demand Global pricing
which is probably like a long term if
you get like the top 1% of the market
then maybe that changes things but for
the most part that's just not the
reality right and and like as an
employer you should separate the two
things you should manage performance you
should
you know have a great compensation
framework and structure but if you are
going to do this at every stage that's
not really fun for anybody involved
right and like it's not productive
either then we're it's not worth having
that discussion you should just actively
manage performance period and then you
can follow the same routine every single
time like do you want to then just fire
everybody in San Francisco only hire
people in Brazil or wherever else and
then performance level those people it
it it gets you nothing that kind of
discussion it's a really interesting
take um and I think it it plays in
theory up until the Brazilian engineer
puts a notice and like this is how it
always works is right we we always think
about location based competition and we
we set the mark until like the competing
offer comes in and I have a lot of
friends right now who are hiring
aggressively in India also in Brazil and
those markets we're seeing like the data
isn't keeping up with how fast those
markets are
moving and there's like now people are
coming into the table with like hey I
just got this new offer and so actually
tell us what you're seeing in the data
as it relates to like how fast are those
Emerging Markets compensation
Rising yeah that's a great one so we
have a compensation benchmarking tool in
remote and we know this is this is
really valuable because ours is life
data rather than data from months ago
because we throw it out like it's active
it's what people are earning today and
not what they used to earn and now you
know the data becom stale and like it's
really hard to pin
because countries are big and these
distributions are not direct right and
so what happens is that the ranges of
compensations within any given role
within a particular region or country
expand where indeed like the top 1%
might far exceed everybody else right
which is
yeah it's you know we we show you the
quartiles right like in um one of those
airboxes and like we do that because
then you get an idea of like where does
happen but over time of course the
median shifts right and that's is
explicitly our purpose and so as a
company you just have to be reactive to
this right and so if you do see that you
know and you have to be honest about it
you will have to adjust over time your
compensation bands in particularly in
lower markets and like there's a few
tricks you can do right you can say well
we're not going to pay under a certain
level or we're going to like pay
everybody at least a certain percent
like you know you say well we do a local
pay but you know like we we adjust it
upwards in the lower end of it and like
you can do all sorts of creative things
where essentially you are contributing
to slightly overpaying people locally
but also to give you margin to like
prevent these kind of cases
because again it's a market and you you
don't have to win or lose the market you
have to just be you know go along with
it and be rational about it and you also
have to be rational about the fact that
yeah if you have a high
performer and the market says High
performer should be paid more you should
adjust to that reality
right that that's it it's just if the
Market's moving fast you have no choice
but it's a great luxury for everybody
involved that we can do this right now
right and I much rather have a world
where everybody gets paid equally but
like rent is not equal everywhere either
and for its worth the top percentage of
talent will always remain the top you
know you because of statistic will
always remain the top percentage of
talent and so it's not like naturally
it's going to change so that everybody
suddenly Falls in that you know not
everybody in Brazil is going to be paid
like in San Francisco because the market
dynamics are against that because the
rent prices don't follow that and rest
of population is also not at that level
right you know we're getting into like
really macroeconomics but you know you
you can think of it in in that sense you
cannot forever adjust and as a company
you have to continue to be rational and
you can also not create a compensation
framework which is super crazy and like
super broad because then nobody can make
sense of anything anymore they get
income disparity between people in same
country in the same Ro and you don't
want it either yope what is your take on
Mobility either advice you give to
customers or at remote with employees
moving around I want to move to Portugal
from San Francisco what do you do with
me if
anything yeah I mean for us mobility is
huge in in all sorts of ways you know
you said mobility and I got triggered
because we have a large team called
mobility and the team is responsible for
visa and immigration and work permits
Etc geographical Mobility yeah do that
yeah well actually I mean it's the
source of of all you know that that
causes us to need that's true that's
true I'll start with an anecdote so I do
once every month or so I do a welcome
call where we bring in all the new
people that have joined the company we
talk and they ask me whatever questions
they want and it was so nice I did one
this morning and almost every person on
the call were like 40 people almost
every person on that call was a certain
nationality but lived in a completely
different country I think almost without
exception and I I think that's really
really nice and it's like one of the
perks of like the job and like the kind
of people you attract as
well so there's a few ways to think
about it I think it's tough and like
there's not a true solution to it I
think generally what you um the way to
treat it and also if you want to do
things compliantly somebody's employed
in a country right and so this is our
role as an employer record and so we do
this well appropriately as well is
somebody's employed in a particular
country so they actually need to live in
that country and be in that country for
I think at least you know 181 or 182
days something like
that and so that is our assumption if
somebody moves to a different country
they need a new contract and like the
fairest way to think about is to say
well if you want that we will have to
give you a new offer and that is
something that we can discuss we can
decide to not give you a new offer if
you decide to move to another country
and the way we have done it internally
at remote but also generally I think it
works really well is that you have clear
guidelines about this where you say like
well in certain situation we will offer
it if performance is good but generally
it's not it's not a given because the
system would be very easy to abuse right
because you would say you would apply
from a low cost country and it would
move to high cost country yeah right or
worse you would yes apply from a high
cost country get a really high salary
move to a low cost country and now you
create this massive Inc disparity so
that's really really really difficult
and so it's important you set really
clear guidelines before you encounter
these kind of cases and just demand that
everybody's transparent and honest about
these kind of things so for example
asking in advance are you planning to
move within the next period so I have
this really great higher reporting to me
and he told us I am going to move from
one country and one side of the plan to
the other side of the country and then
we accounted for it we said look okay
this is what's going to happen right
this is what's going to happen to your
compensation do you agree with that
because we're going to pay you more now
and less later because your cost is
going to be much lower and if we set you
in that market then your compensation
would be way out of demand we have said
do you agree with that and he said yes I
agree with that and so we agreed upon
that and that was it and so that's sort
of how to do it but it is not easy and
like another good thing to do for
example or like is to have policies
around do I allow people to actually
move out within the first year of
employment right because you're creating
a huge headache for the company but
you're also creating all sorts of
interesting complicated labor law
situations where you know somebody
might gain more rights to unemployment
you know if they let go they get paid
more in some situation like it is
actually really really complex and so
the best course of action is to create
clear guidelines and if you don't have
them you know our team can help of
course with that but um being really
clear about that but generally like
people have to be adults and if somebody
tries to scam you out of money in these
kind of tricks they are not a good
employee period so like there also
really good I'm sure there are other
things going on as well
yeah like you you don't want to work
with people that are actively trying to
scam you out of money but there are
going to be many edge cases where you
have to figure it out because somebody
is working for the company for 10 months
didn't expect to have to move they are a
high performer you're like well you know
normally wouldn't do this but they're
high performer so I wonder where it you
know it works out on the edge cases yeah
so I I just want to cap this question
conversation so many HR folks I've
talked to struggle we're trying to
create rules around this and this and
that and you said something yope that I
had not heard before and I think it's a
really great way to to think about this
and change the mindset of the employee
is we will issue you a new offer and in
that it could be a no offer decision I
had never heard it that way it was just
assumed I'm moving I get this or this or
this and we talk a lot about marketing
right Nolan in different episodes and
packaging and semantics and that phrase
I think it's so helpful to use off the
bat and I think it just sets
expectations just by saying
that yeah we did the same ex G laab so
you know it was the same policy
um I it is useful for everybody involved
and I I think it is just fair it sets
expectation incredibly clearly I think
one interesting angle is that this is a
very different angle but you know a see
all these function reporting to if you
doing finance and you're planning for
hat count one thing that we started to
do is planned for headcount period so
like the average cost of head count or
like median cost instead of planning for
uh specific cost of Any Given hire and
if you do that then that decision
doesn't become a financial decision
because if somebody moves within the
bands like long term it will not have a
large impact on your financial plan
right unless literally the whole company
moves from you know one place to the
most expensive but that won't happen
right statistically that won't happen
and so you know you want to take away
the need for you to evaluate people and
to see them purely as like a a a cost
yeah you know this is just a like this
is just like one row of cost you know in
our sheet and like how are we're going
to adjust it and like what is there you
don't want to do that you want to take
that away um but you do want to have the
freedom to say look you're breaking your
contract you're literally quitting from
this company in this country we as an
employer are not happy about your
performance for us that's a you know
sounds harsh but like for us we we don't
want to continue we don't want to like
commit to paying you yet another year
basically guaranteed in certain markets
of salary just because you decided to
move right then there's massive
imbalancing power yeah so simple and so
clean and impactful I love that yeah
also the world is the world is messy and
I I appreciate your your cander and
transparency for how to to deal with
these complex
topics y last question for me is around
just the the hiring market so there's
been about 500,000 Tech employees who
have lost their jobs since
 
global hiring market and what's going on
there yeah it's funny right because we
are in biased because we mostly see our
company grows for many reasons not just
because markets are growing and so from
our perspective the the market is
growing as a whole and we do see that
there's a lot of companies that have
died which is why a lot of people lost
their jobs but also because like you
know a large tech company fired the
gazillion people and those people also
got new jobs and many of them got new
jobs globally but what we see is kind of
boring which is that large economies
hire more people and continue to do so
and there are some Trends in how many
people are being hired and with which
rate and I I remember in the first wave
of layoffs hit which I think was
 
Hemisphere I should say that it's not
same for
everybody we saw like a wave of of
layoffs and I think this was like you
know following the layoffs like some of
the big tech companies some startups
take that opportunity they think there's
like a macroeconomic shift and so they
sort of band wanging along right and and
we saw that a few times happening over
the past years in 2022 in
particular recently we haven't really
seen that we haven't seen waves right
there's been news and sometimes there's
interesting news but we have not
actually seen that correlate to like
waves of layoffs and hiring itself
continues to grow right but I I think
our view is very biased because our
company is growing is getting more well
known and generally I think more
companies are hiring internationally
more and more over time as well we do
see accelerations in hiring so we see
that happening in waves as like people
become more optimistic as you know if we
seees funding starts to pick up or
particular categories like you know we
have a number of companies that are AI
companies you can imagine how they hire
but for the most part we see like
reasonable optimism not as much as like
like shortly after the pandemic when you
know remote working remote hiring shut
up through the sky but in absolute
numbers for us it's much bigger than it
was then because we are a bigger company
would you say that companies
specifically in the United States or
sorry employees specifically in the
United States should be concerned about
wage growth given that they now have to
compete on a global scale no I don't
think so I think you know again labor
market works as a market right and I
think if you have something that is
valuable the market will always reward
it I don't think that you are competing
with more people that's true but I don't
think as an individual you should not
worry about like macroeconomic activity
impacting your personal situation I
think you should make sure you do work
that fulfills you and if you do it
really well you will always find a job
that pays well Rel to where you live
that said I do think that even just
saying like the US is kind of like
you're shortcutting a lot large part of
the world right because the the reality
for the east and west coast is very
different from the literally the rest of
the US right like true it's like if you
live in San Francisco or New York your
expectation but also the need for you to
earn really really high is very
different than almost any other place in
the US with the exception of maybe I
don't know you know if you go all the
way to Seattle or to Austin or something
and so so um no but like I do think that
your potential of earning more if you
are not near a metropolitan area or
particular on either of the coasts is
far greater than it's ever been if you
work in Tech or if you are knowledge
worker right and you start working from
home and so I think that that potential
is far greater and so you know you
translate in like normal human activity
if you want to live in a bigger house
you don't care about living in a city
the best time is now you can just like
big buy a big house somewhere where it's
cheap and live a great life and that is
easier than it's ever been for people in
the US for people outside of the US and
virtually everywhere else and if you do
want to live in the city then that's
also totally possible and there's still
a whole bunch of companies that still
have offices there they will have no
choice but to pay local salaries even if
other global companies might might not
feel the need to yep yeah life is about
trade-offs
 
yo thanks so much for the time this was
incredible this was great yope thank you
