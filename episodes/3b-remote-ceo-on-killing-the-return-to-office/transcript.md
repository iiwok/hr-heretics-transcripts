it all over many different countries and
it all over many different countries and
 
it all over many different countries and
or many people are working remotely and
or many people are working remotely and
 
or many people are working remotely and
so I it's very hard to say if anybody is
so I it's very hard to say if anybody is
 
so I it's very hard to say if anybody is
getting anything like particularly well
getting anything like particularly well
 
getting anything like particularly well
but I think there's a few things that
but I think there's a few things that
 
but I think there's a few things that
are really obviously wrong and I think
are really obviously wrong and I think
 
are really obviously wrong and I think
the first and most obvious one is well
the first and most obvious one is well
 
the first and most obvious one is well
if you are trying to replicate what you
if you are trying to replicate what you
 
if you are trying to replicate what you
did in an office in a remote setting you
did in an office in a remote setting you
 
did in an office in a remote setting you
will
will
 
will
fail and I I think that is mostly
fail and I I think that is mostly
 
fail and I I think that is mostly
because the way that we act in offices
because the way that we act in offices
 
because the way that we act in offices
is really outdated and it doesn't match
is really outdated and it doesn't match
 
is really outdated and it doesn't match
the current reality but it's very easy
the current reality but it's very easy
 
the current reality but it's very easy
and so what I mean with that is that I
and so what I mean with that is that I
 
and so what I mean with that is that I
think we manage a lot based on whether
think we manage a lot based on whether
 
think we manage a lot based on whether
you see people you know buts in seats
you see people you know buts in seats
 
you see people you know buts in seats
and we know rationally that that's not a

so that's a pretty big one too many
so that's a pretty big one too many
 
so that's a pretty big one too many
meetings that's a really big one but

great you know standard on remote work
so you know when we ran gitlab we
so you know when we ran gitlab we
 
so you know when we ran gitlab we
created this handbook that this open so
created this handbook that this open so
 
created this handbook that this open so
that other people could learn from it
that other people could learn from it
 
that other people could learn from it
and we do the same at remote and what we
and we do the same at remote and what we
 
and we do the same at remote and what we
find is that and it's quite
find is that and it's quite
 
find is that and it's quite
intentionally so is that there's a lot
intentionally so is that there's a lot
 
intentionally so is that there's a lot
of similarities but there's also a lot

heavily at remote we didn't have that at
heavily at remote we didn't have that at
 
heavily at remote we didn't have that at
gitlab so we had to sort of build our
gitlab so we had to sort of build our
 
gitlab so we had to sort of build our
own solution for that but also we decide
own solution for that but also we decide
 
own solution for that but also we decide
to do things in a different way and we
to do things in a different way and we
 
to do things in a different way and we
found that at even though we do things
found that at even though we do things
 
found that at even though we do things
very differently in some ways at remote

very differently in some ways at remote
it still works and so to say is remote

better or worse even though they're
better or worse even though they're
 
better or worse even though they're
completely differently you know we don't
completely differently you know we don't
 
completely differently you know we don't
really know and so that that to me is
really know and so that that to me is
 
really know and so that that to me is
like the the real interesting bit is
