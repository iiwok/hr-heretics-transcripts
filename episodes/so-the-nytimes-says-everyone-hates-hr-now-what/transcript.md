all right everybody how you doing out
there another HR heretic special segment
Nolan um to lead us in here a lot of
folks are talking about this article
that launched yesterday um no not
yesterday two days ago August 3rd uh the
New York Times the title perfectly
enough is so Human Resources making you
miserable and basically the net of this
article is all about how you know
employees hate HR essentially uh they
don't like the function they don't like
what it does their views on the function
and the kicker is that the article also
highlighted HR people hating their own
jobs so basically agreeing with
employees that they they're miserable in
their own jobs and there is a lot of
Juicy things in this I and a lot of
folks are talking about in different HR
communities I think we've seen some of
the you know some of the cynicism from
HR folks over the last few years given
everything that we've been dealing with
but this this this article packaged it
up perfectly in a nice little bow
of terribleness so to speak so i' love
I'd love your take what well I want to
start with what are you hearing in HR
communities like what are the community
saying yeah look I mean I I think look
the last three years starting with the
pandemic then the world events right
then the the George Floyd events and
things of that nature which were awful
and then parlaying right into return to
office and all these things I think that
HR people feel like they've been put in
a role where they're like wait a minute
I didn't sign up for
this like what just
happened got it um and so I think folks
are feeling like that's where we talk
about burnout that's where we talk about
you expecting to be all these things and
it's thankless a big theme in this
article was the job was thankless
because it's a no- win right no matter
what you do or how you do it employees
are going to see you as the bad person
the scapegoat the fall person and we've
talked a lot about different episodes
right that sometimes HR is that voice
representing unpopular things and it's
coming out of their mouth and I think
people are kind of fed up on it so they
go to conferences and they commiserate
with each other which is really helpful
and therapeutic but it's not changing
the day-to-day of the job okay so I want
to acknowledge first it's been a brutal
few years for HR recruiting covid
RTO
layoffs the George Floyd
event there's it's been brutal and
there's also been I would say like a
pendulum
of oh go run an Institute Dei to now
it's evaporate all Dei programs and that
stuff is
exhausting here's my
question is the current situation in HR
worse than the rest of the
business and like I I just think about
you know B2B SAS right now and if you're
on a go to market team or you're a cro
of a B2B SAS company Y and you're in the
trenches every day selling a product
against a bunch of AI startups in a
world where things are getting cheaper
your CFO wants to raise prices Gmail
basically eliminated outbound
emailing and your bosses are turning the
screws for more and more
productivity yeah why don't we hear them
complaining in the same way that we've
been hearing this from HR now I think
for four five
years and I actually think articles like
this discuss like why there is a
fractured relationship between HR and
the
business and this is I agree with you I
that's why I wanted to hear like what
did the community say because I've been
hearing the same thing which is like yes
this is exactly what's going on this is
exactly our problem and I just want to
take a step back and say I think work is
a huge part of our lives but work cannot
solve all of our problems in our
lives and I I think I've had this
convers ation with employees to when you
start bringing in other aspects of your
life into work and expecting your work
environment to solve those
problems I don't think that's a
realistic thing and I think what's
actually happening here is for sure the
the expectations have changed and the
the goalposts have moved but it's not
just for HR people it's for the entire
business and I think what we're what
we're really seeing here
is expectations have changed from many
of the folks in our profession Kelly
about what an employer should be and
that is where the deep unsatisfaction is
coming from is that they want their
employer to be everything that they
expect from their world and they're
using their employer as a vehicle to
bring World change and the employer is
pushing back against that world change
yeah that's what I think is underneath
this and that's what I think is actually
going on I I my response and obser one
my observations is along that thread
right so go go back to what you said are
other leaders complaining like the sales
example I don't know maybe but what I
what I'm empathizing with in this
article and then I don't have an
empathetic side so my empathetic side is
I do agree that I think the HR role has
been expected to be much more of a
chameleon than potentially other roles I
think that it is like oh di world events
Wars pandemics are RTO HR person go do
and fix all of this like the whole SE
Suite stops and looks at the HR person
who's never done any of that
before right and I think that's
exhausting being that person that has to
keep changing and shifting and I don't
think other leaders get that to that
extent so I think there is a difference
there now on the other side of it it's
our fault that we are accepting that so
for example I'll use pendo a great
example every SE Suite member in town
hall Anonymous amas answers all types of
questions an RTO question comes in the
sales leader will answer it like a covid
questions come in the CEO will answer it
um a comp question came in the head of
product answered it so I think my my my
tough love answer is that there is a way
without you know being lazy or
deflecting your role to not accept all
this stuff on your own shoulders and to
do it in a way that that not just HR
owns this stuff so so what I what I'm
saying like that's what I do and then
the roles that I've held is you are the
master of your own destiny and you can
actually architect like your own misery
or not your own misery and maybe you'll
have to make a hard choice at the end if
if if that company does want you to be
the doormat of a different color every
 day and you're just that that's
what they expect of you that's a
different conversation but for great
companies and good cultures with
reasonable leaders I do think that HR
can spread the love I do think that we
can control this this you know miserable
situation we have and I think I think it
is changeable I really do I mean even
the
employees you know I welcome feedback
from those who are listening where I've
run HR at different companies but I'm
out there I'm in the trenches I'm
talking to them I'm giving them tough
love I'm explaining the why it's
transparent and almost every company
they're like oh yeah we don't like HR
but you guys are different like this is
this is a different so just be that um
you know so I I do think it gets a bad
rap I do think we get dragged through
the mud I do think the expectations can
be unfair I do think the job can be
thankless and I do think that we do have
control over how we adjust that and I
think we're going to have to do that
more there's a couple things that you
said in there which I actually think
have to do with the role of HR
and a couple things that you said with
the pendo example is one a comp question
comes up and the head of product answers
it correct and so translation for me is
HR is not forcing a Compensation Program
on the business the
business help in combination with HR but
really the business driving it designs
the comp program HR helps them
understand the tradeoffs and helps them
implement it and then helps them learn
and get better as time goes on as we get
more data points from that program yes
but then when the program comes up the
person who's in charge of defending the
program is the business owner because
they are the one who owns the thing HR
is is just an administrator of that
program other you know does that make
sense do you agree with that like hr's
job is not to own culture it's not to
own comp it's to facilitate these
programs to help Business Leaders
understand tradeoffs to make the
business run faster and that feels like
what you're doing at pendo what am I
missing from that Kelly I don't think
you're missing much I think if anyone's
listening to this and they're like I'm
banging my head against the wall one
thing I would do tomorrow that may be
different than today is when you go into
these leadership meetings and they're
all looking at us with popcorn ready to
be like what are we going to do about
RTO you lead off with all right team
what are we going to do
with RTO right it's it's the
group's challenge right it's the group's
baby and everything is I'm not just not
being a whiny baby here and talking
about us but like at looker when the cro
is like hey Global expansion sales teams
let's go into the nordics France Germany
that's a group discussion right the the
the subject matter expert the
administrator of that of course is on
the revenue side we're going to
implement this with help but but but
that discussion isn't everyone being
like whatat are we doing right that is a
a strategic conversation that's shared
by a group of leaders that own the
business
together and in doing that you are
equipping you are helping those folks
learn and frankly expecting of them to
have your back and to explain this
 
stuff that yes I will go back to an
episode that we had with Steve cigan who
was linked chro it's one of my favorite
episodes if you haven't listened to it
you absolutely should and
described performance reviews and
everybody on the LinkedIn exec team
 hated performance reviews hated
the processed everything associated with
it and so Steve contorted it instead of
him being like the person who was like
we must do performance reviews Steve
said well let's just kill
it yep and then the exact team was like
wait what what Steve we can't kill
performance reviews and he's like why
not you guys hate it why why keep doing
it and totally he did this really
interesting Jedi mind trick in that
process which he stopped owning
performance reviews he sto being like
you know I'm wearing like the
performance review thing on my chest and
like I show up and say we have to do
this and instead he started paring back
what the business was
saying and once he started doing that he
helped clarify their thinking for what
they actually wanted to do and the
problems they actually wanted to
solve and I think you know when I think
about people like Steve uh I think about
people like LJ Brock I think about
people like Patty mcord uh and Pat
waters you know the goats of our
profession and one of the things that I
I take from these people is they they
find a way to to turn problems
and look at them from different
angles and so they instead of them being
like we own performance reviews or we
own comp or like H like take on more and
more and more just because the business
says they do it they come at it from
different angles and they present
different aspects of the argument and
then they present tradeoffs and then
they boil it down to experiments and
then they go run those experiments and
then they report back on those
experiments and it's just this iterative
approach to getting things done that we
don't know actually like how it's going
to play out because that's that's all
business like we talked about bar Riser
this past week Kelly yes and bar Riser
works for Amazon it works awesome for
Amazon it may not work for your company
and so to figure out that process of
what works for your company I think
requires an HR leader this is this is
the job for me which is helping Business
Leaders evaluate tradeoffs helping them
frame why it's important to employees
helping them frame how we're going to
test and run the experiment and then
helping roll it out and then helping
everyone else who's joining the company
understand it and then get better over
time that for me is the job and that's
where I think what's been happening is
it's been more dictatorial from the
business go do
RTO yes and many HR leaders go I'm on it
versus well why and what are we
optimizing for and okay great here's
what you're going to need to contribute
in order to make this a successful
program and I I this is where I will
empathize with HR leaders is I feel like
many people do that and their executive
team says I don't want to have this
conversation anymore just go make it
happen we already told you and that is a
core problem in the profession is when
there is no understanding of what these
things take to roll out that is where
friction certainly happens where there
just isn't you know I'll use the term
empathy right now um and when those
situations happen I strongly believe you
need to have a come to Jesus
conversation with your CEO and it's look
I can help you do whatever you want to
do but I don't own these things you own
these things our exec team owns these
things that is our first team we need to
own these things together versus me
taking on all of this ownership and
responsibility hey everyone we'll be
right back in a moment after a word from
our sponsors real talk most Talent
leaders haven't yet cracked how to
leverage AI for Meaningful impact on
their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting team's efficiency and quality
use metaview metaview is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
candidates during calls and save time on
the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline hiring teams
can make confident informed decisions
and talent leaders can finally take
control of the interview process join

minutes here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet the lighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where

a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics
 
say and I I do agree that there is
certainly an issue with uh Business
Leaders throwing problems onto HR and
and just saying I don't want to hear
about it anymore just like go make it
happen and that I will empathize with
and that I think is a real problem
it is a problem and I've said so many
times on this you know show over the
year Nolan that we we train people how
to treat us right we we we train people
how to treat us and this article says
like HR bugs employees and leaders right
we're the business you're HR well let's
just break that down like we I do I'm
not saying everybody but I've I'm
generally
speaking we have allowed that to happen
right and the only way that will change
is if every single one of us and every
single one of these
companies puts your foot down and puts a
stop to that and there is a graceful way
to do that right you can't be a jerk you
can't you know you're not going to
change someone's mind that can't be
changed but there is a graceful way to
influence and change that to your point
it starts with mindset it starts with
well am I allowing them to put me in
this box am I spending all day you know
listening to people complaining and
pushing paper and doing programs that I
haven't really actually thought about
from a first principal's perspective do
I know how this business runs can do I
ever say anything in the room outside of
my remit on my opinion on how we make
products or make money or serve
customers like the these are things that
over time it doesn't just happen you
can't just walk into the company the
next day and say I'm not this and you're
going to listen to me like you have to
change these things with mindset and
behavior over and over over and over
until it happens a hundred times and
then you'll get these people say oh well
yeah HR sucks but you're different and
then maybe 15 years from now they won't
actually say HR
sucks you're totally right and going
back to LJ in in our episode with LJ one
of the things he said about when we
asked him about his relationship with
Brian coinbase is
CEO he said well you just never know
until you go through a fire
together yes and I I've thought a lot
about that I think he's 100% right I
think there's like a a onea to that
which
is you can't go back in time you can
only move forward and so if you think
about the relationship between HR and
the other Business Leaders it begins in
the interview
process and then it it continues to
evolve as you live through these
situations and I think a lot of people
have have acquired relationship
debt and they haven't either pushed back
appropriately they haven't asked the
business to take on their share of
responsibility maybe they've actually
been coming from a place of trying to
help the business and they helped too
much and now the expectations have
shifted on them and so I think a lot of
this has to do with we all have
complicated relationships with the rest
of the executive team but those Rel that
relationship debt is I think a a little
bit of a a backdrop to what's going on
here because HR has taken on a lot and
now well they just keep taking on more
so just keep throwing it over and if I
don't have to own this problem as a
business leader and you're going to
continue to own it for me that I like
that and I think a lot of times there
needs to be a resetting of the
relationship and in in the moment right
now it's where HR budgets are getting
cut it's scary to reset that
relationship yes my my one comment based
on what you just said about LJ and and
going through the fire early with an
executive is my push back to that for
those of you who are listen saying that
sounds great you guys are full of
that can't that's too hard to yes like I
could not do that my whole career I was
younger I was early you're a pleaser
you're trying to mold it's hard to take
that step because there's risk to it um
or you might be saying this all sounds
great but my company is a total disaster
and I don't even know what to do next or
my boss is incompetent they like find
someone then to help you call call us
find a mentor find a coach find someone
outside of your company then that can
give you one confidence and perspective
uh to to do this and two the nuances of
how because again that matters you can't
just run in and stomp your feet and
break relationships so you know the
advice we're we're we're giving or what
we're talking about I do think there's
Nuance to it I get the push back and and
there are there are ways to figure that
out hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors

Heretics Kelly you are so right one of
my biggest regrets at door
Dash is I didn't call outside help to
one gut check me and then two to help me
influence leadership and what you're
describing is relationship
Capital inside of an organization and I
don't know why this exists you and I
have had this joke privately a number of
times
but Brett recer who worked at seoa for
 
at door Dash and I was telling him some
of the things that we were trying to do
and there was like push back internally
and yeah Brett goes oh I can let me just
like have a conversation with Tony and I
can help you handle that and so he go
have a conversation with Tony and then
that thing would then happen and I was
like Brett why doesn't you know why
doesn't Tony just listen to me he goes
Nolan it's just always the case of like
sometimes hearing it from someone else
who has more experience or who has more
clout can help you get that thing done
and at that moment in my career my ego
couldn't handle me not influencing the
way I wanted to and so learn from me on
this one which is just because you have
uh the right idea um doesn't mean you
have to be the direct person that
influences the person who can say yes to
that idea there are other angles and
other ways to manage the game for things
to just get get it done and over time
there is a catalog of wins and losses on
the executive team of like who had the
right idea who got it right who got it
wrong and you'll be able to point back
to those uh and so it's just about like
doing the right thing and influencing in
the right way and every leadership team
has different Dynamics and different
ways that influence can affect them and
so Kelly's exactly right I wish I would
have leaned more on outside help to help
me get things done yeah I look I I talk
about about this a lot and those of you
who have worked with me for years know I
call it the six sense of this job um the
five senses of this job are the easy
part like we all have hopefully the
technical and the functional skill sets
to do the damn job right what makes or
break success as a leader or individual
Rising with influence in an organization
is that six sense and it's exactly those
things you're talking about how am I
nuancing the communication timing is
everything how am I lever ing folks
around me how am I like and that's all I
do now right I'm an adviser a mentor a
CO like I work with individuals on a
monthly basis because this is the thing
that someone could be so brilliant maybe
like you were or good at your craft and
you couldn't manage your way of a paper
bag you couldn't you couldn't figure it
out and this is what I think makes or
breaks this this job and these companies
and undos a lot of those generalizations
on HR that we read in that article I I
fundamentally believe that and it's not
just with leaders it's with employees
like the fastest way to turn your
reputation in a company is to get the
 
company to talk differently about HR and
it's done like it's it's very important
I'm not saying that in inauthentic way
um authentic
way so true if you win over the key
people in the company and you build deep
relationships with them and honestly
this is the this is the layer of
influencing deep into the game which is
if you go ask them what their their
thoughts are and then you start riffing
with them and workshopping with them
maybe you do start to change your
opinion a little bit or maybe you start
to influence them a little bit and they
can help you roll things out totally
another another aspect on this you know
when we had uh you and I had drinks with
uh with Patty McCord and you were
talking about your time at is it was it
gitlab a GitHub GitHub you were talking
about your time at GitHub and and Patty
being able to you know you were just
pulling your hair out and Patty walks in
has a conversation with you has one
conversation with the CEO and all of a
sudden things start to
change and yeah it's just yes it's how
it works it's interesting like at pendo
we had Todd on right he's a fiery guy
he's he's can be difficult he's and
people are like hey can you go talk to
Todd you know how to that's not magic
and it's not luck um it's and it's not
fake that there's a way to do these
things especially with founder CEOs and
you know difficult brilliant people it's
just a it's just a thing there's also
things you can't teach though which is
tenure and clout and you know you have a
great reputation now when you were there
Patty I mean Patty's still the goat but
you know Patty with what she was doing
at Netflix any CEO would have listened
to whatever Patty was going to say and
so I just think leveraging those things
a to I do want to tell this story Kelly
of this EXA offsite that I went to that
really changed my life and we did an
exercise um and I'll I'll I'll hat tip
uh Andrew Blum at trium group for
putting this one on so he he paired us
off with another exec didn't tell us
what was going to come and he goes I
want you to tell a victim story
something that that happened to you like
you thought was terrible you know that
you were wronged and you know tell the
person the story of three minutes and so
I told a story and the story I told was
around I I didn't exercise my options at
door Dash and it was all about like you
know I made it all about the company's
fault and then he did this master trick
which just completely warped my mind
then he said okay now spend the next
three minutes taking full
responsibility for what
happened and as I spoke and as I started
to think about how I was responsible I
had never actually considered that I was
responsible until this
moment as I started owning
responsibility my entire worldview
shifted and that exercise I have thought
about at least on a weekly basis when I
get into the victim mindset when I start
blaming other people and that's what I
think about when I read this article is
that we as HR Pros we're blaming the
business we're blaming the CEO we're
blaming all of the things that we have
to take on versus well instead of taking
the the victim mindset what if we took
the responsible mindset and what if we
took ownership of the things that were
happening and how would that shift not
only how we thought and felt but how we
showed up at work and the impact that we
were able to have in the relationship
that at the executive
 
level yeah uh you know it's hard because
a lot of those things in the art article
are true and I commiserate with it it's
annoying and it's it's like frankly
anger inducing at times and some CEOs
just don't get it however and I give
people this I'm like it's fine to go
pout in the corner for a couple days and
blah blah blah but walking around with
resentment and anger like all the time
or that mentality it's going to hurt no
one but yourself like it'll just
backfire it'll show up in your body
language your work how communicate your
personal life which will screw your work
life up and vice versa it all just it's
a downward Vortex and so to your point
how do you turn it up and maybe it's not
work maybe it's you know go running go B
like go do something for for yourself
and then you actually feel better and
you can get back into that zone but I've
been there and it's it's just um they
don't care they don't care that we're
angry or resentful you know what I mean
like it's up to us to figure that out so
maybe maybe the commiseration at the
conferences that was mentioned in the
article can turn into what should I
freaking do what should we do um those
convers which I'm sure they're having
however it's just we got to figure out
how to turn this this is a big this is a
big sound blite though have you read
Abigail shri's bad Therapy
book no sounds fascinating it's really
interesting and and the the high level
synopsis is is that like the the
overemphasis On Emotion
um leads to more anxiety and emotional
weakness and instead like what she she
advocates for is building
resilience and I don't think we talk
enough about resilience in in today's
world and being able to just deal with
some of this which sucks but like
it always most things like that are
challenging kind of suck in the moment
but if you're able to handle them and
you're able to move forward and to build
on top of them my personal belief is
that you become more resilient and you
become stronger and I think this is
what's happening at pendo I think pendo
is a great HR case study for our
audience is yeah you walked in with some
clout for sure you know I remember when
Todd came on like oh look her was like a
weird company and they kind of did
things
interesting but live through the
fire of
building you know building with Todd a
company called culture of Rolling Out
programs of making mistakes of getting
better of RTO of all of these different
things and you've built relationships
and clout and ultimately you've built
resilience in yourself and Jr and your
team and I think that that's what I
really want people to take away who
listen to this show is My Strong
guidance to you is focus more on solving
the
problem and the problem will get solved
faster
versus all of these other emotions
versus the you know the the world in
general wants to promote complaining and
I'm not saying don't complain like you
have to have your Outlets but what I am
saying is is focus on the problem and
the solution will present itself much
much faster yeah I also I also just to
maybe end I I also don't think that we
appreciate or think about outside of
work and what that does for us when we
do go into work so to speak like we
separate these things and like for me I
I build my own resilience so much with
things I do outside of work and when I
go into work right you're and just going
to be honest you're happier you're more
confident you have more joy like humans
react to those
things people are drawn into that they
appreciate it the it's a um a visceral
feeling do you know what I mean it's
infectious and so is the other side if
you walk in the opposite
really quick what do you what do you do
to build
resilience oh I'm a big physical person
so like if I'm if I'm feeling like I'm
in shape and I'm healthy and I'm
energetic like it's not about weight
it's about strength and um a little
adrenaline and you're you're you're
getting energy from those things if I
have a great relationship with my wife
and our kids and we're doing fun stuff
and I'm feeling fulfilled outside it's
like either either when I go inside you
can't touch me because I'm like in the
zone I'm I'm but usually it's it's
you're bringing that energy to others
you can be more creative you can solve
problems you are more empathetic to
others because you're happy right like
we you know when you go to like a
restaurant or something like I was a
server so I'll say this but sometimes if
you're in a bad mood dude every table
sees it like tips go down day is your
day is crap like what's like it's just
happens so I just I I think that there's
a lot of ways we build resilience inside
of work with people we work etc but it's
not the only way and I think that our
work and our personal lives in interact
with each other more viscerally and more
prominently than we often give credit to
I I totally agree with you I think about
I have to prioritize myself before I
prioritize anyone else and so for me
that means sleeping well like I have to
get eight hours of sleep now I used to
be able to run on five or six those days
are over
I have to work out every day and I have
to eat healthy that's number one number
two is like relationships so with my
wife with my kids with my friends I have
to have community and relationships and
talking with my people and like have to
have that number three for me is
location like I have to be in a place to
where that's giving me energy that's
feeding with the same amount of energy
that I have and number four for me is is
spiritual and I won't elaborate more on
what this means for me but I think there
is an aspect of spiritualness regardless
of whatever your religious beliefs are
of like you have to connect spiritually
in some way shape or form and going back
to what I said at the beginning of the
show I do think we're forcing a lot of
this on to work and we're having we're
expecting to get these things from work
and you can't you can't get all of them
at work you can get some of them but you
cannot get all of them and there is work
that we need to do especially as Leaders
on our own in order to show up our best
in in order to make the impact and the
influence that we want to have inside of
a company so this was a blast Kelly yeah
