all right hi everyone welcome to another
episode here of HR Heretics I am so
happy to have Chris yay here I have
known of and kind of known Chris I mean
I'm not gonna prend we're friends but
I've been a fan for probably like 20
years and seen you speak a bunch of
times and we're happy to come on and
talk about all the things I don't even
know how to talk about your background
because it's literally spans author
Venture partner Mentor academic
instructor co-founder and board member
so we've got like a lot of surface area
we got a legend on Kelly I don't know
how we're gonna be 40 minutes but I'm so
humbled free to have you have you on
Chris and it's so good to see you again
thank you it is my pleasure and I still
I can't remember the exact show which
was the first time that we finally got a
chance to meet but I remember we got to
speak on the same panel and I remember
when I met you I was like oh my gosh
Kelly is awesome I'm so glad I now have
her in my life and it's great to be here
and be a part of HR Heretics yeah see I
even blanked we were on the same panel
together because I was just so a struck
I totally blacked out that I wasn't even
on the panel with you so awesome well
Nolan kick us off my friend yeah so so
Chris I've been as I've been preparing
for this episode I've been watching all
of your stuff and the thing that strikes
me about you is you just have this
palpable energy like it it it emanates
through the screen when I watch your
YouTubes where does that come from and
how does somebody who has been around
the block as many times as you have been
around still have that much juice so I
will give it credit to a couple things
the first Baseline level is as you know
there is this notion of a set point for
happiness that people have and so mine
is jammed way up and then somebody like
threw away that lever it kept it kept it
up there so I'm just generically one of
the happiest most optimistic people
you're going to meet and that helps
Drive the energy of course optimism and
energy are not directly correlated but
there's a very strong Association the
second thing I would say is that I have
a long history of public speaking and
performance so when people talk to me
about my academic career and I went to
Stanford as an undergraduate I studied
product design engineering and creative
writing but also very critically I
studied drama and improvisational acting
I studied public speaking and then
taught public speaking for the
engineering school I studied peer
counseling and then was a peer counselor
for years and of course I was part of an
improv comedy troop for a number of
years as well so from those formative
years I was learning to be on stage and
a big part of being on stage is
conveying the energy that you have and I
think Kelly you were talking about you
know seeing me speak one of the things I
try to do is I tell people listen the
audience is going to have a good time
if the speaker is having a good time and
the audience is going to feel energetic
if the speaker is energetic you can't go
up there and I don't want to throw shade
on my industry but if you've ever seen
venture capitalist speak on stage the
vast majority of the most boring people
imaginable now the funny thing is
they're actually smart fasinating
individuals but because they've got it
in their mind I'm a dignified venture
capitalist I must speak like this yes
we're very interested in in finding
companies we like to back the best
entrepreneurs and we really do a great
job of finding them like no like I love
entrepreneurs they're incredible when I
see an entrepreneur and I think that
they've got it I'm like wow I got to
spend more time with this person I mean
show you're excited don't just say
you're excited yep I I love that so Alex
Heros has this notion around passion and
he thinks passion is overrated because
you know like my parents used to say
this to me as a kid like oh go go follow
your passion and his take is is actually
like passion comes from your acquisition
of skills and then ultimately getting
towards the Mastery of those skills you
seem like somebody who loves what they
do would you agree with that take or do
you disagree with that take I would say
I largely agree and but I would put my
own spin on it so what I would say is
this that passion is not something that
is just you know given from on high and
it absolutely is the case that you
develop passion for something the more
you do it you develop passion for it I
never did improv before I took an improv
class and then I was like wow this is
amazing I hadn't done design thinking
until I started studying product design
and I was like wow this is great this is
kind the kind of stuff I really love and
so you've got to try these different
things you're not born with the passion
you develop the passion from actually
experiencing something and hopefully
getting something out of it but what I
will also say on top of that is that the
reason why it the the take resonates
with me is because far too many people
are like follow your passions I'm like
some of your passions are useful some of
them are not let's be clear about this
you got to be useful in this world I
love that we love a good dose of realism
on this show too Chris so I mean back to
the energy I it's a great question Nolan
and you know Nolan and I talk we had an
episode a while back around kind of
Charisma in leadership and if that's
helpful and he called it RZ I had no
idea what that yeah Chris has RZ chis
has RZ absolutely RZ is the thing yeah
it is the thing and so we talked about
Charisma we talked about when you have
wonderful leaders in organizations that
are like these boring VC folks but they
just can't seem to get it going and the
importance of winning hearts and minds
and Leadership and can you instill that
and I was like I look you can't you know
totally change someone but you can help
them raise it up get some Riz and I
don't know I think I remember no one
disagreeing with me on that but I think
you can
deploy some hacks if you will to help
folks do that and I wanted to get your
take on that 100% so here is the thing
and I think this speaks to the the
notion of Charisma right so Charisma is
something that's not just based on
performance I actually was having a
conversation online about this recently
Charisma is about the ability to connect
with the audience you could be a great
performer if you don't connect with the
audience you don't actually have
Charisma you're just very loud and so
really about that connection now can we
teach people to have that connection at
some level they're going to have a level
of empathy ability to read people some
people are better than others at it no
question but everyone can learn to be
better right everyone can learn okay
look for these signs this shows you that
the audience is interested right you
could see them leaning forward you could
see them not staring at their phones
right so all these things are things
that you can absolutely learn and when I
taught public speaking we would teach
specific techniques around eye contact
and how you stand and how you gesture
that would all help people be more
charismatic the toughest part however is
you cannot convert an introvert into an
extrovert you can give an introvert
amazing social skills and the ability to
wow an audience but you can't turn them
into an extrovert and that's the
toughest part if you're an introverted
leader you may be as charismatic as all
heck but putting that Charisma out there
and connecting with the audience
consumes a vast amount of your energy
and you'll have to go and recharge
afterwards whereas a 100% died and W
extrovert like me the more audiences
there are the more excited I get the
more energetic I'll be up until the very
end of the day when I crash right and
and the hard part I found about you you
both but I found is in trying to instill
something in someone that they may not
naturally have it's very dangerous to
instill it so much they become something
they're not and it just looks fake and
silly and and you know and then they
actually lose the audience more than if
they were going to stand up there like a
Rob so there's a the slippery slope
there absolutely all right so so Chris I
watched your Ted Talk and uh for those
that that haven't seen it yet it's
around infinite learning and I love this
quote from you you said we often praise
people for learning new things but I'm
going to suggest that we should also
praise them for unlearning old things
and you used a couple of awesome
examples like the Nokia phone the floppy
disc the headphon Jack and you go on to
say that every lesson has an expiration
date unlearning I find is a skill that
most people are not good at why do you
think that's the case well it's very
simple we as human beings don't like
uncertainty we like feeling we've got it
figured out and I know because I like
feeling that I figured it out as well I
mean I can remember think back to what
happens on the first day of school when
you are in grade school or junior high
or something like that or maybe your
first day of high school like oh my God
I'm so nervous what's going to happen
and then by the end of high school
you're like I got this dialed in I know
what's going on and we like that feeling
of being a confident senior not a scared
freshman but the fact is that as the
world changes around us it doesn't
matter how confident we feel we really
are that scared freshman we really do
have to learn something new because
whatever worked for us in junior high or
Elementary School whatever you maybe
being able to make that flatulating
sound with your armpit or something like
that that kills when you're in the
fourth or fifth grade probably not going
to work in the 12th grade you got to
learn some new skills wow and then I
guess like the the next piece so taking
it towards tech companies when you think
about team building how do you think
about building a team of infinite
Learners yes so this is a tough one
right then obviously when it comes to
building a team of infant Learners part
of it relies on the individuals being
able to do it but part of it is that
learning is a team sport right we often
think of learning as an individual sport
but it's really a team sport like when
we learn we're learning from people
around us we're not just in a silo by
ourselves so creating an environment
where people are rewarded and praised
for Learning and unlearning by the way
creating a place where people are
encouraged to share and to you know be
explicit about their metacognition like
hey here's why I'm thinking what I'm
thinking as opposed to just arguing
positions and fact facts and things like
that really focus on here's why we know
what we know I think that the right term
I use it just to sound smart but I'm not
entirely certain this is right is
epistemology what what does that mean
the science of knowing why we know
things got it so we love to kind of you
know jump into the the the contradictory
here Chris and the tough like that
sounds wonderful and if I'm a Sounder
CEO a leader an H art like in these
companies where I'll speak for myself
like we can't even go to the bathroom
during the day half the time let alone
breathe or get stuff done it's so Under
Pressure to execute and meet
deliverables and now with less resources
how do you how do you how how do I how
do you answer the question Chris how do
I find time for that because that sounds
wonderful sounds very mindful it sounds
self-actualizing how do I create time
for that when we're all literally on the
edge so there's a there's something that
I learned from my very first startup so
I started my first company in 1999
during the.com boom I was literally a
 
and I just remember always thinking hey
if I can just write one more email if I
can just take one more meeting if I
could just do this one more thing and I
just worked all the time believe me my
wife will tell you was not a good time
to be married to me but what I
eventually learned from that experience
is it's like actually you know the
amount of work that is available for us
to do is nearly infinite and it doesn't
matter how hard we work there's always
more we didn't do and so the principle
to get things done is not to outwork
everyone else and do more work and spend
more time working and less time sleeping
less time interacting with others it's
too prioritize and when you let go of
the notion that you'll be able to do
everything that you're supposed to do
like I'm like hey you know what I know
there's like these things in my email
inbox that I should respond to I know
there's all this stuff I'm like listen
I'm going to forgive myself that I can't
do everything because the world
literally has sends me twice as many
emails as I could ever possibly human
respon humanly respond to so I'm gonna
let that go and what I'm gonna do
instead is say okay let me just be very
careful and figure out what is really
important and as primitive as it sounds
what I actually do is I actually find
little strips of paper and I write down
the things I absolutely have to do and I
just keep them with me and I look at
what's the next thing and I cross it off
that's it because you'll never get to
everything you'll never be able to do
everything you want to do I love that
because I used to be the same way right
I was like in my 20s and just like grind
killing myself and I remember you know I
kind of let go of that about five six
years ago and the thing that I had in my
mind to let go of that was just make it
a test right make it an experiment see
what happens if you don't respond to
every single slack within 10 minutes see
who screams see what happens if you
don't do something at 10: at night and
do it at 11:00 a.m. in the morning
nothing really happened and so it's it's
it's it's funny how we create these kind
of consequences in our brain we do have
more time for things like that so that's
interesting by the way I want to give
credit to my wife for something here
which is you know one of the things that
we often do especially when we're
younger is we think we're indispensable
we think that everything will go to heck
without us it'll all fall apart and that
was one of the reasons why I didn't take
a lot of vacation
when I was younger and this was even in
the pre 911 era so it was a lot easier
to travel then and my wife was always
like that's on you you had you could
have taken time off you had the money
you had worked for a company with an
unlimited vacation policy and you didn't
do that I'm like you're right you're
 
so I passed that advice on to other
people no matter how indispensable you
are obviously the world can get by
without you for a week or even two take
time off that's good
feedback hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting teams
efficiency and quality use metav view
metaview is the AI assistance for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join forward-thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
quora and check out metaview head over

minutes so Chris you wrote a book with
Reed Hoffman from LinkedIn and I just
I'd love for us to dive into that R in
with Chris on why did you do that how
did you do that how was that and just
some of the Dynamics between you two and
your philosophies absolutely so
basically The Story begins that I first
met Reed when he was starting LinkedIn
and I didn't know that he was going to
become such an important part of my life
I just thought that this LinkedIn thing
that he created was amazing and I
thought it was going to be hugely
successful sadly I was too young and
poor to invest in the company at the
time and I was too dumb not to
immediately quit my job and join the
company now again that would have meant
quitting my job where I was the head of
marketing for a company and joining a
startup in God knows what role but rest
assured I still would have made a lot
more money taking any role at LinkedIn
including janitor than I did with the
company where I was head a marketing
anyways I met Reed during that process
and got to know him a little bit but the
person who we can really give the credit
for bringing us together is my friend
and our other fellow co-author Ben Koka
so Ben and I met when he was a teenager
of all things we were commenting on the
same blogs and one day we got together
and again I can only imagine the
conversation with his parents hey can I
borrow the car I'm going to go drive
down to the peninsula from San Francisco
to go meet with my friend from the
internet who's 30 years old doesn't
sound creepy at all right but you know
we got together we started doing like
hosting intellectual salons and
everything like that and he also
separately got introduced to Reed and
fast forward to you know like around
 
know Reed Hoffman I'm like yeah Reed's a
great guy and Ben's like he's asking me
to write a book with him and I don't
know if I should do it I've already
written a book I don't we pigeon hold as
an often and I'm like well then how many
times in the past year has one of the
unquestioned Geniuses of the world asked
you to write a book with them he's like
well this is the first time I'm like
this kind of opportunity doesn't come
around very often I strongly urge you to
do this and so Ben ended up doing this
and he and Reed worked together on a
book called the startup of you it's
pretty famous came out in 2012 and after
the startup review came out and I was a
consultant on the book I helped them
structure it and gave them suggestions
I'm even in the book they said hey would
you come and meet with us I'm like of
course two guys I like no problem I go
to Reed's office at LinkedIn and they
say Hey you know we've got the startup
review out it's really interesting but a
lot of people asking the question if I'm
a company how do I deal with people with
this mental
and I'm like well that's a really good
point you guys should really do
something there and they're like well
actually we wondering if you wanted to
work with us on that because turns out
writing books is a lot of work and you
write faster than anyone else we know
and we think that you'll be able to
carry a lot of this load if you work
with us and I said okay tell you what
guys I have one question they're like
What's that does my name appear on the
cover they're like yes I'm like I'm in
they're like what you don't care about
money or anything like that I'm like you
guys are not going to screw me whatever
the deal is it's going to be more than
fair I just want to work with you guys
on this because yeah I totally get these
ideas after all I helped you as a
consultant on the content of your
previous book and I totally get where
this needs to go and I'd be delighted to
work and so we got together we ended up
writing the book The Alliance and the
mechanics of writing the book were that
we would meet at Reed's house every
Thursday morning
and we all set aside this time we' stay
outside Thursday morning because I still
had a full-time job as VP of marketing
for another company but we had Thursdays
off and with permission from the CEO of
that company I would go and actually
spend the Thursday mornings with Reed
because he's like obviously this a great
opportunity you should do it and also
they didn't want me to quit my job so so
we would get together and basically it
was a I call it a recursive process we
talk through the ideas and debate go
back and forth and then afterwards
meanwhile i' be taking notes afterwards
I would go and separately write it into
chapter form or something like that so
when people say oh you write the Books
I'm like well I do all the typing that's
what I mean and then we would go back
and revise it and there's some things
that Reed is particularly good at like
coming up with headlines and things like
that Reed is actually a brilliant
headline writer if he did not have his
day job as investor co-founder world
famous legendary entrepreneur he could
have been a great advertising copywriter
writing headlines for newspaper
interesting were there any things that
you kind of went to the mat on any
philosophies or concepts that you
disagreed on or was it just all duckies
and rainbows the whole way through Chris
the crazy thing is is it's primarily
duckies and rainbows there's actually a
reason for that and that is because Reed
and I had very similar experiences as
well that was one of the reasons why
when they approached me they said' oh we
had a long list of people you were first
on the list I'm like you don't need to
go to any of those other hacks I'm in
but the so both Reed and I went to
Stanford as undergraduates he went it
was class of 1989 I was class of 1994 so
there's zero overlap but we did very
similar things while we were in school
we both did something called structured
liberal education which is this very
intensive intellectual Humanities class
which takes up half your schedule where
you live in a dorm with other people
taking the class and where you have twoh
hour discussions every day about the
greatest works of philosophy his history
art Etc and we were both part of the
program we had the same instructors for
that program and then while we were at
Stanford we both did a mix of the
science and engineering side as well as
the humanities I did product design
engineering which is mechanical
engineering plus Art and Design thinking
as well as creative writing as part of
the English Department rid what is now
famously known as symbolic systems it's
well known in silica Valley because so
many famous EOS came out of the symbolic
Systems Department at Stanford but it's
basically a mix of computer science and
philosophy and Linguistics so it's that
combination much like you know Steve
Jobs would talk about like the power of
the humanities combined with technology
and science so we had similar
backgrounds new similar people and so we
formed similar ideas along the way so
Chris Chris I want to actually
understand that you know they said that
you were like the fastest person for
writing what are your secrets to to
making yourself right very quickly
excellent question the most important
thing is practice so I developed my
writing speed I was always fast even in
college and in college my greatest
achievement I I've often referred to
this one not that often but I I've
referred to it myself is there was one
particular paper I wrote for a class
where I went from doing the reading on
the paper to turning it in in 94 minutes
wow with with no chat gbt none of
that it is also the case with no chat
GPT I'm the original chat GPT it was
also the case that when I was working as
a head of marketing of an Enterprise
software company the record I set was I
once wrote a white paper in 30 minutes
so I have been very fast for a long time
but that speed was reinforced by the
rise of blogging in social media and I
don't blog as much as I used to because
back then it was sort of like the I
didn't have other releases for my
writing but I have written literally
thousands of blog posts and usually
because I was a busy person with a
family and responsibilities I'd be
writing as fast as I could and so I just
developed the ability to write really
quickly and not be self-conscious right
this is the thing that slows down
writing people are self-conscious about
what they're writing and saying like oh
how did that sound oh I don't know how's
this make me come off I'm like I got no
time let's go speaking of having no time
I I have to ask this because I'm I'm you
know not similar in a lot of ways but
similar where I'm like I could do this I
could do this I could do this like I S I
have like nine part-time jobs and I love
it and every I've heard you talk for the
last 23 minutes and there's literally
like hundred things you've done from
Academia to this that how did you like
handle all that in your brain Chris like
how did you not like let your brain
explode and how does you pick and
prioritize and choose because you seem
to be able to do anything and even now
I'm having a hard time with that every
day now that I'm out of the operating
role like tell us did you get help with
that do you have a framework in your
mind like what's going on so I I sadly
wouldn't say I've had help with it
although many people EXO the value of
coaching I've never actually had
coaching which is probably a bad thing I
should probably get coaching maybe
that'd be much better if I were if I had
a coach so what I would again say is I
had a lot of practice right growing up I
was always balancing things because my
dad has a PhD in electrical engineering
my late mother had a master's degree in
library science and children's
literature so I was always reading and
also doing science and math and doing
all these things at once and when I was
in Stanford same thing I would just load
myself with all sort of things I
discovered a loophole when I was at
Sanford by the way while I was there
they were shifting from paper based
cards to computerized systems for
picking your classes and for a brief
period of time one year I realized that
that you could actually take classes for
Less units than they were offered
because you had a unit limit you could
only take 20 units per quarter so I
figur out a way to for an entire year
take 30 units a quarter by taking
classes for Less units than they were
worth the university caught on and
closed that loophole a year later but I
did manage to get one year of this in
and so I was always very used to
juggling and doing these various things
and for me the main thing is not
multitasking like people sometimes talk
about multitasking like multitasking
does not work what I am really good at
is context switching and being able to
switch context immediately and what I do
today by the way this is not a this is a
this is a a more recent development but
I've refined it over time what I do is I
actually use music to help me do this so
when I am sitting down to do this kind
of work what I will do is I will
generally ask one of these devices that
is monitoring my voice at all times I
won't say its name so I won't set it off
and I ask it to play 1980s music now the
reason I do that is because science
shows that the music of your youth is
the thing that tends to make you feel
most creative and most youthful and
energetic and I literally find that even
if I'm dragging and having a hard time
you know you could turn on the 80s music
and George Michael or you know or Africa
comes on and all of a sudden you're
typing away love Toto I'm a big fan of
that song Africa and I do the same with
 
that's it's incredible Chris you you've
been doing all of these wonderful things
since the mid 90s and now we're 2025
pretty much H how have you stayed
relevant like I love tips and tricks
because I'm getting older and I have
other friends who are like well I'm not
relevant anymore I'm like well you could
be like how do you spend your time to to
do that and what's your plan on that
with AI because I'm sure you're doing it
now with that movement and I'd love to
extract that from you so this is
something that I recognized you know
going back 20 years because I would
interact with people who were our age
now and they would sounds so out of
touch it was insane I remember there was
an event we were going to do in the mid
 
maybe in his early 50s and we're saying
he was we're talking about the event and
the music we're going to play and I had
one of my younger employees come up with
a a playlist he's like you're not going
to play any that rap music are you that
fit that fit that I'm like oh my God you
sound like you're a thousand years old
get off my lawn and so I'm like I cannot
let that happen to me so what do I do to
stay relevant there are a couple things
the first the most important thing is
continue to develop friendships and
relationships with people who are young
or young at heart and I jokingly say oh
you know my young friends are now old
it's time to get a new set of young
friends but it's literally true and
being an instructor helps with that
right having a college like Stanford
bringing a supply of young people to me
is always a very a useful thing to have
happen but I believe and I have my
children and I pay attention to them as
well I try to see what they're doing and
so part of it is just tapping into
things that are happening that are new
and part of that for me also means
keeping track and this sounds crazy but
keeping track of popular culture right
so I knew what I know about Riz in an
earlier eras I would know who PewDiePie
was or these days I know that you know
everyone's upset about Netflix upset at
Netflix because of the Mike Tyson and
Jake Paul fight and the problems with
the switch streams and everything like
that so I try to keep track of popular
culture not because it's necessarily
like super relevant to the things I do
but because it's relevant to
understanding what people are thinking
about and what matters to them and so I
consume this now I try to consume it in
concentrated form like I don't have
enough time to watch every season of
real housewives on Bravo or something
like that but I can have awareness of
what Real Housewives is about yeah the
the spending time with young people
thing I heard first from Michael Ovitz
who's the founder of CA and once I heard
that it became so obvious to me I think
the other thing that you do that you
didn't you didn't say is that you remain
cool to young people who like aspire to
like be in this this life and this
career and I think about this all the
time I have this like electric
skateboard and my neighbor my neighbor
is like 13 years old and every time I'm
like on that thing he thinks I'm like
the coolest dude ever and there I think
there's something about that too to
where it's just like if you can also
remain playful and and like there's
something about the kids think you're
cool I think that that also keeps you
young for forever and the most important
thing about being cool as everyone knows
is the best way to be cool is to not
care about being cool and if you don't
care about being cool then people say
that's cool amen amen all right so I
want to talk about Blitz scaling for a
second so this is the book that you
co-authored with Reed and look I think
one of the truths about blit scaling is
that companies in this mode are
constantly changing and evolving and it
makes me think that two of the most
important skills to hire for when you're
thinking about employees at Blitz
scaling companies is adaptability and
resilience how do you assess people for
those skills so adapting resilience 100%
agree those are critical and the theme
of Blitz scaling and the theme of the
and ultimately the theme of the starup
is all about adaptability which feeds NE
neatly into the concept of being an
infinite laner as well so how do you
tell if somebody is adaptable well it's
hard right one of the things that Reed
has taught me over the years and
something he's mentioned a number of
times is that to assess someone we
believe in what we see with our with it
with our own eyes the problem is our own
eyes lie and it's difficult in a half
hour interview to really assess someone
and one of the things Reed says is it's
far more important to go ahead and check
references and talk to people who have
interacted with that person for
thousands of hours because that person
cannot have hidden their true self for
thousands of hours and so one of the
first things is that reference checking
ask people talk to me about this person
are they adaptable are they resilient
but then the other thing that you do
when you are because do actually have to
try to assess them anyways right even
though the the references are more
important you just ask them tell me
about an example where you were knocked
down and how you got back up tell me
about something that you had to come
back from tell me about a time when you
thought you had learned a lesson and
then you discovered it no longer applied
and the people who naturally think in
adaptable ways and are resilient will
have those stories easily come to mind
and the people who are not will not yeah
and you you wrote Blitz scaling with
Reed in 2018 you know and fast forward
five years later seven years later there
we go I I would argue adaptability and
resilience remain even more so
potentially is there anything in that
book Chris that that you'd take back now
or maybe that
isn't kind of as bold or underlined
looking forward the next three years
than maybe you wrote about at that time
so I think there's some I think there's
some things in the book that show its
age they're primarily around sort of the
world as it was then so for example we
had a whole chapter on Blitz scaling in
China because at the time the Chinese
startup ecosystem was thriving and there
were people like Mike morit around the
time Blitz scaling came out saying hey
if you want to understand what's
happening in the startup world you got
to go to China that's where it's all
happening and then of course
geopolitical events have occurred since
then the rulership of that country
decided to intentionally Crush that
sector so there are things that just
seem anachronistic as we talk about the
amazing power of scaling in China but
what I would say is through some pretty
crazy events a global pandemic the rise
of AI the lessons of Blitz scaling seem
to continue to apply right we did a
whole bunch of stuff during the pandemic
talking about blit scaling during the
pandemic and one of the things that aged
the best because we try to make these
calls publicly so that we can come back
later and say yes you know you guys were
right but one of the things we did early
on in the pandemic because we talked
about Airbnb and we said here's the
thing you have to understand about Blitz
scaling it is relative it is contextual
and so you look at Airbnb and you say
this is a company that has lost 100% of
its Revenue
overnight and that had to lay off 25% of
their people you know like how are they
going to recover and our response was
you know what they don't have they don't
have a bunch of leases and mortgages on
empty hotels that they've got to pay for
in fact the competition they're facing
is hurting even worse and if Airbnb
adapts to this new reality and gains
market share relative to their
competition during this period which
they should be able to do they're going
to exit this pandemic looking stronger
than ever and this was one of the great
calls of all time because less than six
months later the company was going
public yep yep I think one of the
misnomers with blit scaling people just
think it it means like higher bunch of
people like go higher and I actually
think like in the era that we're
currently in right now given that many
tech companies have gone through
significant layoffs if not one multiple
events over the last couple years and
now you're starting to see with AI like
Sam Alman said the other day you know he
believes the first billion dollar
company with one employee is on the
horizon the next 10 years what do you
think how does it relate to like the
number of people how do you think about
that and how does that apply
to Blitz scaling in your philosophy
around it yeah so I do believe that AI
makes Blitz scaling easier in some ways
because of the fact that individual
human beings can be much more productive
than before I think that it's possible
that there will be a billion dollar
company in the next 10 years with one
employee but I don't think it's going to
be a major Trend because AI can amplify
but there is still extreme value to
people working together and it may be
that those groups will be smaller than
before but it may be that there'll be
more companies than before so one of the
things I often do is I look to the past
and when I started my first company in
the 1990s to operate an internet company
you had to go and buy a bunch of very
expensive sun microsystem servers you
had to go spend half a million dollars
on Oracle software and you had to go pay
Exodus Communications or Global Center
$20,000 a month to host all those
machines and that was just what it took
to get started and today you can do all
those things on Amazon web services or
anything else for like 10 bucks a month
and what did that do did that mean that
companies no longer have data centers
everyone just operates off Amazon Ser
web services no it meant that we found
ways to use that additional productivity
so AI will dramatically increase
productivity but if we use that
productivity to make the world better
make better products make better
services
I have no doubt that we'll find a way to
consume it y I agree all right I'm want
to talk about picking companies so you
know obviously the success of an
investor is determined by how well they
can pick a company I think one of the
things that people don't think enough
about as it relates to their own
employment is that picking where you
work is going to be a huge determinant
of your Career Success do you think
there's overlap between what investors
should be thinking about when they pick
companies and what employees should be
thinking about when they pick companies
absolutely now it's not a complete
overlap but it's still very strong so
from an over overlap perspective the
fact remains that if you are part of a
winning team so many benefits ACR we see
this every year in the professional
sports world like the NFL is playing
right now the teams that are doing well
their offensive coordinators and
defensive coordinators will get hired as
the next head coaches the players that
are doing well we get a big contract
next year right being a part of a
winning team confers so many benefits
and so if you are an employee if you're
looking out for your own career
obviously you want to be on a rocket
ship not only because it'll provide you
with huge amounts of money potentially
but because it will accelerate your
career it'll be a huge brand value for
you it'll make all these other things
possible so as an individual employee
you should put on your investor hat and
try to figure out do I believe this is
going to be a massive success
now where there is not as much overlap
is the other thing you have to do is you
have to ask yourself who are these
people that I'm going to be working with
for the next X years that is really one
of the core reasons why you should pick
a company and it's not just because it's
going to make the company successful
because these are the people who you are
adding to your network who will be the
key collaborators that you are going to
work with in the future and I made
decisions based purely on that point we
were talking before we began recording
about our mutual friend David weekly so
I worked for David for a while and here
was what I told David when he asked me
to join and and help him out because I
told him I'm not looking to get a job
right now I'm supposed to be taking a
quarter off he like I need you I'm like
okay David here's how it's going to work
here is why I'm going to work for you
it's not for the money although I hope
that we make money here but what I need
from you is I need to connect with a
whole younger generation of
technologists because I know the VCS I
know many of these key business figures
I come from Harvard Business School and
all that what I am missing is that deep
network of people who are technologists
people who are on The Cutting Edge and
you David are really good at bringing
those people together so that's what I'm
looking for from you besides a salary
and he agreed to that and was good to
his word and that's how I met so many of
the people in the technology Community
here in Silicon
Valley wow yeah that that is such a
great way to think about you know people
it it's so it seems so trite after
listening to you talk like that to when
people are always like oh go work with
good people but for you it's actually
like you're you're essentially boiling
it down to what am I optimizing like
what is the gap that I need to like
really enable greatness and how can I
get this from the next place from the
people that work there that is so much
more specific and helpful for folks I'm
going to I'm going to think about that
one later Chris that's a good one Chris
in choosing you know these companies to
your point and I'll speak for myself
probably many others are listening to
this you know one of the big big drivers
is working with the founder CEO like
that person what is your you you know
work with them for years and years and
years and you've kind of studied them
for years what is your advice on how to
assess out what you're going to get
along with or that's the right founder
for you how how do you best assess that
yeah I think that you know my hack for
doing this is and it's not always
possible well my hack for doing this is
to say okay well let's go travel
somewhere together wow and the reason
for that is I find that people can be
very good at projecting a certain
persona but they become very challenged
at doing so after the 10th hour of the
flight or after you've been sitting in a
lounge for two hours or after you've
been stuck in traffic you start to see
who the person really is and I call it
the Camp effect another way to do it
would be to go to a summer camp but that
is something that it's hard to like get
people to agree to so instead I say
travel together but when you see people
under those circumstances where they can
no longer you know just put up their
their face and their Shields and where
you're seeing the real person then you
get a much better sense of do I want to
spend more time with it oh I wish I go
back in time and do that holy where
have you gone where have you gone who
who have you takeen where have you gone
and who have you who went with you
well so for example you know one of my
partners at Blitz Gilling Ventures his
name is Jeff Abbott and he originally
came into my life because he said hey I
need help I'm here at Arizona State
we're running a program with US military
I need to find a way to recruit
entrepreneurs and accelerate them and
have them take a look at military
Technologies and commercialize them and
so we agreed to work together and he
actually set up you know program and we
would travel together to San Diego or
Albuquerque New Mexico all these places
and spend time together working on
things and he would find a way to make
it happen even though there was not
enough time and not enough resources and
I was like okay this guy I see him under
the highest stress circumstances he can
still perform this is a guy that I need
to have somewhere working with me and so
that's how we ended up working together
and ultimately forming blit scaling
ventes I'm just kind of picturing if I
ever taken other cheap people officer R
saying you know I will only sign this
offer letter after we go to like Japan
together or something I don't know yeah
or or or take a road trip a road trip
would also work right you don't road
trip out into the Wilderness again the
tough part is making it seem like
there's a real business purpose behind
yeah absolutely so actually Kelly just
thinking of our audience so one of the
things I remember back in in 2012 2013
when I was at Google we were doing all
these like anti-bias trainings and and
one of the things that they were like
really clear on is like well you
shouldn't assess people what was that
that question of like can I can I spend
if our flights delayed 10 hours can I
spend 10 hours in an airport with this
person that was always like a red flag
like don't don't think of it this way
but Chris like you seem to be like no no
no like this is actually like giving me
signal an important signal on working
with somebody and this is okay right
this is legal because it's not about
whether you're hiring the person it's
about whether you're choosing to work
with them yeah got it look I I I I
totally understand the intention behind
the avoidance of that bias because it is
true that people feel most comfortable
with people who are like them and if you
apply that principle blindly then you
will end up hiring people who are like
you and whether that sometimes that
might be a good thing hey they also went
to Stanford University that seems to
work out pretty well but other times it
doesn't but this is a little bit
different right this is all about okay
I'm now decided that this person is
interesting now the last step is to
figure out can we actually work together
over that extended period of time yeah
it's such a good point I mean I I've you
know run into it myself in my own career
with you know companies I've joined or
been in a company it's happened to an
executive we've hired or coach others
who were like oh my gosh and one of the
biggest reasons a Founder CEO and
executive relationship does not work out
is because of the chemistry and the
Dynamics it's not because the technical
functional skill sets of the higher it's
like Oh I thought this person was
someone else and boom and so common well
we talk about it all the time right
Kelly like in interviews we all have
this veneer on and it's it's it's like
Chris we've gone Kelly and I've gone
super deep on this topic of like
interviews are just they're very
performative that's right and and in
fact like I don't know actually if we're
learning a whole lot of anything that's
actually necessary during an interview
I've heard you say before like the
actually the best way to get to know
somebody is to get to work with them and
just start working with them and that's
that's also our take but in a world that
right now is oriented around interviews
you have this veneer and this is where
the chemistry problem exists is like you
don't actually know who this person is
and how you're going to be able to work
with them especially in Tech when you're
going to face challenges and those
challenges are the things that
ultimately can either bring you together
and make you super tight as a team or
rip you apart and make you realize like
this is a this is a person that's an
absolute nightmare to work with Chris
one more angle on the founder angle for
me and I think this is a a juicy one
because we talk a lot about comp
negotiation and we've done a lot in
equity and all all that jazz but we
haven't heard what I think you know you
had written down and we talked a little
bit about is negotiating founder shares
when you yourself are starting a company
that's a whole another ball of wax and
how that works because I got to tell you
I don't have any clue either yeah so let
me explain how I got into this to begin
with so I started my first company in
 
convinced that by the time I graduated
in June 2000 the boom would be over and
that if I wanted to make a mark in this
particular boom I needed to do something
that and preferably start a company over
the summer and sell it before I had to
go back to school but you know didn't
quite work out that way I started the
company with one of my friends from high
school who fortunately for me and for
him had gone on to be one of the first
internet millionaires he had created a
company co-founded a company called
webcom that was a web hosting site and
it was acquired by vario which was
acquired by NT and he walked away as a
cash millionaire starting in like 1998
or so and so 1999 rolls around and we
decide we're going to start a company
together because we're good friends in
high school and I'm like I don't have
many other friends who are internet
millionaires this seems like a good idea
and but he was like but you know he's
like but listen I'm not the software
developer I'm the operations Data Center
guy we got a software developer so we
brought on board one of my friends from
Stanford who happened to be in my
freshman dorm who happened to be a
brilliant computer scientist who had won
all these Awards and things like that
and so that was my introduction so we
had this whole conversation which was
around okay well how much Equity am I
going to get and because you know first
was just the two of us Thomas and I we
just simply divided up 50/50 I told
Thomas I insisted you take no I think I
can't remember we insisted that one of
us take 1% more and I think it was
probably me that took 1% more because I
was originally the idea holder behind it
I was the CEO but then when our friend
My my friend Albert came in and we were
like we went online and we looked for
what you're supposed to offer someone
coming in and you said okay well how
about five% and Albert said well you
guys are super early and you're going to
go through a lot of dilution Albert was
a pretty Savvy guy I don't think that's
going to work I'm like okay let's think
about this let's figure out a system
that seems fair because the key to me is
decide on the process for making the
decision before you get to the numbers
because the numbers people argue about
numbers all the long but if you first
get them to agree to the process then
things will be better and so in that
instance what we did is we had a
discussion around well what's the right
ratio since you're coming in later on
what's the right ratio between the
Holdings of the two initial Founders and
your founder what is the level that will
feel fair to you and we sort of came up
with this ratio it should be roughly 3
to one and that's relatively arbitrary
but it's like okay we've agreed to that
then once we do that we do the math and
we say okay if we have 3x plus 3x plus
 
that your share should be this percent
and so that's where it ended up being
that's how we made that decision then we
extended it further because we at the
end of the summer I wanted to go back to
school and the people who were involved
the the like the the other board members
were like whoa whoa whoa we need a CEO
so we had to recruit a CEO to come
aboard recruited a CEO to come on board
and Jim who came in as CEO asked for a
certain amount and we agreed to it and I
think in his case he had asked for 10%
something along those lines and again
this is a pre-funded starter so that was
actually probably not enough and in fact
a month or so later Jim came back to me
said you know I think I probably didn't
do a good job of negotiating I think
that I probably should have had more and
I said well Jim we know we have a deal
but I'll tell you what go back and think
about it for a bit and if you come back
to me and tell me that you want to
change the deal we can look into it but
if not what I would just say is that
there's a long time to go in the life of
this company there' be other
opportunities to add you know stock
options and other things like that I
think that you you're going to do well
and we might just might as well just
wait and take care of it later because
if we open it up now we got to go to the
board and do all this stuff I think that
things will probably work itself out and
he went away and a couple days later he
came back and said you know I gave my
word and I think you're right so I'm
going to stick with what it is so in all
these cases the overarching principles
are decide on the principles not the
numbers the numbers come second once you
agree on the principles then it's easier
to come to agreement on the numbers it's
not always easy I've done things where I
had to get someone to agree they had a
piece of papers that said they had 25%
of a company and I had to get them down
as low as possible and I've had one like
eight hour conversation where I was able
to get someone from 25% to 6 per. wow I
mean 20s something years later has that
process become more formulate Chris
because the stories you're telling are
kind of like well this and that and I
mean has it become more standard or is
it kind of oh I think it's still very
much a wild wild west now look there are
better benchmarks thanks to companies
like ca that can show you how much
ownership people have but the fact is
those are still benchmarks every company
is a oneof one and you still need to
recognize people's feelings you still
need to get them to agree on that
process first and I think that that's my
overarching message decide on a fair
process and then it's easier to get
everyone to accept the outcomes yeah
yeah the process and principles I I love
that and Kelly this is why why companies
want to have a compensation philosophy
like how do we do compensation here
let's talk about that first before we
get into the numbers because once you
get into the numbers everything just
becomes like can I get more can you know
and you're you don't have any bedrock to
which to fall back on of okay like this
is this is the way that they do things
and there's a there's a method to the
madness and also like you're you know to
your point Chris around you are doing
deals with people we don't really view
like employment agreements as deals but
that's exactly what it is and when you
do a deal with another human you want to
make sure that the deal is based in
fairness and it has something of
substance underneath it and numbers are
not substance absolutely but I will
share one numbers hack that I got from
that CEO Jim Fitz Simmons that we
mentioned and it's this whenever we for
that company whenever we prepared a job
offer for someone we came up with a
package which you know it's typical
right here's a salary here's a stock
option package we would create a version
that was more salary heavy and lighter
on stock and we cre a version that we
created a version that was less salary
heavier and heavier on stock because you
don't know what a person's indifference
curve is and you doing your best to put
together what you think is fair but if
you make those three options along your
indifference curve and they pick one of
the ones that you didn't expect them to
pick you just create value I love that
Chris you're an absolute Legend thank
you so much for spending an hour with us
I I learned a ton from this conversation
and I know our audience is going to as
well thanks so much Chris well it is a
delight hopefully I was able to maintain
my energy throughout and please feel
free to have me come on again I don't
know if you've you know used up all my
fun of stories but we can always find
out I I I highly doubt that there's more
Riz to squeeze for sure you got it
squeeze that Riz baby thanks Chris
