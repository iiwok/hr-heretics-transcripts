hey everyone welcome to another episode
of HR Heretics I am so excited to have
my friend Anna bender on the show today
Nolan is traveling so it's just us gals
which is also exciting not that we don't
love Nolan but Anna Anna is great
everyone I've been trying to get her on
here what maybe for a year Anna and
finally made it work she's one of the
busiest people ever and I think we've
known each other since I think it was
 
over the 10year threshold now which is a
milestone we should go out and celebrate
that but Anna has been in the industry
for over 25 years I mean she was the
head of people at moft like in their
Heyday growth she's a board member a
venture advisor board member for culture
amp which is is an incredible company
and has been the head of people over at
a sa and I did a triple take it was like
almost nine years which is unheard of
which I want to get into but it's an
incredible incredible run at of which is
a great company so welcome to the show
Anna so excited to have you thank you so
much I'm so happy to be here full
disclosure I'm like looking up my own
LinkedIn right now because you just
threw out years and numbers where I just
I'm like when was that it's it's kind of
like having kids we like forget about
the whole experience after it's over
yeah I do that too sometimes with
LinkedIn we have a lot to cover today so
Anna you are a board member of culture
amp where we had dider on the show I
don't know if you heard that episode but
I think it was about three months ago
four months ago he's incredible that is
a great company I think we all if you're
in the industry you know it you use it
most likely how did that come about that
role well a few years before even met
did I I had sort of set a goal for
myself to join a for-profit business
board and I spoke to my boss Dustin
moskovitz about it at assana talked
about what the pros and cons might be
you know what the commit is and you know
I both wanted his advice and his support
and and just sort of liked his
co-creation on what might make sense and
we were definitely in um violent
agreement that it would be good for me
as an executive and in fact I think it's
really great for any executive to sit on
the board you know in in operating your
role you're so in the weeds you're so
trying to achieve your goals even an
executive of a public company you're
like you like you're in it and serving
on a board really helps give you
perspective and so I thought that that
might be the case so I set a goal and I
didn't have any timeline it's not like a
job right and it has to be the right
thing because it is a many many many
year commitment so I started to tell
people I did things like you know I met
with women particularly who were focused
on trying to place other women on boards
I talked to my own board members but
then I just sort of like waited and let
it unfold and it was it was actually a
great story because DDA reached out to
me he was looking to hire a chief people
officer and he felt stuck and he wanted
some advice I'm sure this happens to you
all the time right like people you and
say hey how should I think about my
search thinly veiled like not so thinly
veiled attempt to recruit you you know
but but that was the premise and we were
a customer of culture amp I was like a
long admirer of the philosophy and the
point of view and of so of course I took
the call and I've been at Asana now it
feels like you know a little while like
close to 10 years and I've been really
clear for a long time that this is this
is it I am staying here once I leave
here I'm going to be done with operating
roles so it's really easy to say no
right like it's just I know it's it's
really easy to say no to to operating
rules um but we were talking and and the
conversation evolved towards how I use
the product as a customer and like I I'm
in that product every single day it's a
products I couldn't do my job without
whether it is understanding performance
engagement now analytics you know before
I meet with any leader in the company I
look in culture amp and see what's going
on with their organiz ation and so this
was during the P pandemic and we were
talking and we were just about to wrap
it up and I just I said I said to myself
I was like I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do
it and so I took a deep breath and I
said listen buddy I love your company I
love your product I've really enjoyed
this conversation so if you're ever
looking for an independent board member
I would be really like honored if you'd
consider me and I'll never forget it
because I put put my zoom on mute so
that I would stop talking because I was
so nervous I was going to like keep
babbling and just like basically talk
him out of considering me and he was
there's one one silver lining of Zoom
right you could actually shut shut
yourself up in the moment zoom and he
was great he was like Anna you beat me
to it I am actually looking for an
independent board member and I'd love to
engage in the conversation so like it
just sort of falls into the category of
like you miss 100% of the shots you
don't take and I took that one and I'm
like I feel so I feel like I hit the
jackpot you know what's so important
about what you just said we've talked
about this on the show a lot on a and I
get this question all the time how do I
do this how do I get here it doesn't
matter what it is it could be a board
member or something else you take the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] call I I have people call me and
they're like can I get your advice or
help yeah sure they might be trying to
get them free yes take the call because
look at what that was that was not a
board member call at all and most of the
advising and even current clients I have
are not because they were calls where I
sought out to do those things no I 100%
when I think about the big moments in my
career I can like root them back to
relationships I built where like I
didn't have anything to gain I didn't
have any you know I just took the call
it's part of being a member of the
community and um you know it's really
interesting and I'll try to say this
carefully and if I screw it up you'll
edit me but one of the things that I
think might be a generational difference
in people coming up now and I've
literally gotten the question from
people that I work with like why you
know what are you going to get out of
that call and how do you do that
calculus and you know you only have so
many hours in the day and like well what
are you going to you know and I I don't
it it blows my mind right like you're
paying things forward in some which way
and if you can particip you always get
something out of the cult you always
learn something could not agree more
could not agree more and so let me just
dig into being a board member a little
bit because it doesn't matter if you're
a people leader or any business leader
once you get it right you're kind of
like oh great oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now what like what
do I do differently how does this work
and to your point you can't just like
quit the board seat it's not like an at
will I mean it is but it's not like it
could just just decide you don't want to
do it again one day so how what was
different how did you get good at it how
do you show up at these meetings or
prepare how do you interact with fellow
members like what's the secret behind
the sauce on
that I'll be honest with you so the
other thing that's strange about well
the other thing there's so many things
that are different about serving on a
board than operating you really you know
you really only engage
deeply a few times a year year right
like there's four board meetings a year
there's four comp committee meetings
there's tons of in between but like the
big moments are they're not that many so
I I probably for the first year I really
connected with my own deep and Loud
impostor syndrome because every you know
and of course I had met any of these
people who were all in Zoom they had all
been on a board together for a long time
they all knew what they were doing what
you know like Bankers CEOs you know and
Founders and like who the hell am I so
yeah you're like you all have been
boarding together forever and I walk
through a few different things that I do
to do the work and prepare first of all
I'm a very active operational leader
that is code for I get in the weeds and
probably too much in the weeds According
to some of the people that work for me
like I care about the details I sweat
them and so I have a little sticky pad
in my board notebook that says reminder
you're not an operator here right and
and it's it's a silly thing but I look
at it through each meeting like it's
you're not an operator another thing is
that board meetings at culture amp and
every other kind of tech company right
like you get a board deck right and if
it's you know sometimes it's really well
put together and sometimes it's not so
well put together and it's you know it's
more slides than you know what to do
with and I I don't know how else to say
it but you got to prepare right it takes
half a day to prepare for a two or three
hour board meeting and you know I print
the thing out I read it I take notes I
ask myself questions like I I do all
these things then I actually try to meet
with a couple other board meeting
members before the meeting that have
very different lenses than I do and ask
them what they see because it's just
like again you know different people
have different perspectives and some
people are coming at it with expertise
around funnel metrics or financial
metrics and not only do I want to
understand their perspective but I want
to learn so connecting with other that
was on my list because that can be
easily missed I'm on the board I have a
role I show up you know my assumption is
it's kind of like when you're an
operator you actually want to build
relationships with your fellow board
members and the CEO of the company so
how does that compare do you put the
same amount of effort into doing that
how often do you meet with these board
members what's it like that's a good
question so I meet with a CEO every
couple weeks depending on the topic
right so we've been deep in rebuilding
the executive team and I've been you
know I chair the comp committee so I'm
very involved in that to to like you
know Riff on different elements of that
the other component of it is like you
know is there any job more lonely than
being a CEO and so I think as an
independent member of the board I'm
there to help try to make it just one
click less lonely there's one other
independent on the board her name is Ry
sexina she is
incredible right like
we we compare notes on what we're seeing
we challenge each other she's actually
our lead independent and over the last
few years when there's been a couple
times where I haven't looked at my
little sticky note and said you're not
an operator and I've said something that
maybe was too operate she has called me
right up like right after the meeting
and said hey I think that I don't think
that was the right thing to say and
here's why and it's been incred like I
feel like she's got my back 100% and
we're you know like we're so aligned on
on the the north star of the goal of
helping make this company successful so
those relationships are critical yes and
you said something that I think our
audience and selfishly me frankly as
someone who probably wants to be on a
board one day I don't know but what was
that do you have an example of of
something you said that was Opera and
broke the Post-it Rule and what's the
right thing to say you do what I mean
what would she call you and say that was
a really great well I'll connect this to
something so the right thing to say is
always a
question how are you thinking about
X how are you thinking about
why what kind of impact might this have
what are the opportunity costs of this
one on a scale of 1 to 10 it's hard for
me to read you are you 10 out of 10
concerned or are you just like casually
mentioning this it like always the right
thing to say is a
question it's beautiful it's very very
simple now I'll connect it to there's
another board member an investor guy
named Nick kroer he's based in Australia
and he's you know he's had so much
pattern matching right like because he's
been on the board he's been on so many
boards he's very smart he's very fast
and one of the things that he taught me
is and it's it's not the best language
but it's really clear he's like
Anna every quarter every board meeting
I've only got one or two bullets I've
only got one or two things that I should
say that really really matter he's like
think about it GDA has eight board
members if they all have two bullets
that's 16 things right like that is a
lot he's like so unless it's really
compelling I try to stick it you know to
one and I remember I I'll never forget
we met for coffee in San Francisco
before on board meeting he's like so
what's your bullet and I'm like what are
you talking about you know and it it
just became so now I'm constantly
thinking what's my bullet yeah less is
more and perhaps the bullet is a
question yes the the qu the bullet is
always a qu always a question but you
only get like right like really land
that one it hearkens back to you know at
assana there's this is a company filled
with smart thoughtful introverts and
pasant Pand who's our head of
engineering is constantly asking
himself does this need to be said does
it need to be said right now and does it
need to be said by
me those are questions that I would have
never asked myself before a I'd just be
like of course this thing popped into my
head and I'm gonna say it so it's just
like I've become a more thoughtful
leader that's awesome that's really
smart thank you for sharing that around
boards I mean it's just myself I'm
curious too like what happens like
unpacking that a little bit more than
just the
mechanics hey everyone we'll be right
back in a moment after a word from our
sponsors I must admit I used to believe
that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR that is until my friend
Heather do who leads talented signal
fire told me to check out metav I got
into the product and was like Wow AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provide perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently high
quality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metaview changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out medavie head over to metav
view. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
Med's product experts tell them that me
and Kelly sent you or you could just go
to their website and get started for
free you'll be up running an AI enabled
in
minutes shifting a little bit now
because this story is incredible and I
think everyone's getting aot lot of
value is your experience and and your
fun at building mule soft like back in
the Heyday I'm talking like what year
was that that
was so I I mean I joined moft in 2014
which is actually when I think you and I
talked yeah yes yes that's right so we
talked you were at yes you were at moft
building I was at GitHub building those
were two incredibly intense time periods
for both of those
companies uh tell us about your
experience there let's dig into that a
little bit so m s and you know needs no
introduction you know an incredible
company fantastic technology amazing go
to market like when public then
purchased by Salesforce just really a s
like just a pure successful run the CEO
cared a lot about Talent he cared a lot
about how Talent came into the
organization he was you know and he put
his money where his mouth is right like
he didn't just give lip service to it he
was on almost every interview panel
right like he he really watched the walk
it didn't take long for the both of us
to realize that we really didn't agree
on priorities and philosophies Around
Talent and you know quite frankly at
we're all grown-ups and at the end of
the day if you've got an executive that
disagrees with the CEO guess who wins
right and it was you know it was both
one of the hardest things so I should
just like rewind and be really clear I
was like unceremoniously invited to exit
that company I was invited to leave I
think we call that getting fired and it
was um it was like simultaneously one of
the toughest things I've been through
professionally and it happened to change
my life for the better in so many
ways yeah so tell me because I think
it's so interesting Anna because I I I
venture to believe most of the people
that are listening to this or what not
have had an experience somewhat similar
I certainly have and when you're going
through it you feel like it's the worst
thing in the world like oh what I'm
failing or this or that like let's talk
about the moments leading up to how you
got to the
conclusion that you just weren't going
to see eye to eye like what were those
weeks or months or days looking like and
feeling like um yeah you know I think
that the human brain has an incredible
capability of like shutting out the
worst feelings in memor so it's like I
have to really connect to it um so I'm
not I don't mean to sound callous but it
I have to I connect with it a little bit
like intellectually but I remember
feeling really disappointed you know I
was um I was horrified that I got myself
into this situation before then I had
had like really like wonderful job
experiences and and in a hyper growth
intense environment like that like it's
so intense and so non-stop you barely
have a moment to breathe and you know I
also like I had a new family and I was
just like it was it was overwhelming so
I I remember feeling disappointed I me
remember thinking how did I let this
happen like I felt very uh I felt a lot
of agency and a lot of
responsibility um you know if I'm honest
I had some shame around not advocating
for myself more you know there were
there's some structural things about how
that executive team worked that I just
felt like we're discounting of women and
working mothers in particular and uh
yeah it was like I mean at one point I
knew it was going to end and it was just
a matter of like how is it going to end
you know when I coach managers here at
aanaa about terminating folks I kind of
have a like a rule of thumb like in the
moment anyone is going to be shocked
right because it's like a shocking thing
to be fired but really what can't be
true they can't be deeply surprised when
they go home that night and go to bed
and like think about it they better not
be surprised and I think that that was
true of getting fired at moft right like
I I was shocked in the
moment but like I knew it was coming
it's so interesting like thank you for
being so open about this
because a lot of folks aren't and I
think especially you know you tell me
what you think but in my experience
especially 10 12 years ago it was like
oh my God oh my God
now that I'm 15 16 years in Venture it's
like more common than not do you know
what I mean and because I I had a
similar experience and I was like H I
joined this company the whole game
changed very unexpectedly you know
investigation change CEO change I mean
the whole thing was like thrown up and
then a totally different ball game and
it wasn't a good ball game for me like
it just values matching Style
and I was young I think I was I don't
know 32 years old something like that
kind of my first real thing in Venture
and you're right these high
pressure high you know growth
situations you got to stick to who you
are because you can get lost very easily
and you know for others who whove been
through this and then you start to
self-doubt you're like why can't I fix
this shame all these things
and the biggest thing I coach people on
now is like look the the most of the
reason these C Lev execs or what have
you don't work out isn't because of
their technical or functional skill sets
it's usually because of a cultural
mismatch of values mismatch right
disagreement on the role or what that
looks like like and that is okay it's
totally and it
again massively successful company just
not the right place for me and um from
the company's perspective I was not the
right thing for that but it was you know
I imagine in reflecting on the learnings
right like immediately I just had to
like take a deep breath but one of the
things I did really
quickly is I told people I told people
what it happened I named the awkward I
gave it less power Silicon Valley is
Tiny so you know Silicon Valley the
concept and so I was like I'm not going
to make up stories I'm going to honor
the decision and I'm going to own it
uh and then I put my energy into my job
search right like I actually love
interviewing in an interview you get to
learn about a new business a new
executive team a new market and I'm just
a curious person about business and so I
saw it as a a real benefit and then I
will say like I feel like my life got
changed because two things happened
first of all as I was exiting you know
you're kind of like still there but
you're really totally irrelevant like
you have like no voice you like nothing
nothing but you know they still want you
around so that it looks
nice and uh I I'll never forget it it
was in December I think it's December
 
have that much to do so you know I
spotted a freckle on my leg and I was
like that looks a little weird I haven't
you sit down to pee many times a day and
so it's a place you see and I was like
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do the
responsible thing I'm not going to go
check it out well it turned out it was a
very fast growing melanoma that I had to
have surgery for really quickly and I'm
not sure that I would have given myself
that made that a priority in a different
chapter so that changed my life and then
the other thing that changed my life
This truly changed my life is Matt
Kohler who had been an old friend and an
old associate from Benchmark called me
and I took the call again because I was
you know just kind of on the beach yeah
uh and he said h I have a few
opportunities that I want to talk to you
about and I was like great great timing
let's talk you know like I'm going to be
out of a job in 10 minutes and he
started with a sa and like he he's like
you know he talked about the platform he
talked about reducing work about work he
talked about the longterm and the
mission and how special Dustin was he
talked about how assana had already at a
hundred people hired its first head of
diversity and inclusion and I was like
this all sounds amazing 100 people's a
little little you know you don't need
you don't need me like that that's too
early but that's interesting what else
do you have and he's like well why don't
you go talk to Dustin and then we'll
talk about the other opportunities that
I don't really have and I just made up
so um it's great it's great he's mat
Matt coher is like the best sales person
that I've ever worked with and then I I
met Dustin and you know 15 conversations
later here I am oh my gosh and so almost
nine years with a sauna I think this
puts you maybe at the top percentile of
executive ten years maybe the top I
don't know probably not the top but did
you did you know that when you were
talking with Dustin like H how did you
seek that out like what what did you do
during that interview process that
others can learn to make sure that you
didn't get there and 68 days in go oh
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what did I do um we did itely took
our time like when I say I I interviewed
at assana 15 times like I entered that
building 15 times as part of the
interview process over what time period
do you remember I think it started in
January and I I so the interview process
started in January and my job started in
May so yeah like a four solid months
yeah um and each time I you know
probably half those times I met with
Justin and um but you know I met 25
people it was it was a a thorough job
and did you drive that or did a SAA
drive that both I mean I was you know
what do you say twice bitten once I
don't know what that phrase is but I was
like I was very careful and and they
were very careful like this is a company
that had started with values and culture
and now that like even the concept to
them of like oh we're going to hand
these reins over to somebody to sort of
orchestrate that was um was wobbly and
it wasn't well broadly supported
internally right so they were incredibly
incredibly careful but I mean uh uh
there's so many things that I loved
about those first like first few
conversations first of all I was you
know was in the kitchen with my little
family my husband and my stepdaughter
and my husband's like well what are you
doing today you know and I was like oh
I'm meeting the CEO of a company called
ASA you can even say
right and he's like
a and um my husband ran he was a CEO of
a broker dealer at the time and he had
like 20 employees all over the world and
he's like he's like I he's like it's
open on my screen I use it every day to
run my company and so that was you know
so then I went Cho chot chot into my
first interview and Dustin and I
probably spent a couple hours that first
day just really talking about philosophy
building company Philosophy
and with a wide ranging conversation
covering lots of different things very
interesting and um I'll I'll never
forget what happened like late you know
later that night I got an email from him
he's a writer like he has a phrase that
like you know writing is thinking and he
wrote me a long
email um reflecting on our conversation
and saying hey I'm I'm so excited that
we aligned on these things and you gave
me a lot to think about on these things
and I just want toind you I think you're
really wrong about this thing you know
and it was just so thoughtful and well
written I still remember I showed it to
my husband and he grasshopper me you
know like he patted me on the head and
said little grasshopper you can go
interview for as many other jobs as you
want but you're gonna go end up working
for that guy and he was right oh my gosh
and
so yeah that that's a great story that
is a great story and we obviously still
working with Dustin there still here and
you all have gone through so many
Evolution I could just imagine cuz you
know one day at these companies is like
four so I can't imagine how many
Evolutions you've gone through how do
you keep up the stamina like what's the
trick in like getting through them and
having the interest to like want to keep
tinkering without getting tired there
were two things that really like in that
process no three things first of all one
of the recruiters halfway through the
process gave me some feedback and she's
like you seem to be a little bit
negative about your meal soft story is
like what's what is that
about and I was like so never mind um
like I loved it that she named it you
know she said hey let's unpack that
together and she was testing to see how
I took the feedback and how I engaged
and did I get defensive and because that
was so core to the values of the company
of like let's talk about the tough stuff
and I like that just um instead of
giving me hot flashes it made me love
the company so much more you know like
it was in fantastic so that's number one
number two this is going to sound like
such a silly Bal example but the offices
at the time were on Bryant Street in San
Francisco next to the Sports Basement
and every time I went there and spent
many hours there I went into the
bathroom many times and it was like you
know software companies are filled with
dudes like you it was all Engineers so
it was all dudes the women's bathroom
was curated and designed by people who
were very intentional about the user
experience like the things that you
needed nicely arranged clean like just
thoughtful and that is really how they
design the product right and to be able
to see that in the bathroom was really
meaningful to me especially I spent most
of my life in very male-dominated
Enterprise software you know meal soft
ironport you know I would have never
seen a bathroom like that and it it sent
a message to the women coming into that
building it was really really powerful
to me well you said earlier that you
like getting to details now if that's
not an example of that I don't know what
is that's a great story I noticed
everything and then the last thing I'm a
really big believer that your values
live in your calendar right like I don't
you know whether you make minimum wage
or you are a bazillionaire you know how
you spend your like wild and precious
life says everything about your values
and during the interview process I asked
Dustin I said I want to understand how
you spend your time and he started
talking and blah blah blah and I said no
no no no I want to see your laptop and I
want you to open your Google calendar
you did not I
did and he first he looked at me like
what are you crazy lady and then he
looked and then he's like that's a good
idea and he opened it up
it and he walked me through it and what
it meant and I think it showed me so
many things about the type of CEO he is
the things that he spends time on and he
explained the pros and cons of each he
had family time on there he had thinking
time on there he had his one-on ones
arranged in a way that allowed gave him
room to prepare for each one like I um
so I I highly highly recommend that that
that is an incredible hack and I would
venture to say that a lot of CEOs
wouldn't even know it was on there which
is a flag in itself what what's this
what's next what's this it's terrifying
that's
terrifying well I wanted to ask you
because I love this topic with you you
have actually a very controversial
recruiting philosophy or maybe
controversial to some and I'd love to
hear about it yeah I don't know if it's
a recruiting philosophy it is like a
management and hiring for for me
personally I think um you know some
people say like oh 90% is showing up and
I like I think maybe the next eight% is
like know who you
are and I am
successful to the extent that I am
successful I'm successful because I know
what I'm good at and bad at I am a
leader of thorough breads I am not a
developer of people so I everybody that
works for me could do my job and
probably could do it as well or better
than I can so I'm like I'm here to bring
the team together and get them excited
about the mission and like clear on the
goals but but these people run
independently and we might riff and
co-create but everybody that works for
me at a Sonet is like truly a thorough
bread it's kind of incredible I've my
whole life I've never had a team like
I've been able to develop or to hire
here and yeah that's I mean I I hope
that's terrible to say that I don't but
why like tell me tell me why you have
that like why aren't you a developer of
people I don't know maybe because like
deep down I'm like I wish that I was
like a very high functioning individual
contributor like I like to do the work I
like doing work and again I've got this
is not the only way and and certainly
I'm not advocating that you take my
route because if every executive did
that I think it would be a terrible
world and many of my colleagues that s
are exactly the opposite right like they
Thrive and grow and are like incredibly
excited about developing people and
succession and it's just not it's not
it's not where I get my energy you know
I love it I respect it I mean we talk a
lot about in the show that more
important than the answer so to speak or
the approach is Clarity of identity and
Clarity of who the hell you are that is
a better way to that's a great phrase
that's great that's great
that reminds me of when I woke up one
day and I was like I don't really want
to lead all these people any I want to
be in ic for a while it was incredibly
liberating it's okay to say it so um
that's great well I have one more topic
I'd love to kick around with you on
before I let you go and it's it's really
on the Dei front um you know independent
of everything that's going on right now
and we're seeing it we're reading it
we're seeing a lot of changes within
companies when you all of at of SAA have
really been at the Forefront you know
you are are considered one of the best
in this approach to this and have been
extremely committed to it and would just
love to hear kind of how that's evolved
what's gone really well what did you do
wrong and maybe just some personal
thoughts on what you think's kind of
happening in the market right now the
news you know we have like another two
hours and maybe wine um maybe wine so I
uh look look our work around diversity
inclusion and belonging is grounded in
the same thing today that it was 15
years
ago diverse teams that operate
effectively where people have a deep
sense of belonging and feel safe to
speak up and disagree up down and across
produce Better Business outcomes so the
reason that we invest in this is because
we believe that it drives BS Better
Business outcomes and if our business is
successful we will achieve our mission
there's like that is true today it was
true 10 years ago it will be true in the
future regardless of who's in the white
house or who is not in white like that
is a fundamental the next thing I I will
say like around it maybe this is just
like a little story you know like
anybody else doing this work you know we
would invest the dollars we would set
goals we would like track programs and
I'll never forget when you know I was I
don't know two or three years in and we
were nowhere we had like BL like we had
failed on all different kinds of fronts
and I I was almost in tears because we
tried so hard right and I I remember I I
was in a one-on-one with Dustin kind of
a little bit um demoralized around
it and he pulled up some of the same
data I was looking at but he just like
zoomed out and he's like you're looking
at like 12 months worth of data and he's
like like we have an we have a mission
at ass SAA that includes helping
Humanity Thrive he's like do you think
that you can measure helping Humanity
thrive on a 12 month calendar like you
got to zoom out like you can't get tired
yeah like set goals and then like you
know learn and iterate but he's like we
can't get discouraged he's like we got
to keep going we have to play the long
game so it reset me it reminded me and
then like over the years like again you
know I think other people have heard me
talk about you can build the right top
of funnel it's just a choice and last
week I was invited to participate in a a
training program at the New York Stock
Exchange turns out the New York Stock
Exchange has a program run by this
amazing woman who her name is Suzanne
Brown and she works to tra place people
from under represented backgrounds into
their 2,000 New York Stock Exchange
companies and I went to their training
program was filled hundreds hundreds of
women mostly women of color all on
boards or board ready and you know I had
a moment because I thought I could have
never been in this room this room
wouldn't exist in San Francisco this is
not a you know and these are people who
are on the boards of um you know auto
man manufacturing companies and you know
cleaning supply compan all all like all
of these industries and these companies
across the company that you and I like
they just aren't on our radar and it was
just such a reminder to me
like if you're not seeing if you're not
ex seeing what you need to see you're in
the wrong room get yourself in the right
room and I think that the same is true
of building your pipe in it
um one of the things that I wonder about
is employee referral
programs right and you take all that
money and put it into putting yourself
in the right
room maybe you'll have a different
outcome totally and I actually I love
what Dustin said about the long game and
I think
that I mean presumably he said it years
ago right because you've been there a
long time and to have said that years
ago was I think very very wise and very
different than what what we were seeing
with a lot of these companies doing kind
of window dressing stuff and quotas and
measuring the percents every six months
or 12
months and that's why you guys are still
sticking with it because well and it
means different things in different
chapters of your you know there's a time
where we were growing our headcount 30%
year-over-year like I had a lot of
leeway to do a lot of things not doing
that today but guess what we can build
sponsor ship programs to De to invest
and develop the people here and this is
you know sometimes um sometimes my
shortcoming is my fail the failure of my
imagination because I haven't like i' I
have a long tenure here that means like
there's three other companies I haven't
been at during that time so I've been
able to hire people who've brought in
their ideas from other companies from
larger companies and who've advocated
there's a guy named Mike Jordan who
works for me and he's like we can build
a sponsorship program to support these
um you know upand cominging people and
I'm like oh sponsorship programs those
are for big companies not like us oh my
God was I wrong it's like one of the
most successful programs that we built
everyone that has run through it comes
and finds me and says this changed my
life and it's GNA change my career so I
guess uh let's just ignore the noise
remind ourselves why we're doing this we
are in the business of business we want
to make our business is successful and
we can do that by playing the long game
on this work it's a nice time to kind of
reset and whiteboard it and go back to
the like the first principles versus you
know grabbing on to all the noise that's
out there and the latest thing uh you
know so I love that um Anna this has
been
amazing I have can I give a plug for one
or two other things I may have already
talked to you about this but um before
the pandemic hit I was in this little
thing called like a um uh an HR Supper
Club and it was
 
from different companies at very similar
stages of growth and life that assana
was and we used to have dinner together
on a quarterly basis and we just like go
around the room and like you know help
each other out yes um and then when the
pandemic hit we really got together you
know like there was that crazy month in
February probably talked every day we
were sharing all of our comms you know
we were saying oh I shut down Singapore
oh I shut down Vancouver you know like
and and the Google Docs were flowing and
over the like next two years we really
like we met weekly for two years when I
look at that group now my little my
little precious beloved Supper Club of
the 10 that started only two remain
people have retired they've moved out of
the the function you know some got
spectacularly fired some just said oh my
gosh I'm
done and I think that that's emblematic
of a lot of leaders and you know kind of
of Our Generation that have left the
field and I guess I just want to say an
encouraging voice like I think HR
leaders are Business Leaders that have
incredible impact yes it's sometimes
tiring but it is so impactful I love the
work out loud there are paths to do it
there are amazing communities that you
can build and I just I just want to
encourage people to enter the field not
exit the field I always say I it's one
of the hardest jobs out there but those
times you know those stretches where you
you get it right and it kind of
everything's clicking together there's
literally no better feeling and you're
just chasing that you're try you know
you're and it's it's a addicting it's
wonderful yeah yeah I agree all right
Anna well thank you so much my friend

have you back friend of the show tons of

vulnerability and your honesty this is
