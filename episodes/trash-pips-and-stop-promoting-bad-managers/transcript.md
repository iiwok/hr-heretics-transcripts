# Trash PIPs and Stop Promoting Bad Managers

## Transcript

 
all right Kelly so Jack dorsy who was
the CEO of Twitter and also the CEO of
block formerly known as Square just
decided to kill performance reviews at
the company and they did a couple of
things and I'll break it down and then I
want to get into it with you so he said
performance reviews actually don't help
us get better he said performance should
be continuously evaluated and feedback
should not be queued up for later I
don't think anybody disagrees with that
but we'll get into it uh he also said
that they still doing employer ratings
but they've simplified it down to three
ratings which is basically exceeds meets
and below and then they're also ending
Pips and what he said about that was
they don't actually work consistently
and they often feel way too late they
don't push the manager to give feedback
in a timely manner manag in a manner uh
it's lazy and often surprising that we
can avoid with direct and consistent
feedback so I'd love I have a lot of
takes on this I'd love to get your take
on what block is doing right now with
performance for sure I mean this is this
is
something oh my where this has been a
thing for at least my 24 years in HR
it's been you know up and down and left
and right you have Microsoft right years
ago with big announcements around
reviews no one's really figured this out
and frankly I'm not sure that that there
is one right answer
I really totally and then it will change
right things shift and change new
generations come up like I I I don't
think that the right answer is to like
search for and declare I totally agree I
don't think that there's one right
answer for sure but it kind of seems
like there's just a bunch of bad answers
today yeah yeah you know and I remember
the days when I was at at Yahoo and I
was young and I was riding my own like
lumbering annual once a year freaking
performance review and sap success
factors no less um and it was brutal I
mean that that's definitely the wrong
answer so maybe maybe it's easier to
start with the wrong wrong answers back
into it but in all seriousness I I think
that we've been starting with the
activities right you start with the why
so let's let's create the answer based
on what we want at the company that
we're at and the time that we're in and
yes everyone starts with the form the
Cadence like let's not start with the
activities and I think it will lead to a
better answer that's right for each
company I loved so I go back to our
episode with Steve and if anyone wants a
really hot take on performance reviews
go listen to the episode with Steve
kigan who is the former chro of Linkin
and he he told us a story about all of
the executives hating the performance
review process and Steve was like great
like let's throw it out and people like
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like what do you mean
throw it out and it's so weird that we
get attached to these things that we've
invented but once we start doing them in
a regular Cadence throwing them out
feels so radical when it's just if we
just run all these things like an
experiment and look at it and it's not
working here's my take I think the
current annual performance review
process that is copied by 90% of compan
optimizes for shitty managers and
lawyers that are worried about liability
and so like the lawyers that are worried
about liability I just think like don't
even listen to these people like they
shouldn't be a part of the conversation
we should tell the lawyers this is what
we're doing help us make that happen but
I don't think that they should actually
be part of the design process because
they're always going to optimize for
safety so don't include them until it's
really baked then bring them in and say
great how does this look from your end
so that's how I think about the lawyers
the shitty managers the shitty managers
though Kelly is like this is the thing
that I I think is the reason we have
this process is because we use annual
performance reviews as a back stop to
make sure managers are delivering
feedback and I just feel like that
problem can be solved a thousand other
ways that are more productive for the
manager and for the
yeah on the lawyer side I will push back
lawyers can actually be helpful it's
kind of like HR people there are shitty
HR people that you don't want to include
in anything and there are HR people that
actually help you get there faster and
think of shortcuts or ways to bend the
rules so it depends on the lawyer man
like because of course in these early
stage companies it is a blood bath I
mean there could be a hundred lawyers in
a company if you don't do it right that
still can't clean up the mess so there
there is that versus here's what we're
doing doing help us get there because
that can be a recipe for disaster so I
think it's a balance I think it's a
balance I do um but let's let's talk
about Pips and reviews I do agree they
are crutches enforcing functions back
stops whatever you want to call it to
elicit behavior that we want which is
feedback and direct feedback on a
regular basis okay that is a skill that
that a lot of people frankly don't have
at all so I do understand that you need
some kind of training wheels depending
on the situation because that's how we
work right you can't just get rid of
them because they're stupid and shitty
and expect it to happen that's that's
the chasm that you have to like figure
out how to how to cross and maybe that's
like you said iterative steps maybe it's
phases it's not all or nothing or answer
one or answer two maybe it's answer one
for six months then we're going to go to
answer two maybe it's answer one for
this cohort of people then we're going
to go graduate them like we haven't
really experimented with with different
different structures in companies
depending on the segment of people it's
all or nothing I actually have I've
tried it a few times I also tested uh
 
just like a continuous feedback tool I
found it amazing but what I learned is
is when we tested it with the
engineering team they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated it
and they felt like it was a bigger tax
on them and the reason why is because
they were still thinking well I still
have to do this annual review at the end
of the year and so I I do think if
you're going to do continuous feedback
you have to go all in on that path or if
you're just going to do like the once a
year thing like the trade-offs are
nobody's going to get feedback until
it's probably too late and so either way
there is a tax Associated but I view
that tax as healthy to ensure that
employees are getting feedback now the
the biggest point I want to make I think
that there's so many managers that are
managing people and they shouldn't be
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] near management and so it
doesn't matter the amount of training
you can give these people like you can
sync tens of thousands of dollars into
somebody and the reality is they're not
cut out to be a manager correct we just
want to force these people to be
managers or we create these career paths
that basically the only way you can
Ascend is to be a manager and the
reality is is most people aren't cut out
for management always say everybody
wants to be a manager until you are one
and it's like then it sucks yes and so I
I honestly think going back to our
conversation with tomash I think that
the future is going to look a lot more
like very large spans of control to
where today you typically have call it
like somewhere between four and seven
direct reports I think the future is
going to look a lot more like you have
like 15 to 20 direct reports and then a
hell of a lot more ic's who are actually
doing work and not focused on the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of managing people well yes so
small spans of control very structured
management a lot of rules right that's
almost like school that's like the
teacher and the child whatever it is so
if if you have great hires at the IC
level that are adults I don't care if
they're entry level or senior they're
adults they're responsible they're
Achievers they're taking learning upon
themselves they're not blaming their
manager HR for career development like
they're responsible adults that are
doing great work they ask questions they
raise their hand they say no or I
disagree like all of those things then
you have an adult as a manager who is
talking like we talk right every day I
didn't like this why did you do this
right direct which is hard for people to
do but if you have that mixture you're
golden like and imagine that with 10
people and you're one of those managers
you don't need a bunch of Pips and back
stops and legal phrases and it's just
but that that might be as you call me a
utopian State like it doesn't
exist but that is that is the goal right
that is the goal at least for me in
cultures I try to build teams I try to
build absolutely teams I try to work
with and it just kind of makes all that
easier if you don't have that
mistrust
anxiety like lack of direct feedback it
justs it's the worst it's the worst
working environment it's the worst and
elicits where you got to throw that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and down do a pip and it's got to be
structured believe me I wasn't into it a
long time ago my my job like my first
like hrbp job entry level kind of thing
I literally word Smith Pips like half
you were ahead you were ahead of C I was
head of Pips and frankly I was pretty
good at it but it's the phrasing and the
words and when you're doing that stuff
that is a lagging indicator that
something went wrong Upstream so let's
solve for those Upstream and if you do
that you can use less structure
Downstream tot I couldn't agree more the
the one thing I one of the things I
learned at door Dash so we had we did
this the thing that everyone does which
is you take your best ic's and then you
promote them to managers and then six
months later these people are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
miserable and you're not getting as much
output out of your team and you're just
like what happened here yeah so we took
a step back and what we did was we
created uh dual paths on the career path
track so like I I's were paid as much as
manager so there wasn't salary um
discrepancies between the the the two
different tracks and the other thing we
did is we created kind of this like
intermediate step between the two tracks
and we called it a elite and the idea
was look everybody is curious about
management like that is true like if
you've been in ic you don't know like I
maybe I will be a good manager maybe I
won't be and how can you create the step
to to where it's not as scary to to
chest it out and so what we did is we
would basically put people that were
ices who wanted to be managers that were
high performing that we thought had the
ingredients to be a good manager into a
lead role and the discussion was we'll
let you test this for three to six
months and we're going to give you a ton
of feedback along the way and our
expectation is is that you're giving us
a ton of feedback on does this give you
energy or not and if you don't like it
or we feel that you're unfit to do it
will just move you back to being an IC
and it's not like this like scary thing
it's just like hey like let's go
experiment and test yeah you don't you
have one foot in the pool you can always
get out not in the deep end like dying
and then you have to
leave so first of all if you don't have
dual tracks and a lead type role you you
got to have that I've known I've known
nothing but that for like 20 years like
 
equally that's a problem because of that
Force function into management y now the
thing I will say that that is the
real difficulty and I I empathize
especially with early stage companies
that are just running and burning at
both ends everything you just said is
Utopia and it takes the biggest thing
that people don't have in these
companies is
time like it has to has to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be a
tops down this is important otherwise it
just won't happen and it never gets
rewarded never like dude it a part of
your incentive programs make it like a
thing because I don't think good
managers get rewarded enough and I don't
think bad man get thrown out enough I so
well said Kelly and and just to like
double down on that point you're exactly
right that like CEOs end up optimizing
for like right now we need to solve a
problem and they're completely missing
the forest from the trees which is like
well if you invest in these people not
only will they be able to solve that
problem
then they're going to be able to solve
the future problems I think a lot of
CEOs believe that you could just recruit
your way out of all of these messes yes
and it turns out that like you don't
know what you're getting when you're
recruiting right you don't know if
they're gonna they're going to actually
operate like you want them to as as part
of your culture and so if you have
people internally that you can lean on
and grow and invest in there is no
better use of your time yes the the
amount of money and time
and like you know holding the business
back that it takes to get rid of someone
hire someone new ramp them up have them
understand the nuances and how the cloth
is of the culture I mean it literally
wases millions of dollars and people
don't think about that because it's not
you can't account for it yeah you can't
ex because it's Iceberg underneath the
water that no one freaking thinks like
Jesus why are you missing numbers well
like I'm telling you the the people in
the organization it impacts your
business more than you ever know and
it's like a Deadly Secret Weapon yeah
you can't see it you can't account for
it but it's so real and and I will tell
you Nolan like we talk about these in
all of our segments like how to partner
with CEOs in these very aggressive very
competitive very high pressure companies
you can't just be like well they don't
get it and they're like you have to
empathize like of course they're under
you're a CEO right of a company and
especially in this macro you have to
start with where they are and then move
it you can't just point at them and say
you're wrong and you don't get it
there's so much pressure and there's so
much that I've felt myself in this role
for 14 years with Founders CEOs multiple
yeah and so you have to empathize with
why they're feeling like that so I'll
end my my shtick with the bottom line
for me with all of this stuff Pips this
is start with the why not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
activity don't start with changing or
adding or subtracting activity start
with can you explain it on why you're
doing it can you talk to the C company
at at all hands and explain if you can't
do that easily then don't do anything
yet figure that out first and and be
okay with framing it as an experiment
and be okay doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that makes sense
for you that may not make sense for
Google or Facebook or any other company
it's dependent on the context of the
organization in which you're working so
we'd love to hear your feedback on this
let us know what you all are doing at
your companies and let us know if you
guys want to go deeper on any specific
topics
