For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, Kelly and Nolan talked to
Culture AMP CEO DDA Elzinga, revealing
datadriven insights on building culture
first companies, balancing psychological
safety with accountability, and
prioritizing growth as engag Engagements
Foundation.
&gt;&gt; What's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today we
have a special guest, Ddia Elzinga, who
is the CEO of Culture Ramp. Everybody
knows what Culture Ramp is who listens
to this show. You guys are an employee
experience platform. As I was doing my
research though for the show, I learned
that you actually worked in film and
most specifically on Harry Potter
movies. So, Diddier, how do you go from
working on Harry Potter movies to being
the CEO of Culture Amp?
&gt;&gt; Nolan, um, Kelly, I'm delighted to be
here. Um, and that's obviously a
question I get asked a lot. So, little
quick background. I'm a software
engineer by training. I fell into a
small post-production company. I was
employee number four or five. And over
 
actually CIS admin, software engineer,
artist, CTO, and then CEO. And I ran
that company. I got to this point where
I'm like, I don't know if making the
next version of Expendables
is really the difference in the world
that I want to make. I became good
friends with Mike and Scott at Atassian,
watching them build their business, and
I'm like, you know, their business model
looks a way better than my business
model. And I kept coming back to people
and culture because I realized that was
actually the thing that drove me the
most, which is how do you bring a group
of people together and try and do
something really difficult and do it in
a way that you can be proud of. And so I
I used to joke and still do joke that as
a CEO you're a glorified psychiatrist. I
wanted to build software to help that.
And Culture Amp was born. And so that's
the mission for us which is to create a
better world work. And here almost 13
years later I'm still here. I want to
talk about uh you call it a culture
first company. You said the real test of
culture is when things don't go to plan.
Why should you invest in your people?
Because when things don't work, they
will invest in you. Can you tell our
audience like what do you think are the
important ingredients in a culture first
company?
&gt;&gt; Culture first doesn't mean culture over
everything else. There's a a phrase that
my wife uses which I really like which
is a culture first company validates the
human being while asking more of the
human doing. And so organizations that
you would probably say aren't culture
first may be amazing because they demand
really high things. They have really
high standards. They push really hard
but they break people because they
literally don't see the person as a
fundamentally important component. They
don't see the culture as a fundamentally
important part. Equally places that are
like we're just a really nice place to
be. we're all good friends. They don't
produce great work either. So there is
the culture first piece is in the middle
and it's about understanding in the long
run performance
is your culture. I learned something
from there's a NBA player Shane Badier
and he has this thing which he calls a
coherency matrix and so you have on one
axis trust psychological safety you know
broad sense of what we would consider to
be a good culture and on the other axis
you have mission orientation and you
know you everybody being focused on
achieving an outcome and similar to what
I was saying before if you are fully
focused on achieving an outcome but
there is no trust it's a miserable place
to be and people break If you are fully
focused on creating all the trust, but
there's not enough mission orientation,
you get a slipping standards where even
good people aren't producing at the
level they used to produce because not
everybody's actually pushing in the same
direction. But his insight that really
resonated with me is that top right that
we all want where those two things are
both in train is not a stable state.
It's that you will constantly fall off
and you have to figure out how to pull
yourself back up. And so for me, that's
what a culture first company is. is
constantly writing that line down the
middle and understanding what it means
and being very intentional about it.
&gt;&gt; You founded Culture Ramp over 15 years
ago. Like I I'd love to know through all
the ups and downs, the changes, the
chaos, the evolution, what has remained
extremely true through it all? Like what
what's the data that was true 15 years
ago and is just as true today from your
perspective?
&gt;&gt; So one of the key things we look at is
engagement. The strongest longest
correlation to engagement has always
been this is a place where I can grow in
my career. This is a place where I can
develop. And so
the thing that I feel has never changed
is both the need and the importance of
growth. And I think one of the reasons I
started Culture Amp was this realization
that for better or for worse, work is
increasingly how we create meaning in
our lives. So I feel like we have an
obligation to create workplaces that
give people more positive and and more
powerful identities and the key to that
is growth and the data underpins it. You
create an environment where people are
growing. Just if I can quickly share
some data um you know on this that whole
um question about leaders and managers
we actually went and looked at it in the
data and so we looked at people that
perceive themselves to have a good
manager and people that perceive
themselves to have a good or a poor
leader. So if you have a good manager
but a poor leader what do you think is
the percentage likelihood that you will
stay?
&gt;&gt; 60 something 60s something
&gt;&gt; it's 38. Now, if you have a good leader
but a poor manager, what do you think it
is?
&gt;&gt; 60.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 60. So, it's the exact opposite.
It is actually more important for you to
trust the leaders in the company than it
is to trust your your direct leader, a
direct manager. Do you want to know
something even funnier? Um, so if if you
if you have both, so you know, good
leader, good manager is 89% and poor
leader, poor manager 22. That data was
from 2017 when we ran the first
analysis. We just reran it to see what
happened. So over the seven-year period,
the poor leader, good manager has stayed
basically the same to 37. The poor
manager, good leader has gone up 16
points to 76. So it goes back to what we
were talking about just the difficulty
of the world right now and how important
leadership is. I either see leaders who
intrinsically understand that there is
uh economic value and business value
when they grow their teams
or they don't and they just in just
immediately start to rely on recruiting
like what are you learning on how to
influence these people who don't
intrinsically understand it?
&gt;&gt; Oh wow. There's so many things in that
that I I want to pick up on. My somewhat
heretical answer is don't bother. Like
enough people get it that it's not worth
wasting your time trying to convince the
people that don't. Like honestly, just
just go find some people that do and go
work with them. But when we think about
the data side of it and what we can
bring to bear, what I'm actually really
excited about is we're just starting to
see enough data that we can draw some
really interesting conclusions. Having
next to no difference is an incredibly
strong predictor of share price
performance.
&gt;&gt; We did our own bit of data showing the
the impact of implementing a structured
performance review. What we did see was
that on a range of factors for men it
made no difference to their perception
on workers my role is evaluated fairly
work is handed out properly you know I
have opportunities for growth and
development you know important factors
on somebody's view but for women it
eradicated the historical gap so there
was about a 10 percentage point gap
between the men and women when you
looked across all of our customers and
after they implemented structured
performance review process that shrunk
to about 2 percentage points. That's
huge. I think what we can do is we can
bring data to try and debunk myths. We
did some work years ago um actually with
Salesforce and we were looking at their
teams and looking at uh sales managers
and people in their teams and engagement
and we did some analysis and we were
able to show that the strongest
correlation for performance of that team
and quotota achievement was whether or
not the people in the team perceived
their sales manager to believe that
people were important. And that was
incredibly powerful data because it
allowed the people team to go to all of
their sales leaders who didn't want to
come to any of the training, didn't want
to do any of those things and go, "Hey,
I know you don't want to be here, but I
just wanted to point out to you that the
people that make more money than you,
this is what they do. Now you have
people's attention."
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it.
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
which uh let's just put it out there.
That sounds pretty boring if you think
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
prevention training, not very exciting,
right? We are very lucky in that we are
in the HR tech space. That's required,
right? Harassment prevention training is
not really optional. You need it. The
question is, who are you going to use
for it?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You're doing this training
whether you want to or not. But here's
what she told us about the impact.
&gt;&gt; The amount of impact that I've been able
to have from the HR perspective has been
just huge. It's phenomenal. We're doing
all these amazing things that quite
frankly too many companies don't do
because they don't understand the power
of their HR team. Instead of boring
check the box training that everyone
hates, Athena delivers content that's
modern and impactful. We're talking 200
plus courses in 100 plus languages with
a 93% learner positivity rating to back
it up. They take on all the tough
topics, harassment prevention, workplace
violence prevention, code of conduct,
and make them actually engaging. And for
HR, it's effortless. Training runs on
autopilot with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
Done right like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

Get 10% off of your first year. AI
change is how work gets done. Recruiting
is no exception. Metav is the AI
platform purpose-built for recruiting.

adoption and see real impact from intake
to offer, it's a no-brainer. Metave
suite of AI agents works for you at
every stage of the hiring process. Their
platform powers instant job postc
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently high quality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metav changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing

I love what you said around the data is
like the start of this. I just want to
accent that because I've been a part of
so many companies where oh my god
they'll take the thousand person report
and go away you know alone behind the
curtain dissect it and do all these
perfect hypothesis and they don't talk
to anyone and it's like listen the data
can take you so far let's not do this
unless we're actually going to get
underneath it and have these honest
conversations which is which is the in
my experience the the most important and
hardest
part of this process process and the one
that's usually least followed.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you talked about ESTB before
and and you know, we've been fortunate.
I asked her, we're talking about empathy
and accountability. And I said, what do
you think is the biggest challenge today
for leaders? And she said, I think we
have a generation of leaders that don't
know how to embody accountability. She
went on and she talked about it's to do
with parenting. It's to do with all
sorts of bits and pieces. She said like
if you have a child, you have your
 
chocolate donut and you don't think they
should have one because it's not not
healthy or whatever, it's your job to
say no and it's their job to be upset
about it.
And I'm like, actually really love that.
And she said, but in organizations,
we're not very good at that. We're not
good at being able to do that part. At
the same time, you still have to be able
to have create that space. And I think
what's so powerful about like an
engagement survey or something is it's a
way of creating space to have a
conversation that you're obviously not
having. And then the data helps you
realize we're not having this
conversation that we really need to be
having. Now you have to go to humans and
you have to actually learn to listen.
&gt;&gt; That's actually one of my core learnings
of like I remember using culture amp you
know I'm a first-time CPO. like let's go
get culture ramp like let's go deploy
this and then we hear a bunch of
from employees that I was completely
unprepared for. Then what I did I think
I made the this is where I made the
critical mistake is I tried to build the
people roadmap to address all of the
concerns of the employees versus taking
a step back and saying like okay this is
what we're hearing from our employees.
What do we stand for? like what does
this company stand for and where do we
want to be going? And I think that's I
that experience made me a detractor of
engagement surveys, but I think it was
actually like my execution after the
survey was in and letting employees
basically run the people team roadmap.
&gt;&gt; 100%. I'm so glad you said it that way
because it it in a perfect world, you
have a strategy like that's why you're
the CPO. you you pull together all these
things and it's a signal that you go ah
these bits of my strategy are working
and make sense. This doesn't tally
either I'm not executing or maybe my
strategy is not the right part of the
strategy here or whatever but like it's
it's an input but it it shouldn't set
your strategy. It should feed into it.
and Anna um Anna Binda who's on my board
uh she's the CPO at Asana and she has a
great quote which I love it is feedback
is not a gift it is a workout it's this
idea that like feedback is like a menu
in a restaurant
so you kind of look through the menu and
you go today I'm going to eat the fish
and I'm going to have the vanilla slice
but yeah if you if you try and eat the
whole menu oh my god
&gt;&gt; yeah da I mean you you've doing this for
so many of us, you know, over the years,
like how do how do you run Culture Amp?
What are your like what have been your
non-negotiables over the past 15 years?
How did you protect that through scale?
Like what's your what's your deal? What
what do you what do you stand for and
kind of, you know, fall on the sword
for?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I love it's such a
continuing um education
in all of that. uh because you know
we're a thousand people now just under
um uh I mean the values are at the heart
of everything. So our our first value is
have the courage to be vulnerable and
that's been a really big learning point.
So both in the positive affirmation of
that in terms of what does it mean to
actually create space where you can be
that and create an environment where
people do that but also realizing that
to to quote Bnee Brown um vulnerability
without boundaries is manipulation. And
so you know it's not just unfeted
vulnerability. It's not somebody coming
in and dumping on their manager issues
they have at home that that manager is
not equipped to deal with. That's not
vulnerability. But vulnerability is
about creating a space where
uh you get to be more of yourself.
You get to fail.
You get to not try and pretend that
you're always right. And that leans into
growth. So for me, you know, have the
courage to be vulnerable is the first
part of growth. We have learn faster
through feedback. Um trust people to own
decisions and amplify others. trust
people to own decisions is the hardest
value for us because everybody reads it
as an autonomy value whereas it's
actually an accountability value and so
there's a whole dialogue on that. The
things that have always been true for
me, it goes back to this growth thing.
Like one of the lines that I use a lot
is if we're thinking about someone
internal versus an external candidate.
The way I like to think about it is
where do we think that internal
candidate will be 6 months from now?
That's the person we should be
evaluating with the person we're trying
to hire. Because it's going to take time
for us to hire that person. It's going
to take time for that person to come on
board. And in a way we want to bet on
that momentum and that potential. We
want to look at this person and go you
know in six months this person could do
the job. And so I think if in six months
the person could do the job you should
go with the person internal like I want
to be culture have to be a place where
you do on the whole not everybody but on
the whole you do at least two steps
because otherwise we're kind of wasting
that potential.
But something I had to kind of come to
was when I thought about growth early
on, I had a conversation. I know we were
a couple hundred people and we were
talking about commitment to growth. And
then somebody said, "Yeah, but not
everybody wants to be growing in their
role. Sometimes people are just quite
happy where they're at and for their own
life. You know, there's other things
that are more important to them than
work and stuff." And so we shouldn't
always be striving for that. And I
thought that's very true. Uh and I agree
with that.
But then as years went by, I went
actually we can't be that company for
both of those people. If we want to be a
company where people are really going to
grow grow and have an opportunity to
grow, then we have to be committed to
that all through. And we just have to
say to people, it's not like you're not
going to get to stay here if you
plateau. Like everybody plateaus, but
you shouldn't come to Culture AMP if you
just want a job that's second place to
other things in your life. Like I always
say to people uh we borrow our time at
work from people or things much more
important than the work is even if
you're a workaholic and I am and it's
fundamentally important to have that and
I never want any work to ever come
before someone's family or health. But
I've had to learn that for us to be the
company we want to be to build the
product we want to be to be what we want
to be for people that are coming here we
also have to be willing to say we're not
we can't be everything for everyone.
This is going to be a hard place. It's
going to be tiring. It's going to be
challenging, but you will grow. And
that's the commitment that we're going
to make. So, that's a thing that I've
kind of doubled down on as as we've
grown. Um, and then the last thing is I
knew it coming out of Hollywood. I've
had it hammered into me in um in Culture
Amp, and it's the thing I believe to my
core is that storytelling is the most
important skill as a leader. And so, how
do we teach leaders and and managers how
to tell stories? Because I think that's
the the biggest skill that they need to
be able to be effective.
&gt;&gt; So funny. I mean, I uh one of my good
friends, Remma Singh, is the head of
people over at Pixar, which ironically
is another, you know, film making, and I
had coffee with her recently, and she's
like, it just gets hammered into us from
day one. It's storytelling,
storytelling, storytelling. So, maybe
it's the film. I I don't know what it
is, but that just connected for me.
&gt;&gt; My old boss, Henry Ward, CEO Okarta, one
of the best things he ever gave me was
the presentation skills of Steve Jobs.
Um, which like took me down this rabbit
hole of like, holy like there's an
art to this thing. So did you how do you
how do I I totally agree and I've I've
now become like so obsessed with
learning how great storytellers do it
and breaking it down to like its essence
because it has such a powerful impact on
humans. How are you doing that with your
employees and with your managers?
&gt;&gt; I mean lots of obviously you give
training and support and you you create
that that forum but there's two parts to
it. The first part is the skill and you
can learn that like in learning how to
tell stories and there's lots of
resources out there. The other part and
this is where the first value the first
value is so important is the thing you
learn in Hollywood is um there are only
a few kind of key stories. So the hero
with a thousand faces you know all of
the kind of comparative mythology stuff
and one of the most powerful stories is
the origin story. Where did I come from?
And so often when I'm working with
somebody it'll be like what's your
story? like you may not have the sk you
know the the refined presentation skills
but you can tell an authentic story that
nobody else can tell and so if I go back
to the early days of Culture Amp Edu was
one of our first um salespeople in the
US and he'd actually we we'd got to know
him at Chase he was working at Chase and
he'd actually been helping us as we set
up all our accounts and then he'd gone
to success factors and he applied for a
job uh at Culture Amp and we ended up
hiring him as one of our early sales
guys and so my story when I'm telling
the Culture stories I used to work in
Hollywood and I was a CEO and blah blah
blah. And so he would tell a version of
my story. And I said to him, you know,
that's that's your that's my story. You
you should come up with your own. And so
the story that we came up with, which he
would use, is he would go sit across the
table from a CPO and he would say,
you know, I've been at Culture Amp now
for six months, but before Culture Amp,
I was the person you used to send those
surveys to. I worked at Chase. I worked
at Success Factors. I worked in these
companies. and I would get these things
and this is what I wanted you to hear
and this is how I wanted you to listen
to me and this is which is why I'm now
here and so like it's that like you just
help people understand why are they here
and how can they connect in an authentic
way to the people around them
&gt;&gt; and I bet he closed a lot of deals
&gt;&gt; he was very good he was a he was he was
a very good sales guy
&gt;&gt; uh did he we've been doing this now for
uh for almost like 16 18 months and this
is one of my favorite conversations so
so far. Thank you so much for the time.
This was a blast.
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you for having me. You had me
you had me at the podcast title like
Heretic. I love it. It's uh the I think
that's the thing we have to do more than
anything is just keep fighting a good
fight and saying to people the way
you've been told it should work may not
be the way and the way that you feel in
your heart might be and we can help you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that. Thank you so much,
Diddy. I appreciate it.
