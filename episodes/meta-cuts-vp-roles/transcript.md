# Meta Cuts VP Roles

## Transcript

 
all right everybody welcome back to
another HR Heretics segment today we're
going to talk about meta and they
currently have 300 VPS Kelly they Mark
has has come out sounds like privately
in staff meetings and saying that they
are moving into permanent efficiency
mode they're going to cut at least 50 of
these VPS and they don't they don't
anyone any longer want managers managing
managers so what's your take on meta
this new push for efficiency which
sounds a lot like the old push for
efficiency that we got you know 12 18
months ago what do you
think right yes so I mean efficiency
it's it's funny that the the year of
efficiency initiative I think it's it's
more of the same Nolan like look I think
we talked about this with Google a while
back and people being shocked at you
know the safe happy warm place and it's
it's not like that anymore and I think
the hard thing for me though with meta
is this is like the fourth round you
know so it's kind of like what are we
doing here make up our mind do it I know
it's hard to do it at once however I do
empathize you know that is a tough place
to be in and a lot of anxiety right even
if I know some employees are you know
entitled or they thought it was the safe
place forever or they're you know
high-profile high level at at these
companies but it is difficult when it's
kind of multiple cuts across a year that
that is a tough place to be in and so
for me it's it's almost like the big
question for me Nolan is where else do
you go like we talked about staying
hungry we talked about you know kind of
always going out there you know your
stomach half full and working hard and
networking and hustling I don't believe
a lot of these people have done that for
sometimes double digit years yep that's
exactly the way I've been thinking about
it Kelly I think there's like a couple
threads to pull on so first let me take
the employee side and so you know the
the promise of big tech one of the
promises of big Tech is safety in
addition to you get to work on scale
problems and other cool things but in
general like you have job security you
don't have to worry about this company
going
under that promise is dead I mean I
think this is the fourth cut meta is
doing in the last 18 months and every
time they do it their stock reacts
really positively which tells me like
investors love it and if investors love
it why would Mark Zuckerberg do anything
differently um the the other piece on
just on taking the employees side is
like right now it's a very difficult
Market to find a job and so if I'm one
of these people and I've been grinding
as like a Zuck VP for 10 years and now
all of a sudden I get a pink slip
I'm like holy what do I do next
because you know candidly I think a lot
of these responsibilities of these VPS
no longer exists within any company uh
you know and this is a couple of threads
that we've had but like you know Nvidia
Jensen has who's the CEO of Nvidia is 60
direct reports they they are
intentionally flat more companies are
cutting out these layers and and so I I
think things are changing and I think
we're starting to see like this is going
to be problematic now taking the company
side look I think meta has probably
probably has an issue with the Ivory
Tower executive the person who you know
sits around playing God all day long
isn't talking to customers isn't like
getting into the dirt and solving
problems and you know if they were
candidly to join an early stage startup
they'd be terminated probably in the
first 60 days they would never survive
inside of an early stage Tech company
and so and and and I'm wondering now is
like are there companies for these types
of of people and that type of talent
that has primarily been an executive in
the old sense of the word which is I
just manage a lot of other managers who
actually manage people who do the work
sure and let's just be careful not to
generalize right so it's not like some
special snowflakes couldn't be
successful in early stage companies or
vice versa
and we've talked about this in the show
there is a very big bias in the market
because I felt it myself when I jumped
from Yahoo into Venture um that it's
hard to do so and it actually is harder
to do so but some people can now with
that said this whole bloat thing I mean
you're you're seeing it I mean you're
seeing it an early stage you're seeing
it here again the fat and
happy um over the past 8 10 years the
people are coming down on it and I just
think it got away from us again I I I
whether it's at meta or a 300 person
Venture company I just think in good
times you're enjoying it you you
scrutinize less and I think a lot of
people got hired I think a lot of levels
and offers got bloated and I think the
Hammer's coming down in hard times like
that's the deal now could it go back the
other way maybe I mean it would take a
while but this pend swing I think we've
we've seen it a lot you know and then
and then everyone gets a wind of
everyone else oh they're doing it
they're cutting bloat we got to do it
this exact eight eight layer company
sometimes you know these Google they're
 
org shape we got to look at spans and
layers and we need to simplify this
thing y so I I think this is a common
you know give and take Nolan uh I just
wish it wasn't you know multiple Cuts
cuz that's that's what sucks on the
employee side totally agree the the
other aspect for me is
titles and I don't think we've actually
talked about this a whole lot Kelly but
you know as part of this last runup we
saw a lot of title inflation um I think
we also saw uh you know if you wanted to
get promoted you had to be on the
manager track and so you know this is an
aspect that I think as part of the
flattening of orgs like we're also going
to see a flattening of
titles and you know 300 VPS even though
meta I think has about 20,000 employees
like you know if you do the ratio it
doesn't sound crazy um given the ratio
but it it does like if you just think
about 300 VPS alone it's like do you
really need that many
VPS like it's it's a lot it's a lot I'm
telling you I walked into 300 person
company in 2016 and I was like what I
told you what's going on here everyone's
a VP like it it happens everywhere and
you know these big companies they become
very decentralized and it's hard to look
at everything from bird's ey view as
well and so you're having you know
hundreds of recruiters bringing in folks
and blah blah blah it does happen but I
think this whole blow thing is a big
deal and it's
gonna it's it's gonna yeah definitely
have a an input now on the other side I
just talked to someone you know I won't
name the company but met them last week
got laid off and they were jumping for
joy like literally like doing back flips
because the package was so incredible
and they were kind of unhappy anyway and
weren't really doing meaningful stuff so
you know I would erir that that there
probably are some people that are like
I'm going to take this again like we
said and take my nine months to spend
time with family wait for the market to
loosen up which I believe it already is
starting to do so Andor like finally
bite the bullet and make a life change
and take off and move or do something
different
yeah I I actually it's an interesting
story um because I I have another friend
going through a similar situation right
now about to take a
package and there's not really much
concern and look I I think a lot of
these people who've been tucked in for
the last few years who have weathered
the storm and haven't been out of a job
don't understand how tough it is now you
did mention I I also agree with you I
think things are opening but I don't
think we're we're not going back to this
world that was you know 2020 2021 that's
not that's not the world anymore um at
least for the next five to 10 years I do
not expect to see that at all and I
think it's going to be a lot tougher for
these people and I think you know that's
one of my takes is is like the business
reality and the candidate
expectation are not aligned right

Heretics here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less hum yet delighting a digital
Workforce is possible and it can even be
dare we say fun that's where work Vivo
zoom's employee experience platform
comes in if you've ever record spiled at
the thought of a static internet that
looks like something you built in 1995
using Ms paint have no fear work Vivo is
a dynamic intuitive accessible and
mobile First Tool people actually like
using it which is why companies like
ryion Aire Dollar General virgin and
more have rolled it out to hundreds of
thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shoutouts and live streams among
other Fe feachers help Elevate the
employee experience like never before
the result dramatically better retention
productivity and most importantly
connectedness a greater sense of the
belonging we all crave at work whether
we sit at a desk or drive a truck make
work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics s
 
and the only people who have that
alignment are the people who have been
really struggling to get a job for the
last six to 12 months and those people
know how brutal it is I think a lot of
these people who have been tucked in
don't understand quite how bad it is
even though they're hearing stories from
friends yeah look I mean we've all again
it should be a t-shirt around here it
probably is their whole rest and vest
thing um the people that are in the best
position are the ones that that one work
their ass off in these companies and had
impact and held themselves to that bar
because it is easy I will tell you it's
easy to get a little lazy like it's not
it's not difficult to just kind of hang
out once in a while but if you keep
pushing networking yeah hustling keeping
up with what's going on that that is a
different ball game and so I think I
think some folks are going to have to
start from behind the eightball here um
and those folks are better aen to also
take more operational roles in earlier
stage companies right we talked about
this like in my role the last 14 years
as a as a chap people officer head of
people you're not an executive or an IC
you're both like all the time you're
literally like hanging out in boardrooms
and talking about the the future and
then you're doing spreadsheets and
you're doing that that's like
grinding and so folks that can always
kind of balance those two treadmills I
like to call it they will always have
better or more plentiful opportunities I
totally agree I I would Point people to
an episode that Kelly and I did uh a
segment on networking um and it it
people mention it to me all the time but
I've been thinking about like advice
I've been giving to friends and so
obviously there's the networking aspect
which is always Network there's the uh
you know the ability to walk and chew
gum with being in the iory tower at the
strategy and then also getting into the
dirt and actually solving real problems
with your hands and then you know I
think a lot about just like you should
be taking recruiter calls even if you
are happy in your role like there's this
benefit that you get of like well what
what is my personal cop market like what
should I be making right now and like
the best way to know is to talk to
recruiters because they will tell you
what companies are benchmarking at least
for like the initial offer and then two
you never know when you're going to need
these people so the sub thread to
networking is like the 1A is like yes
your personal Network your peers your
friends but also recruiters like you got
to stay close with these people and I
feel like recruiting gets kind of a bad
rap when these are the people who are
actually like The Gatekeepers for
opportunities for folks yeah I I was
talking to someone about six months ago
and you know I love analogies that maybe
make sense to only me sometimes but I
was like you got to keep the cement
truck going at all times
like that thing always has to be turning
with ideas I don't care if you're
reading or learning something new or
researching keeping up with stuff
listening to podcasts talking to people
attending events networking helping
others advising like once that cement
trunk kind of like sticks and that
cement hardens it's kind of like oh man
I just got big shock and now we have to
like work harder to keep it going so you
always got to keep keep that thing going
and working and thinking and hustling
good things will happen and even if
nothing bad happens more good things
happen because the cement truck's going
yep my analogy I guess not analogy but
the way I like to think about it is
expanding your surface area of luck and
so you know this is the analogy is like
a lot of fishing lines out in the water
you're likely to have a bite totally so
we could probably think of some others
but yeah send us your favorite analogies
anyways um thank you everybody let us
