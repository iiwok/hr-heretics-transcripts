know the safe happy warm place and it's
it's not like that anymore and I think
 
it's not like that anymore and I think
the hard thing for me though with meta
 
the hard thing for me though with meta
is this is like the fourth round you
 
is this is like the fourth round you
know so it's kind of like what are we
 
know so it's kind of like what are we
doing here make up our mind do it I know
 
doing here make up our mind do it I know
it's hard to do it at once however I do
 
it's hard to do it at once however I do
empathize you know that is a tough place
 
empathize you know that is a tough place
to be in and a lot of anxiety right even
 
to be in and a lot of anxiety right even
if I know some employees are you know
 
if I know some employees are you know
entitled or they thought it was the safe
 
entitled or they thought it was the safe
place forever or they're you know
 
place forever or they're you know
high-profile high level at at these
 
high-profile high level at at these
companies but it is difficult when it's
 
companies but it is difficult when it's
kind of multiple cuts across a year that
 
kind of multiple cuts across a year that
that is a tough place to be in and so
 
that is a tough place to be in and so
for me it's it's almost like the big
 
for me it's it's almost like the big
question for me Nolan is where else do
 
question for me Nolan is where else do
you go like we talked about staying
 
you go like we talked about staying
hungry we talked about you know kind of
 
hungry we talked about you know kind of
always going out there you know your
 
always going out there you know your
stomach half full and working hard and
 
stomach half full and working hard and
networking and hustling I don't believe
 
networking and hustling I don't believe
a lot of these people have done that for
 
a lot of these people have done that for
sometimes double digit years yep that's
 
sometimes double digit years yep that's
exactly the way I've been thinking about
 
exactly the way I've been thinking about
it Kelly I think there's like a couple
 
it Kelly I think there's like a couple
threads to pull on so first let me take
 
threads to pull on so first let me take
the employee side and so you know the
 
the employee side and so you know the
the promise of big tech one of the
 
the promise of big tech one of the
promises of big Tech is safety in
 
promises of big Tech is safety in
addition to you get to work on scale
 
addition to you get to work on scale
problems and other cool things but in
 
problems and other cool things but in
general like you have job security you
 
general like you have job security you
don't have to worry about this company
 
don't have to worry about this company
going
 
going
under that promise is dead I mean I
 
under that promise is dead I mean I
think this is the fourth cut meta is
 
think this is the fourth cut meta is
doing in the last 18 months and every
 
doing in the last 18 months and every
time they do it their stock reacts
 
time they do it their stock reacts
really positively which tells me like
 
really positively which tells me like
investors love it and if investors love
 
investors love it and if investors love
it why would Mark Zuckerberg do anything
 
it why would Mark Zuckerberg do anything
differently um the the other piece on
 
differently um the the other piece on
just on taking the employees side is
 
just on taking the employees side is
like right now it's a very difficult
 
like right now it's a very difficult
Market to find a job and so if I'm one
 
Market to find a job and so if I'm one
