what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics all right
so Brian you've done quite a bit in your
career just to name a couple of
highlights you joined square at about
 
the chro at Yahoo during the Marissa
mayor turnaround years and now you've
been the head of people at NEX door for
the last six years welcome to the show
man thanks for having me I am a big fan
so excited to have you so stoked to have
you right I want to start with next door
so you're currently there it's a
fascinating company I'm a user I think
my entire neighborhood is a user um but
as it relates to some of the Dynamics
recently it's pretty interesting so
Sarah frier who was the CEO stepped
aside last year and nextdoor's founder
is now back in the seat what has that
transition been like for you uh it's
definitely been an interesting year you
know this is my uh I just just passed my
six sixth year anniversary at next door
a couple weeks ago actually and um when
I joined in 2018 with Sarah you know we
were we were coming in as really the
beginning of the second era where at the
time uh near of toia who was the founder
CEO was moving up to the board and we
were the incoming leadership team and so
you know six you know five years later
uh Sarah steps aside nerov comes back as
CEO and so we're really kind of in this
third era of the company and what's been
fascinating like when many Founders
return is you're trying to think about
the origin days of the company you know
find that find that early startup magic
and so we're trying to take the best of
that with also what we learned in those
five years of the secondary we were
really scaling the company we raised
money we took the company public uh and
so now in this year three what's been
interesting is you're trying to create a
new a new time for the company by
borrowing the best of those first two
time periods totally so you know founder
mode is all the rage right now are you
living in founder mode so it's actually
an interesting story because um what
nerov shared when he uh was thinking
about coming back at the beginning of
the year or really getting ready to come
back he um was thinking to himself like
someone must have looked at this like
someone must have studied Founders
returning and how to think about this
how to come back with a set of
principles and he discovered this book
called the founders mentality um by
James Allen who's a a bane consultant
and he just kind of sent him an a cold
email on LinkedIn he didn't know him and
he was like you know I found it next
door I'm kind of coming back would you
talk to me I'm just kind of curious
about this and so um we've really taken
some of the principles from his book and
from this practice and put it to work
and this this was maybe three or four
months before the founders mode kind of
exploded on Twitter I think it was
around you know late spring early summer
and so um it's been fascinating for us
to be kind of thinking about this
Founders mentality framework U that's
come from studying hundreds and
thousands of companies and why founder
Le companies are often more successful
and to to in parallel kind of see the
conversation around Founders bone which
I personally think started very kind of
superficial and a lot of platitudes and
kind of you know it when you see a type
of thing but now it's it's kind starting
to evolve to be to be really more
precise and prescriptive about what what
we
mean yeah I I'm a big fan of next tour
as well also a user like you Nolan um I
got to be honest though I drive like a a
lunatic and so I'm afraid that I'm going
to show up on there like hey this car
watch out like I'm serious but um it's a
great product and we talk a lot you know
about people that are in hypergrowth
mode and and how they're you know
scaling these companies like like Blitz
scaling and growing very quickly um you
know you've been at next door for six
years which is which is rare in the
sense of being in in this role at one
company for six years I mean if you look
at me I'm like three years four years
tops and I love that I don't think we
dig into that enough like how how is
that Journey Brian as far as doing this
for six years and kind of the ups and
downs or repeats or tearing like tell us
about that I love to hear about that
yeah you know it's interesting you kind
of started the story at Square makes me
feel a lot younger because before Square
I was at Google for eight years you know
and be I joined Google kind of five
years after I came to Silicon Valley in
the do boom um and the I think the
reason that's interesting is you know I
was at Google for eight but then like
you I was at Square for just about three
when it was kind of went from startup
 
a couple months after I left I was at
Yahoo for just about two years and so I
was looking for my next thing after
Yahoo isn't it was I wanted to be
intentional about I've got to make a
choice where I can really get get into
it because I think especially in the
world of people things like culture this
this stuff can take a while you know um
and so I I just wanted to be to be able
to see different iterations and how
things evolve I mentioned at the
beginning like these different eras and
what the through line is what changes um
and so yeah that that tenure is
increasingly rare but I I think it's a
real benefit if you can pull it off yeah
and I I mean especially the past 2ish
years when things were you know not like
they were in 2021 ET the skill sets are
so different um and I was like you know
the skill set to be a hyperscaler all
these things it's nice and shiny and
great it's also just as important to
have a skill set around surviving
downsizing reiterating Reinventing a
company and not a lot of cpos do that
for for six years so I just wanted to
kind of hear about yeah for sure so I
kind if you look at those four companies
Google uh Square Yahoo and next door I
spent 10 years combined at Google and
Yahoo tens of thousand employees you
know and then I spent 10 years basically
combined at square and next door which
is more of that couple hundred 500 plus
uh phase and they they're really
different organizational challenges you
know when I was thinking about joining
uh Yahoo um I had felt like my career at
that point had largely been growth and
scaling you know Google grew when I
joined it was 3,000 people when I left
it was like 880,000 people um and square
like I said Grew From 150 to 1,600 but
yeah it was a turnaround and I I'd never
really kind of take I'd never kind of
looked at those set of challenges before
and I was really curious about it and it
was similar when I joined next door it
was both a startup but it was also a
change in leadership so I thought it had
elements of both and I think that thing
that that I learned in these these last
kind of 10 years of turnaround is you
know the the headwinds are are much more
apparent if I'm kind of stating the
obvious but um what what can be tricky
when you're growing and this is kind of
why I ey roll sometimes all the Geniuses
that like say how they did it is
sometimes the Tailwind is what did it
the the product Market fit of the
company makes everyone look like a
genius and when you're doing a
turnaround like anything going right is
probably because of your you know idea
and effort you're getting no help you
know so that you feel like you're
failing all the time but when you get a
win you know that you actually planted a
flag somewhere that that really worked
you know then then I think that helps
when when you go back into growth mode
because you have more clarity around
what works and what doesn't that is such
a great point and especially you know
those who are recruiting like
lieutenants of any kind HR or not it's
like look for look for those that have
stuck it out and and and built something
when the tailwins weren't there and yeah
you know they it doesn't matter it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter and it
doesn't matter because when you win it
covers up all of those warts that was
one of my learnings from this year one
of the things that I feel like I've
known for a while and it's just so hard
to operationalize with recruiting is the
way people chase successful logos you
know and they they use a company that's
successful as a proxy for oh they must
be good 100% so much of the time and by
if you just take the thought I was
saying like you learn so much more in
these environments where you know it's
not working you know just takes sales
like sales people have to sell something
that's hard to sell they're better at
selling than selling something something
that is everybody wants to buy you know
you can apply this to almost almost any
problem and um the best principle that
really helped anchor this for me comes
from the capora center in Oakland
California they they uh you know
longtime Venture firm in the in the Bay
Area and they talk they taught me anyway
that or I learned from reading about
something they had written about the
idea this the distance traveled is
really what you should look at you
should study how far someone has had to
come to get where they are and this
recruiting of logos is like the opposite
you're you're looking at where someone
is today as kind of like their story and
um again it's just every company I see
they just they they want to borrow from
other companies success U by taking
people from there yeah yeah there's a
term for it now the halo effect the halo
effect yeah and it's it's such a false
signal because you know I I'm working
with a lot of early stage Founders right
now and one of the things that they'll
do inevitably when we're talking about
open roles and what they're optimizing
for is I want somebody from like XY hot
company totally and it's such a it it
it's it could be true right especially
if they were like there early like I
mean you were really early at Square
which I want to talk about in a second
um if they were there early and they've
seen some but if you hop on the
rocket ship and the the destination's
already determined I find that those
people actually have they missed the
most important ingredient which is
dealing with
adversity and over the last couple of
years everybody in Tech has dealt with a
 ton of adversity but some of these
companies man you know it's just so easy
there like you don't actually get what
it's like to have been forged in the
fire and candidly those are the people
that you want when things start to go
sideways I think the second thing is is
they probably don't know a lot about why
stuff worked they they think they know
but they kind of picked it up Midstream
and they weren't there for the insights
you know I was talking to a founder last
week who wanted to learn about early
Square recruiting and he had heard that
we had done like these events he was
like well tell me about these events
they were so special like what was the
trick and I was like it wasn't the event
it was the fact that our CTO is the you
know the late Bob Lee you know so s see
him go he was the most prolific
recruiter of Engineers I've ever seen so
we would do the party we like hey can
someone bring one or two Engineers as a
referral he I'm not kidding he would
show up with 50 people all them like
great engineers and so it wasn't that we
just had this event but somehow people
are hearing that you need to throw an
event event for us totally doesn't
matter without without that ingredient y
that makes total sense all right so it
reminds me of really quick it reminds me
of that episode remember we had Peterson
Conway maybe it was about over a year
ago but he was like we we search for
people that are that are chess players
based out of country I mean looking for
these backgrounds of what makes up the
individual to your point like what
they've been through what they've done
is is is that trick and that's a hard
thing maybe you know one that AI can't
quite grasp yet but yeah I like asking
people in interiew sorry I was going to
say on that on that point like I like
asking people in interviews like tell me
about your hardest day you hard hardest
day is everybody's hardest day right but
when they kind of walk you through like
what happened you can put them on a
spectrum of like do you think that was
actually hard yeah is it something
that's like not that big of a deal or
were you like whoa I I couldn't handled
that no way you know yeah on that point
actually one of my favorite questions
what's the hardest thing you've done in
your life uh I got I actually got a
terrible answer on that like on Friday
and I was like this person hasn't seen
anything yeah that's tough she said her
wedding I was like that can't be like
what like you want to take a minute
think about this um all right let's talk
I mean you never you never know you
never know the I clicked in it was not
real okay all right so let's let's go
back to square so when you were at
Square it was such an interesting time
so 150 people Jack is still at the HM
Keith R boy is the COO who's a very
Ecentric personality you told me a story
about how you guys ran manager training
dur our prep during our prep call can
you tell that story now yeah sure um
manager training is really hard
especially when you're in that scaling
phase because uh when growing it's like
everybody's stretched you know the
classic thing of you hire the person and
then six months later the pace of growth
has outgrown their capability so you
want to like improve your chances that
the leaders you're bringing in are going
to be able to do more and so training is
kind of the obvious way to do this but
I've found in these smaller stages like
no one has time you know no one no one
shows up it doesn't matter how good the
domain expert is they're like I just
don't have two days so that everyone
tries to say hey I know your course is
two days can you get it down to like 90
minutes which is like ridiculous you
know but it's very common the time
allocation and so what was unique about
Square was in our original or our office
on Fifth admission when he walked in the
door there was a bookshelf and it was
just kind of books that Jack thought
everyone should have and we would give
out books as part of uh their
orientation but what we started doing is
when a new leader would join is we would
give them like the top row and we' have
them pick a few books that had helped
them think about their own leadership
style and so I was like okay people like
the books I was really struggling with
like what are we going to do you we got
to do something so what we said was
we're going to take our four most senior
Executives so Keith R boy Sarah frier
just joined CFO uh Jesse dor guser ran
the hardware team that basically built
all the square products and then Jack
and we paired each leader with like a TA
and so we picked like a a Next Level
leader down and so I was Heat's ta and
what we said was you're just GNA pick a
book and you're going to show up and
you're just talk about this book and
explain all the different things in the
book that helped you that that a manag
think about and this is how we're going
to do it in like 990 minutes and
everyone will go because all the leaders
are there you know they they will make
time if the most senior people there
that's you know the senior leaders kind
of role modeling I'm teaching you so you
better go teach people and the book is
like I we decid the book's good enough
we don't need our own branded kind of
leadership training it we're still early
it was still early in like our cultural
DNA so just having them talk would give
us we could figure out what was useful a
useful there the book that um Keith
chose was highit management by Andy
Grove which interes you know classic
text now it's getting old it's written
in 1982 but funny the the last chapter
is called training is the boss's
job hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently high quality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happen happened in the
interview and I've seen VPS and CEOs
block hires because they didn't learn
anything from skeleton scorecards
metaview changes everything with perfect
notes from every conversation your
people can focus on creating a human
connection with candidates and they can
save time on the busy work of cleaning
up notes after every interview but it's
so much more than just a timesaver
because perfect notes means perfect data
for every candidate and every pipeline
hiring teams can make confident and
formed decisions and talent leaders can
finally take control of the interview
process metaview covers all your
compliance needs works with all your
existing tools and takes less than 3
minutes to set up join Talent leaders at
organizations like brex deal hellofresh
and quora and check out metaview head
over to metav view. a/h Heretics to talk
to one of metav View's product experts
tell them that me and Kelly sent you or
you could just go to their website and
get started for free you'll be up
running and AI enabled in
minutes I think that uh you have to
struggle with the leaders are so busy
but the the the best one of the best
ways to get stuff out of people is to
increase their capability level and the
best person to do that is their manager
or the leaders and so I I always like it
was pretty successful you know we got
all the leaders in a room together and
talking so we started to get some
consistency um and I've always just
taken that principle like I always want
to try to find a way to have leaders
teaching built into the culture of the
company it's the
it's the best way to get people to show
up and and
try I have such a oh my God I have such
a strong point of view on this and it's
exactly that like everyone's always like
well how do you train leaders what's the
best leadership development program what
is this you know polish shiny thing that
that we can do and I'm like you know
what it's kind of like culture like this
is kind of like culture everyone's like
well culture is is values or this event
I'm like no it's not it's the hundreds
of thousands if not millions of data
points that everyone in this company
experiences every day in and out that
make up an experience in a culture
that's what it is what's training it
it's the the real real experiences data
points
conversations um serendipitous learning
that that these these folks are getting
and so I I just can't handle the
classroom stuff I'm like whatever you
need to do to make it a part of the flow
of the day the business that's how it is
and leaders teaching leaders I think is
an incredible component of that yeah I
think the role modeling is really
important you know you no matter how
good the domain expert you bring in from
the outside and I don't want to like
diss the the industry you know there's
lots of incredible coaches and and
teachers there but when you're early
when you're really setting the stage for
what your culture is going to become in
the leadership ranks kind of the leaders
investing time in this makes a statement
totally and I and I don't want to diss
them either it's just I do believe that
they're necessary and not sufficient
yeah I also think cuz I think about the
bigger companies I worked at um you know
I learned incredible trainings at Google
when it was really big but when you're
bigger and you're more mature really
more defined these things become like a
tool in a tool kit you know startup is
so chaotic and crazy like you really
want to start to imprint the foundation
of what the culture is going to be first
before you start importing stuff and I
think sure I've definitely learned
lessons along the way of if you haven't
defined this well
and you're growing really quickly what
happens is you you send a you know
everyone hires through networking so you
get these tribes of people coming from
another company you know what I mean uh
you can see this at every company that's
scaled all the Google people that went
to Facebook all the Google people that
went to Twitter you all the yes the
people now that are moving on from
stripe and go to these other PL like
there's these Pathways where networks
follow each other and they will bring
the old culture to work their new job
and if the the startup or the smaller
company hasn't really defined how you do
it here it's like an invasive species
and you get this group from the outside
starts using their operating system and
it's like a second language it's really
like actually not understanding the
language and people are speaking around
you in another tongue you know and so
I've I've really come to learn it's so
important for companies in the early
stage to Define what their culture is so
that you kind of get the new people to
assimilate versus kind of bring their
own their own group Tendencies yeah yeah
there's a lot of things you can
Outsource in the early days there's a
lot of admin to deal with that
you can just like give
away culture and training managers is
not one of those things I I think the
failure mode actually is bringing in one
of those outside experts I did it uh I
did it at Carter that was actually like
one of the mistakes that I made because
I was like oh my God everyone's super
busy you know let's bring in like the
reputable firm who does manager training
to like come help us and look they gave
like some really good foundational like
here's how to to manage SS of things
like they have best practices right but
the problem is is if it's not applicable
specifically to that company in that
moment in time it invasive species is
the Perfect Analogy because it's like
well why are we doing this now like
that's not us yeah and it's like well
what is us and the only thing that can
Define us is the leadership and
especially in a Founder Le company
usually just the founder I definitely
agree with that and I think the other
thing you run the risk of is it can also
limit Innovation if you hire people
you're kind of following in the path of
um like it's Square we talked a little
bit about this you know Square was
really trying to disrupt the payments
landscape you know really trying to
change the way things worked and even
though Keith had come from papayal we
really had it it was like an executive
decision from Jack in particular Keith
was on board too is we were not hiring
anyone from the payments industry and
what often happens in an industry that's
getting disrupted is the people in the
industry see the disruption sooner and
so they want to go to the new startup
and we were really so we had all these
applicants from people from other
payments you know from the space wanted
to join Square it fair unfair it was
like a hard no and and the reason for
that was we didn't want someone to come
in with a lot of domain expertise
explaining why things wouldn't work you
know and when you're being Innovative
you're this is what founders iconically
do is they just question why something
is a certain way on a very big way and
they don't let someone explain you're
not going to be able to do that like
they don't get I mean people try you
know that's what is so impressive about
people that start companies they all
talk about the number of you know
rejections and resistance you know
people that wouldn't write them a check
they had to go through uh but they're
just Relentless and ultimately that what
leads to the big the big changes yeah
that is a crazy learning for me so you
guys were building a payments company
which by the way like payments has so
much nuance and like specialty areas
that you have to understand like how the
thing works you literally had like the
COO who was early who was PayPal Mafia
and he was the person who was like no we
don't want to like bring more of these
people over well Keith's widely
proclaimed himself as a contrarian you
know what I mean and so I think he in
his own way is biased towards not doing
it the way lots of people have done it
before so I think it was a good uh
person to have there but he he didn't
want to copy uh what PayPal had done or
what anyone else had done he he was kind
of biased towards doing something
disruptive and new but I do think it's
like this this comes back to what you're
saying is like so many Founders are like
oh we need experience we need to hire
from this company that we're disrupting
and when you bring those people in they
have tried what you tried maybe and they
just convince you not to do it that's
that's really kind of the Insight if
you're going to be disruptive the the
real winners come from going their own
way yeah you know I just want to accent
how hard that is though because we can
sit here and say you know don't do this
and when you're in that freaking hot
seat and trying to get something going
you're under pressure you're trying to
get you know customers and you're try
that is a really hard thing to like be
disciplined about not doing I it's why
it's why so many people fail you know
there there so it's why so many startups
fail for this this reason they don't
know how to do something and they don't
figure it out right but I think as you
start to find success and product fit
again people start to chase you you know
the resume the volume no one's sending
you their resume when you haven't
figured it out but as soon as people
start to click in they get more funding
they start to become more visible sure
the the risk profile changes and people
want to go you know back to a smaller
stage than they than they are currently
yeah I mean Nolan you're a Founder I
just I can't imagine how hard that is
not to take a bite to that Apple when
it's sitting in front of you yeah I mean
Brian you said something really
interesting about the the senior Talent
convincing you not to do things because
they've seen how it's been done before
so I think On a related note just
broadly in Tech hiring starting to come
back and as I'm talking to Founders
literally every conversation has some
sort of this version of I want somebody
senior for this
role and my concern I like my broader
concern actually is I'm worried that
tech companies are under indexing on
early career Talent and we're going to
have this like really large swath of
high potential people that we should
want in Tech that should be working at
like the best tech companies in the
world that we're going to miss on um but
you actually brought up a different
reason which I hadn't considered which
is well senior people actually have seen
things which in some areas can be good
but in especially Innovation areas can
be really bad because they're not going
to reason from first principles they're
going to reason from analogy and pattern
matching what they've already see yeah
that's a really interesting take yeah so
I think um so pattern matching is a word
you hear a lot as desirable you know um
we want someone who can pattern match
and what that means is we want someone
who's seen the problem before so they
can help us get to success faster right
and it gets what I what I fear is a real
risk is uh gets back to what we were
saying earlier which is if they're just
literally matching patterns like I saw
this at my last company I see it at this
company I know what to do if they don't
understand the problem on a deeper level
than just recognition the pattern
matching might work at first and
oftentimes does so right away they get
quick wins they get more credibility
they get more resources because they're
like I know what to do but at some point
the pattern doesn't match anymore and
then what do they do and so you know to
use your words like the people who can
break the problem down into principles
you know who can really who have Mastery
of these problems because they've seen
them in lots of different ways and they
know why the pattern doesn't match
anymore that's really hard to find right
but I think the Trap is so there's not
knowing what to do at all there's having
seen this before and then there's
knowing what to do at least not knowing
what to do you're you're trying stuff
and you kind of see its failure that the
the success that's like shortlived can
be so dangerous uh for companies it's
almost like you started going down this
hallway and then you're at a dead end so
now you have to go backwards you know
and I see this a lot in technical
organizations where you want Engineers
who have done this before they did it
this other company they come in they
start doing what they did before it
works and then it just doesn't work
anymore and to your point like there
it's probably not the person that built
the system at the other company it's
someone who joined a bigger team and so
they don't know why certain things were
a certain way those are kind of the key
Concepts to be able to differentiate
your new problem from the old
one so if I'm in the audience I'm like
that's wonderful gentlemen like how do I
interview for that what do I what do I
ask how do I think about that in the
hiring process because I think we all
would agree that a lot of it is hey
Brian's done this at three other
companies this is great get him in here
we need this what are folks missing in
that Pro hiring process they should dig
into and how would you do that in
addition to that well hiring is hard
first of all you know hiring is never
never easy you all know that I think I I
try to be as aware of the traps as I am
about the Magic Bullet because I don't
think there's any magic way around it
and getting back to like the way people
chase logos is I get anxious when you
start to hear everybody using like the
right language you know they they start
walking in and using things like Talent
density and principle versus Playbook
they're just speaking Silicon Valley
Twitter and what happens is people think
oh these people totally know what
they're talking about right but they
really just have this vocabulary of the
moment you know and I I worry how often
that signal early on because you all you
guys know this the first couple minutes
you've kind of already decided and so
that familiarity is a mask for their
capability level or their intell or
problem solving capability you know and
so that's that's one risk I think all
the time so asking people you know oh
tell me about your last company which I
idolize and love and they telling you
about this company you admire now you're
like oh wow this sounds amazing we
should totally hire them you're not
really getting into what did they solve
or not solve and then I'm always a big
believer can people explain complicated
things in simple terms you know that's
the the complex language you're like oh
wow I don't know what that means this
person sounds really smart is often a
trap if they can explain this complex
stuff I don't understand really simple
way I feel like they understand it much
better you use any domain any function
you know that's that's a good way to do
it I could not agree more and now that
we're here and you said it I mean let's
kick Around Talent density a little bit
because it it's out there it's a very
smart word it's out there a lot you know
it's from I believe it's from the know
rules rules book by the CEO of Netflix
um here at next door I was lucky enough
to work with uh Leslie Kilgore who was
on our board for many years she was the
CMO of Netflix she's prominently
featuring the books I got to ask as all
all sorts of questions about this yeah I
see Talent density all over my LinkedIn
fee now Everybody's Got Talent density
um I've kind of decided it's the 2024
word for we have a worldclass team um
and again I think it's an important
concept basically it means you know
everyone who works here is talented and
awesome you know and we won't let anyone
who's not talented um I think it's it's
pretty rare for a company to be able to
achieve that you know I felt like again
 
at Google I Google really had that when
it was hundreds of people but I think
one thing Google had going for it again
this is now 2002 so a million years ago
but no one was hiring when Google was
imprinting its leadership when it was
going from hundreds of thousands of
people the dotc era had just exploded
and so there were no there was literally
no competition and so Google was a great
company with no one to compete against
you know similarly Facebook was going
from hundreds to thousands again really
important leadership imprinting moment
that was happening in 20089 during the
financial crisis also like the breaks
stopped where Facebook was scaling so
there's like these macro Advantage both
of them to out compete when there's no
competition that I think in a in a like
in the AI space today there's so much
freaking competition you know like I
think it's hard for anyone to say again
once you get past like 30 people I love
all the Geniuses of 30 people in
companies that explain to the world how
it works with a 30 person company you
know but really maintaining that density
to hundreds and thousands is very very
very hard yeah and all serious know I
think I think you raise a great point
that I I could not agree more with is
being able to explain something and
break it down with Simplicity in a way
that you know someone on the street can
understand just you know um requires you
to understand it that much more and I
just I coach you know I coach HR leaders
and Business Leaders right now Brian and
it's incredible how intimidated senior
folks can get by these words and these
big phrases and it impacts them in in
their role Etc and so I think it's
important just to make sure that
everyone knows this is what it is don't
don't get intimidated by the fancy words
trust your gut know what you're doing
research Benchmark Etc but have your
have your own point of view um and I
think that's more pervasive than we
actually probably talk about well you
need to be able to explain it to like a
fifth grader totally that's that's
actually the I think you know you talked
about Mastery earlier Brian yeah and I
think Robert Green said this is like the
you know the author on the space yeah um
you know he his take is is like if you
can't explain it to like a fifth grader
or a third grader then you're not a
master at the thing uh and and to your
point on language I learned this a few
years ago when we were just starting to
build Continuum and I was like learning
about all these Marketplace Dynamics and
I said at Christmas this intermediation
uh which is like the biggest douchebag
word of all time and my family was like
the what um and and it was like a
really it was a really important moment
for me I was like oh my God like I I
actually can't explain what that is and
I didn't know it well enough at the time
yeah and it was an exposure moment for
me of like I actually have a lot more
homework to do and not only just
homework but like actually being in the
field using the thing because you nailed
it on on VC Twitter it's super easy to
just take all the words that they're
using and then build that into your
vocabul and use that in your vocabulary
but the true Masters at it can break it
down to anybody regardless of what field
they are in or what age they are I agree
and the language is like contagious you
know people hear a new expression it
sounds really cool VC Twitter loves to
do kind of the weirdly paradoxical
metaphor yes you know and they just take
off and people again throw it around to
sound Cutting Edge totally not cutting
edge it's just new new words right so um
right yeah it's a tradition in the
valley this the second piece of talent
density we haven't talked about and I
feel like kind of gets under discussed
is the talent that's currently in the
building and upleveling that Talent so
it feels like the moment we're currently
in right now is well we uh every year
we're going to manage out the bottom 10%
of the organization Elon famously does
this at Tesla essentially every year
Tesla runs a riff uh and as you know
friend of the show called mccre talks
about she's like that's just like they
do a crash Diet before they're you know
going on a a a beach holiday um which I
totally agree with what's your take on
these like because it's actually coming
up more and more now um I feel like now
Elon has gotten so powerful especially
in the founder community that what he
does is essentially viewed his gospel to
all of these Founders out there and
they're like well we should just manage
out the bottom 10% every year how do you
feel about that practice in and of
itself and then second order what's your
take on how to uplevel people that are
already in the
organization yeah okay so the first one
especially in a people leader role like
you have to understand what you're doing
to maintain performance that's that's
kind of what it is you know what are how
are you how are you having managers and
leaders of the company push their teams
and push forward you know and I think
the CEO has to be the ultimate person
who's pushing everyone you know Elon of
does this out in public a lot but really
if the C the CEO is probably the fastest
gear in in a successful place they're
like the last line of defense for
maintaining urgency and intensity uh
with what they're doing and so how how
that works for you culturally really
depends on the type of company you are
you know it's the like the whole
conversation around performance reviews
is not new it's Decades of getting rid
of performance reviews or bringing them
back or doing them once a year or doing
them every week this is is not an this
has been going on forever you know of
like what what should you do and so at
some point you know the companies that
take this light touch now and no longer
requirement and say we'll just do
check-ins over time you're going it's
most likely you're going to lose
intensity and regar because managers are
busy and conflict is hard right and so
when you feel like you pull back too
much you end up implementing things like
no you have to write it down I want you
to be able to show me what that was
communicated to them that leads either
to emails or written reviews or whatever
then that becomes overburdensome too
administrative and you cut it back again
but it's very kind of company dependent
on what what you need to do right now um
but there's not like I just don't think
there's a best thing there's a best
thing for your company in the in the
moment right and so how how you drive
that forward particularly as you get
bigger that's what's so hard and in a
company of under 100 people you can run
around and yell at everybody who's not
working and the pace will pick up you
know thousands of people you're really
dependent on layers of leadership to do
that and it gets diluted the further
away you get from the the leadership
team so what's your approach you're
going too slow because it's too
administrative or you're not doing
enough because it's too casual and I
think people leaders need to kind of
lean in uh lean in and out on that and
then on the second point about kind of
the upleveling um again you know it's
from high output management and he's
really simply explains like there's only
two ways to get someone to do more it's
either their motivation or they don't
know how to do it in my test which I
take from this book is could you do it
if your life dependent on it you know
like if if I was going to be shot if I
didn't play the violin that's a wrap you
know like U that's it if I needed to run
a six and a half minute mile I couldn't
go do that right now but if my life
depended on it I might break that time
and so the manager can decide what is my
Approach here do they know how to do it
and they just don't want to or do they
not know how to do it and I think that
that is true at all levels of the work
the jobs get bigger for people the
pressure goes up is it that they just
don't know what to do or it's becoming
too much for them to want want to do it
you know and I think this stuff changes
again I think when especially when
you're scaling it's so funny I've seen
it so many times this person comes in
and they are the new hotness the company
is like we are saved and then six months
a year later again this is really in
hypergrowth they're way over their head
and they they're totally they were ahead
of the curve six months ago and six
months later it's like they're getting
layered you know or or they've gota they
got to move on and that's just the chaos
and volatility of of uh you know
changing circumstances where that's the
business goes down and the business is
going up really fast yep hey moving uh
from the chaos of the early stage
companies to the Googles and yahoos of
the world um our audience has broadened
a ton over the last year Briant so we
have a lot of different Industries and
sizes and your background I love and
it's kind of rare that we've had on the
show which is you know the Googles and
the yahoos and then the chaos and
whatnot and I was at Yahoo earlier than
you I don't know if we overlocked or not
but I think the learnings around what
happens at these big companies like not
really their demise that might be you
know too strong of a word but you know
what what do you what do you what did
you see in those later years because I
left right before Marissa came on and I
think you kind of took the company
through that that next Evolution and I'd
love just to get a view of how was that
at these larger companies what happens
like so I'm just I'm remembering a
metaphor from earlier um it's so funny
the the founder of Gupta systems uman
Gupta was like an early Oracle employee
I was told by a Founder that he said
this and then go rajman introduced me to
umang gup and he's like never never said
that don't know what you're talking
about but it doesn't mean but the
metaphor is really really good it's did
he say Talent density did he say Talent
what he said was he says when he talked
to a manager or a leader retiring he
says are you a dirt road manager a
gravel road manager or a paved Road
manager and if you use that as a mental
metaphor for the world you're in you
know a dirt road is like a 20 person
startup there's no signs no Road you are
basically in the jungle and some people
freaking love that
I can't do this this people that like do
this are nuts to me but they like
working on every single topic every day
you know they they don't want to leane
they want to literally do everything and
the diversity of challenges is really
interesting to them and then a gravel
road is kind of in the middle it's got
like elements of a startup but some
things are really clicking in you all
know that experience of like you're on a
gravel road is better than riding in a
dirt path but it's still kind of yeah
Rocky and I think this is a lot of where
people really want to be in Tech and
then the pave road is like the big
company you know it's like you can go
really fast but you can't really change
direction ctions very easily or whenever
you want you have to kind of take the
offerings and what I took from that at
bigger companies the reason why a lot of
I think startup or smaller company
people get frustrated and fail is they
want to constantly be creating and
changing and doing things and at bigger
companies you it's about like really
aligning and taking a long time to align
a lot of people and staying the course
with what you're going to do and if you
can achieve that you can really operate
in a big big way but what you can't do
is change your mind every two or three
months about what to do that the whole
thing just becomes comes paralyzed right
and so what I I really saw that at at
Google and at Yahoo is was you know you
kind of set the simple course that
everyone can understand but then it
takes a long time to get that many
people around the like at Google and yah
there's you know dozens of countries
tens of thousands of people again you
can't just like again startup people
kind of want the All Hands Where
everyone's in the room and you clap your
hands like everybody understand
everybody ready to go and like with 50
people or 100 people you're you're good
everybody knows you can see everyone
nding their head but at some point
around hundreds or thousands of people
you can't just say that to all hands and
everyone gets it you know there's too
much Nuance too much context and so you
need the groups of people to really
align around what are the key what are
the key ideas and that's just such a
different skill set that than happens in
these much more Rocky kind of creative
chaos of of startups yeah yeah I mean
you wonder back to the you know why I
asked like is this defensible right
because everyone loves to complain about
the big company oh they're terrible
they're that it's like what do you
expect
yeah there are hundreds of thousands of
PE like is this
really defensible at some point uh
because I I always said that the you
know the secret to success in all these
companies is like as you get bigger it
becomes a big game of telephone and the
companies that do the best like they are
the best at playing the game of
telephone where the first person and the
last person say the same thing and
however you can figure out how to do
that as best you
can is is the winner and I just at some
point the law of numbers it just makes
it really hard and so I I guess I don't
like when a lot of people come down on
these big companies because it's just
what happens I I found too A lot of
people because so many people leave the
pig company go to a startup you know and
that's like the Silicon Valley Journey
yep a lot of times it's because what we
talked about before that their
capability level did not meet the set of
challenges that come with working at a
much bigger scale so it's their stories
I want to go back to smaller what I am
more effective but that's not
necessarily a judgment on the big
company is bad or or failing is
different and requires a different skill
set and attention about what you're
going to do totally thanks yeah that's a
really good take I want to take one
minute to talk about you said the word
alignment um you've worked with some
eccentric leaders you've worked with
some I would say like stable leaders uh
you know now you're back into a company
to where the founder is back in the seat
how do you take the time to align with
these people how do you make sure that
you're speaking the same language
because you know I always view the the
CPO job as you know the Founders the
Founder's job is culture but then your
job is to kind of operationalize that
culture and in order to do that really
well you need to be hyper aligned with
these people so what is your secret to
doing that yeah so I think one thing
I've learned that I think more people
leaders in particular should figure out
is not every great people leader is
great for a CEO like you've got to
really understand the stylistic match
you know the values alignment or
contrast that's going to make you a
effective I think so much it's like you
said they're looking for people with
certain domain expertise I want someone
senior I want someone with a background
in recruiting you know that has like
nothing to do with what's going to make
the partnership successful between the
CEO and the CPO and so the more
self-aware the CPO is on what they bring
to the party again like try to be
specific some CEOs are uh really into
conflict like they're really assertive
you know they they they're very decisive
they are quick to pull the trigger they
are quick to move and this can wreak all
sorts of havoc in the organization
particularly in a startup as you as you
get bigger and so a CPO that can partner
that with like adding patience you know
and and kind of being thoughtful some of
the time like sometimes the move is to
not make a move and those types of CEOs
never think of that they want to make a
decision and so that style matches
really well if you have a really
directive Chief people officer and a
really directive CEO it can be kind of
like too much energy on on the same side
if you have a conflict avoidance CEO
which is very common in Tech it's good
to have that assertive CPO to make sure
that the tough conversations are on the
table are happening but if you have two
conflict avoiding people in these two
roles the place is going to go nuts
because people the the issues won't
really be coming to the Head fast enough
and that's just so important uh for for
the executive team to figure out so I
really think it's like understanding
like what what strengths are you going
to bring that will augment the leader
and and sometimes it's the contrast it's
not more more of what they're good at um
and I just when I talk to people they
they don't spend enough time on this you
know they they ask you your expertise
you know the the scale you worked at the
type of problems you solved and not how
you're going to do these things together
you know that's such a great point and
you have to spend time with people to to
learn that time there's no substitute
for time on this topic there's
absolutely no substitute and my add on
that because I made this mistake early
in my career is to make sure that that
founder wants the contrast exactly uh
and and is looking for that versus it
backfiring potentially when you're
giving it yeah I would not let a Founder
say to a chief people or CEO to a chief
people officer like you'll you help me
Define what the role is they they on in
this world in particular they have to
have a point of view on the problems
yeah that you're going to partner with
them on um you you don't need to do that
with engineering or or sales like you
bring a person in they can really set
the direction on on their function it's
it's just the the founder CEO is too
close to the the culture and the people
for you to be to pretend like it's going
to be delegated to you yeah it touches
they touch everything 100% yeah and and
ultimately they're the decider on
everything yeah and the g people officer
is typically the person who is the
implementer and so this and this tends
to be a topic they don't let go of you
know like I think especially in Tech the
founders tend to stay with product and
with culture it's it's sometimes more
but I feel like it's always those two
yeah you know that they that they hold
on to that's definitely um you know I'm
really enjoying the experience with neov
that's kind of what his big focus is but
it's just so common that that's what
founder CEOs want to keep close and
again some might be suited to stay close
to sales as well or or engineering
depend on their background but that's
kind of added it to those first two I
think those are the primary ones y Brian
this conversation was excellent thank
you so much for spend time with us yeah
loved it thank you thanks for having me
like I said big fan keep doing it it's
awesome we all love it all right thanks
