For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, Coinbase Chief People Officer
LJ Brock reveals how the company's
mission first philosophy, refusal to
negotiate salaries, and rigorous talent
density standards challenge conventional
HR orthodoxy. Hey everybody, welcome
back to the HR Heretics podcast.
&gt;&gt; We have a huge show on deck for you
today. We got LJ Brock, the chief people
officer at Coinbase on HR Heretics. LJ
Brock, welcome to the show.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. Excited to be
here.
&gt;&gt; All right, I want to get right into it.
And I want to talk about September of
 
and banned political discussions at
work. this became like a huge thing in
the media. Talk to us about how that
decision came to be and how that's
played out for you guys.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I joined Coinbase in February
of 2019. It was about 700 people when I
joined that. I think Brian Armstrong,
our CEO, got a lot of advice from a lot
of great, very well-intentioned
executives. this is how you build a tech
company advice. And I think the result
of that was that for several years, you
know, the company drifted like a few
degrees off of like the compass that
Brian had. So when you fast forward all
the way to you know the the terrible
incident with George Floyd and
everything that was going on around
social justice movement what I think we
saw was that then there was an
expectation for a lot of companies in
the marketplace at least a tacid
expectation that companies were going to
focus on things outside of their mission
and I think that's where the moment hit
for Brian where he was just clear as can
be that look the only thing that
everybody at Coinbase can be assured of
that we share as a common framework is
our pursuit of the company's mission and
we don't have time or the luxury of sort
of focusing on things outside of that if
we're going to take on this truly
massive task that we're trying to
tackle. I want to talk about post the
decision and what has happened because
from my view outside of Coinbase at that
moment in time the narrative was in the
media
they're never going to hire anybody
again. Who would ever want to work at
Coinbase? They don't believe in diverse
views and having tough conversations.
So walk us through what actually
happened after Brian had the post.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, so just even even as we're
getting ready to post it, you
&gt;&gt; I had friends that were like, "You'll
never work again.
&gt;&gt; You need to resign.
You're you you know, you're blacklisted
like
&gt;&gt; this is it LJ." I mean, good trusted
friends, friends who are CHRO's, friends
who are in CHRO search. I mean, they
were doing it from a watch out for
yourself kind of thing, right? But one
of the things that I was adamant about
was yeah, hey, if we're going to do
this, we're clearly resetting the
expectations of employment at Coinbase.
And so I was really adamant that we had
to offer an opt out to the to everybody
in the organization and and say, "Look,
we're changing the expectation of maybe
why you joined. We hope everybody's
going to want to be here, but we're
going to come back next week and this is
going to be the way we operate. And if
you can't do that, then we apologize and
we're going to give you a generous
severance. And so what did ultimately
play out is a couple of things that we
saw. We found that there was a
tremendous amount of people who actually
flocked to an environment where they
were going to be free from the burden of
like division in the workplace. All the
doomsday that we thought was coming
didn't happen. We actually flourished
after that. And then I would say, you
know, the epilogue for me personally is
I could create a side business on
consulting with CEOs and CHRO's who call
me still today and say, "Hey, we would
like to do something like this, but
we're petrified. How did you do it?
&gt;&gt; How do you get through that? Because
that's not easy." Like h what gave you
comfort in continuing to do that and
have that courage because that is not
easy or common.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good question, Kelly. You
know, you want to get to your neardeath
moment with them as fast as possible.
Don't be afraid of that. Like, run head
first into your near-death moment where
you two are going to go headtohead and
you're going to figure out, are we going
to work together or are we not? And when
you get through the other side, the
trust and the connection that you have
helps you see through like, o, this fear
that people are painting at you. So, I
would say I was fortunate that Brian and
I had already had our near-death moment
together as CHRO and CEO. And and so, by
the time we got to that kind of tense
moment, I just had faith in our
relationship. I had faith that he had my
back. I had I wanted to have his back.
&gt;&gt; And so, I actually want to to get into
like you guys don't negotiate. You guys
went remote first faster than anybody.
You guys just dropped talent density.
We'll get into those things.
I want to I actually want to get into
like how do these things come about? How
do you guys roll this stuff out
internally? How does it come to be?
&gt;&gt; Most of them really started with Brian's
is the spark behind the idea. The one
that probably I really sparked more was
around the the comp model and the single
pay target. Brian generally generates
the idea. Then he says to Emily and me,
let's blow this out a little more. We
have this really simple thing called
problem proposed solution. And it
literally is, you write problem and it's
like one or two sentences and then
proposed solution. You would be shocked
at some of the major things we have
launched that came from a half page
problem proposed solution that Brian
penned shared with me and we began to
edit in the Google doc together with a
whole bunch of comments and just went
back and forth and iterated on. You
always have to push your HR team when
you're working with a founder. I always
say this like you know this is Brian's
life's work, right? Like you
And so he's just not going to accept
like well this is the way we do things
like you have to go all the way down to
the why are we doing it.
&gt;&gt; I want to talk about talent density
because in my mind I think we're going
to look back on the talent density
article very similar to the mission
focused article in 5 to 10 years and say
this was a seinal piece in tech. So for
the audience I'll give like the the
highle view. This came out in November
of 2023 and there's a few principles.
Number one is that you guys are now
doing cognitive testing, which is, you
know, more structured assessments.
You're increasing the percentage of
hires from internships.
Brian or Emily, your CEO, um, and COO
have to approve all hires.
You're giving now real time feedback for
performance management and executives
are being held accountable for talent
density in their orcs. So just walk us
through this is a lot. I mean this I
can't even imagine like how long it took
to like roll this thing out and get
alignment on this thing. Walk us through
the soup to nuts on how talent density
came to be. Brian and Emily have always
had this the the strongest desire to
have just a truly elite talent
organization have a really high bar
in the throws of sort of the as the
market you know FTX blows up finance has
challenges just general crypto I think
one of the things Brian was like I
believe crypto is going to continue to
shape the world and I believe we are the
blue chip player in crypto and I believe
we offer the very best career
opportunities to people who want to be
here. We should have the highest
standards possible and we should be
using this time to consolidate the
quality of talent in the organization.
Just one of the things we took away from
that moment is even with the best of
intentions, were we as did we hold
ourselves to the highest standards
possible on the talent bar? And our
answer was probably no. That's not to
say that we didn't. Everybody who
joined, everybody who's been here, we
thought was amazing, has great talent.
But were we holding the standards as
high as we wanted to in the moments of
runup? No. I think we would honestly say
we probably started removing too much
friction from our processes in the name
of scale. And we wanted to take a stance
right here and right now and say we'll
never do that again. We're going to
prioritize the quality of our talent
over anything at this point.
&gt;&gt; That's so good. I want to get into so
the CEO approving all offer, CEO or COO
approving all offers. Naysayers will
say, "Well, how does this scale?" So,
how are how are you guys doing real time
feedback?
&gt;&gt; If you're worried that Emily Choy is
going to slow down your hiring process,
you haven't been on Slack with her. You
can measure her response in like the
nancond. Like, I mean, it happens,
right?
&gt;&gt; That's not going to be a problem.
&gt;&gt; That's not really really fast on that
point, LJ. Because you're you're now
bringing back stories for me. One of the
things that we did is we actually put
the hiring manager and the recruiter on
the thread for offer approval. And
because we did that, they were able like
they got to see exactly how Tony was
responding and the questions that he had
and they were in charge of responding to
those questions. Do you guys do the same
thing? We have the entire exact team,
all the recruiters in there, not all the
hiring managers, but then the exact team
that is sponsoring the hire underneath
their org gets to answer or get the
questions or the recruiter. And I mean,
look, I can tell you, I mean,
&gt;&gt; so good.
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you this. So, we just went
live uh last week uh and and I know my
head of recruiting, you know, he's like
people are scared shitless like they are
rethinking every packet, every
candidate. He's like, you know, he's
like, "Right now, the pipeline's ground
to the halt, but I can see how it's
going to pay out because people are
like, literally, our bar has gone up
overnight." I mean, you know, like, yep,
I I I will say we had a scenario where
the very first candidate that we
submitted in this was rejected. I think
that candidate would have been hired the
week before the process went live.
That's us tangibly raising the hiring
bar. So, so to to your question on
feedback, look, first let me say it's
aspirational. So I don't we are not like
oh we've got this one um baked. I think
there's a couple of things at play here.
Um at the first level is one thing we're
doing is we're going to move to
beginning this year a quarterly check-in
on both you know basic same old same old
the what and the how in our numeric
system and we're going to give everybody
a rating on a quarterly basis. We are
minimally hoping that every employee
gets one reasonable conversation from
their manager once a quarter on the what
and the how in their performance and
some tangible examples of that. That to
me is like table stakes. The fact that
that's like our minimum thing is almost,
you know, not a great moment. Like we're
just trying to get there and then we'll
work up from there. Now, on the real
time thing, this is one of those moments
where I'm I'm all in on Brian's right
usually. And Brian has a belief,
frankly, that Perf systems suck. And,
you know, he has this aspiration of
maybe starting another business someday
to help like companies do this better,
but that we can use a Slackbased tool to
get better real time feedback on how
people are performing in a 360 basis.
This will be the hardest change
management we have to pull off at
Coinbase because our population doesn't
love this idea of like, oh, we're gonna
great, you know, they look at as like,
hey, we're going to grade everybody
after every meeting or every interaction
or are we heading down the Bridgewater
path. Brian operates from a different
paradigm. And I think he operates from a
paradigm that actually, you know, and
this is, I think, part of the job of a,
you know, my job, Emily's job, like to
help people really understand the
context. I think Brian actually
is more worried about managers making
unilateral decisions than getting using
math, getting lots of data points on
someone and saying, "Hey, the math says
this is an amazing employee. Why should
I let this manager sort of unilaterally
rate him a one or a two, right? Without
a lot of and not and push that." Brian
is saying the law of numbers says if I
can capture more and more of the quality
of your deliverables and your
interactions and how you're operating,
the the math's not going to lie. And you
should be more fearful of one bad actor
as a manager, you know, triggering some
bad outcome for you than you should the
law of large numbers. If you're a great
employee and you're really delivering a
lot.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's so funny. It's like the these
employees have the same trap. They fall
into the same trap that a lot of us fall
into is the same old ways of doing
things and it's just ingrained and they
can't see anything else. You almost got
to like treat them like consumers,
right? They have like one use case in
their head with this and it's to screw
me over. It's like, hey, there eight use
cases for this new program. Let's talk
through them. And that's really the
change management versus the blog post.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it. So Athena, we're a
compliance company which uh let's just
put it out there that sounds pretty
boring if you think about it, right?
Okay, harassment prevention training not
very exciting, right? We are very lucky
in that we are in the HR tech space.
That's required, right? Harassment
prevention training is not really
optional. You need it. The question is
who are you going to use for it?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You're doing this training
whether you want to or not. But here's
what she told us about the impact. The
amount of impact that I've been able to
have from the HR perspective has been
just huge. It's phenomenal. We're doing
all these amazing things that quite
frankly too many companies don't do
because they don't understand the power
of their HR team.
&gt;&gt; Instead of boring check the box training
that everyone hates, Athena delivers
content that's modern and impactful.
We're talking 200 plus courses in 100
plus languages with a 93% learner
positivity rating to back it up. They
take on all the tough topics, harassment
prevention, workplace violence
prevention, code of conduct, and make
them actually engaging. And for HR, it's
effortless. Training runs on autopilot
with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
done right, like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

So LJ, Kelly and I have been talking a
lot about work trials. The one piece
about the talent density article that
for me felt like it was missing is like,
well, why aren't you actually like
getting to work with these people? So
did you guys talk about work trials and
is that something that you guys are
exploring?
&gt;&gt; We actually have at the end of our
interview process for almost all of our
roles, we give people a prompt. We ask
them to lay out like a a really basic
sort of presentation on that prompt and
then they spend 20 minutes presenting to
us and 10 minutes fielding questions and
answering those. I will say even that 30
minutes gives incredible signal on like
is someone going to be right for our
company? Are they going to think on
their feet? Can they communicate in a
way that's going to command the
attention and respect of our leaders?
And so that little window really does
help. And then I would say secondarily
Nolan my whole thing on the emerging
talent or early in career talent is
really two things. One um I think the
the the primary adopters of crypto are
earlier in career and we need more of
those people in here building products
for them. And then two I think it's the
best work trial there is in the world. I
get interns to come work with us for 12
weeks and it's birectional. I want these
interns to leave here knowing
unbelievably firmly what it's like to
work at Coinbase so they can
intentionally opt in or not. And at the
end of that 12 weeks, I think where the
signal matches where our signal says
this person's going to be successful and
where their signal says this is the kind
of place I work that b I want to work
that birectional work trial that's going
to be the very best outcomes we could
get. Hey everyone, we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors. AI change is how work gets
done. Recruiting is no exception.
MetaView is the AI platform
purpose-built for recruiting. If you're
looking to level up your AI adoption and
see real impact from intake to offer,
it's a no-brainer. Metave suite of AI
agents works for you at every stage of
the hiring process. Their platform
powers instant job postc creation, AI
powered candidate Q&amp;A, insights on
pipeline performance compensation, and
so much more. I've seen firsthand how
tough it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in candidate
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metav changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metave covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Just head over to metaviv.ai/heretics
AI/heretics to talk to one of Metav's
product experts or get started for free.
You'll be uprun an AI enabled in
minutes.
&gt;&gt; You had also mentioned earlier that uh
post the mission first article. I think
the quote you had was you were you are
trying to be more equitable and you are
now more diverse. Talk us through like
exactly what that means and how you were
able to achieve that. we um moved to a
single pay target and we said without
exception I can sit here and tell you we
have never since implementing this made
one exception. We said, "Hey, one of the
ways that we can impact diversity, one
of the ways we can remove sort of some
of the bad things that potentially
happen in the world is by not saying,
"Hey, we're going to perpetuate any
compensation differences that, you know,
women or minorities or things experience
coming out of school and through their
career and then continuing to perpetuate
that. We're going to say when you come
to Coinbase, there was one number we pay
anybody who joins." And then what we're
going to differentiate your compensation
on is how do you perform at Coinbase and
and then we focus and remove bias from
that process and we back test it and we
make sure there's no disparit impact.
And so I think that has been the biggest
differentiator.
&gt;&gt; You said you haven't made one exception
to the single pay target. I mean how how
do you hold that line?
&gt;&gt; I knew Brian and Emily when we
implemented this and the executive team
had my back because we decided we're
going to do it. So when we decide to do
something as an executive team, we don't
decide to do it except when it doesn't
work for us. We decide to do it
&gt;&gt; when it's inconvenient. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I was the DRRi or you know maybe Emily
was a DRI the D. But and any event we
are just inherently convicted that we
shouldn't be paying people for what they
delivered at their last employer. We
should be paying them for the impact
they had here. So the other thing we did
there is is we moved to this, you know,
really enhanced pay for performance
model where our top performing people
get one and a half and 2x their target
grants. It's extraordinarily
differential.
&gt;&gt; Damn.
&gt;&gt; And Brian and Emily and the company and
the board, everybody really believes in
differentiated outcomes. So, you know,
you got to take the, for the lack of a
better phrase, the good with the bad. If
you want to be able to do that kind of
high impact outcome, you can't be
compromising on the front end, right?
You guys also eliminated the four-year
stock grant in favor of the one-year
grant. What was the genesis around that
decision?
&gt;&gt; So, look, incredible volatility in
crypto, right? Our stock go from up to
 
we were also thinking about is like,
hey, we want to insulate our people a
little bit from that volatility, right?
So, in a world where I could give you a
 
spend the next two and a half years with
the stock at 75, that's going to cause
you want to talk about stress and chaos,
that's going to talk unbelievable stress
and chaos in the system. So what we
found is m by moving to this model of
annual grants, we want you to own stock,
but we don't want you to necessarily
have to ride the wave of the public
markets and how they're valuing a crypto
company. We want to give you the chance
to sort of get pricing that's closer to
the market at the time you get your
grant. I think most people have enjoyed
it, some don't, but in general, I think
it's been a huge net win for us.
&gt;&gt; I did have one more question. I wanted
to pivot a little bit to your leadership
style, LJ, and just your your
background. How are you grooming? How
are you developing? How are you pushing
your team so they can go out and do what
you do one day?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great It's actually, you
know what, at this point, I I tell
people, I don't know, I'm probably
somewhere, depending on the day, either
on the 18th T or the green of my career,
you know? I don't know. But, uh,
&gt;&gt; you me both.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But I'll tell you, the days where
I feel like going and doing the back
nine all over again are the ones where I
get like really energized about like
helping the next generation of great
CHRO's. And I gota be honest with you, I
mean, plug to I don't want my team to
get pillaged, but I think I got four or
five people that are going to be a hell
of a lot better CHRO's than I've ever
been um right now.
And look, I think it starts from a
couple of things. I think what's my
style? I think one is um you got to get
enjoyment from from seeing other people
surpass you, right? You got to you got
to you got to you have to find like this
passion for helping people unlock um
their potential. And I think that's one
of the great joys I have in doing this
job. Um I think you got to be willing to
look far and wide. I'm a big big
believer in heterogeneous teams. Uh
couple of my key directs never worked in
HR before they came. One was the head of
bisops, one was in uh growth marketing.
Couple of them are from traditional HR
backgrounds. Like you bring that melting
pot together, it makes everybody
stronger.
Um and then you know back to one of our
themes on this like intentionality. So I
try we're not always great about always
doing it but on a pretty regular basis
we have a once a week CHRO round table.
I would think of this as like in the
experience exposure education model.
It's like the exposure model where I
spend 30 minutes sort of debriefing with
them on something that only I
experienced this week as a CHRO. How I
thought about the problem, how I tackled
it, what was the upshot of it and debate
with them how they would have approached
it. I do a lot of rotations. You know, I
I just I was just talking to Emily. I
moved two people into rewards to run
rewards who didn't have a zero had zero
days background in running rewards when
they got there. And she just was telling
me like, you know what, I thought you
were crazy. I thought we had to have a
reward expert. You were right. It's
worked out. I move people around a lot.
&gt;&gt; I love that moving around. I mean, if
you want to be in the seat one day, you
got kind of go around the world.
&gt;&gt; You have to have exposure.
&gt;&gt; You have to.
&gt;&gt; You got to move around, right? So I mean
look I would say simple thing is one of
the most enjoyments I get is helping
people on that trajectory. I try to get
people who are driven and have an
interest in doing it and then I try to
create a lot of moments for them to like
lean in and grow at that rate and I'm
I'm looking forward I know I'm going to
be sitting back one day you know I don't
know what I'm doing but and I'll be
watching them publish blogs and watching
them create new things. I mean I I I
take great pride in these folks. They're
amazing. Yeah, it's awesome.
&gt;&gt; That's so cool. And it's I, you know, I
heard a leader once say, "My legacy will
be measured by the people that I've
grown and what they do next."
And that's always stuck with me and
that's the way that I've always thought
about it too. LJ, like this has been an
absolutely incredible conversation.
Kell, before we wrap up, is there
anything else that you wanted to discuss
with LJ? No, I just I love the
development of the people team. Someone
asked me at Penda what my what of my
goals were joining there three years
ago. I said I want to see six people on
this freaking team be chief people
officers in the next five years. Thanks
Nolan. This is great.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it. Hopefully they're are
they all in Raleigh? We need more chief
people officers in Raleigh. We need a
cohort here.
&gt;&gt; I'm going out next week. Let's get a
drink. But some some are. Yes. But like
you, the the heterogeneous team, they're
all over the place. So
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; LJ cannot thank you enough for the time.
I learned a ton in this conversation.
Our audience is going to be blown away.
I think that this is going to do maybe
the best numbers we've ever done and
we've had some amazing guests on this
show. Thank you for your cander and your
transparency because you know Coinbase
has this this media narrative that
basically all of us that's all we have
access to and getting it you know
directly from you on how things are
actually done there in this sort of
honest way was very illuminating for me.
So thank you for the time and thank you
for the transparency.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for the platform. It was
awesome talking to you guys. Really
enjoyed it. Thank you.
