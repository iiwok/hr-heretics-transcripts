yeah I'm rooting for you because I think
Tik Tok is a very interesting and unique
 
Tik Tok is a very interesting and unique
asset but being run you know essentially
 
asset but being run you know essentially
by the CCP right now has always caused
 
by the CCP right now has always caused
me to not have it on my phone and then
 
me to not have it on my phone and then
in addition to that I do think it is
 
in addition to that I do think it is
polluting the American children's mind
 
polluting the American children's mind
and in fact if we could design good
 
and in fact if we could design good
content to be filtered to kids I
 
content to be filtered to kids I
actually think it could be like the
 
actually think it could be like the
inverse of what it is today I think it
 
inverse of what it is today I think it
could be very net positive for not only
 
could be very net positive for not only
just our country but the world in
 
just our country but the world in
general yeah I totally agree I think
 
general yeah I totally agree I think
that you know there's a lot of tough
 
that you know there's a lot of tough
questions around that and I think that
 
questions around that and I think that
there's a prime line between balancing
 
there's a prime line between balancing
content where it's actually safe right
 
content where it's actually safe right
and the censorship right and that's very
 
and the censorship right and that's very
finally to why you see lots of other
 
finally to why you see lots of other
social media companies last few years
 
social media companies last few years
like change stances or try to navigate
 
like change stances or try to navigate
out so it'll be a fun thing we have uh a
 
out so it'll be a fun thing we have uh a
lot of great folks as part of that
 
lot of great folks as part of that
Consortium to think for the best way to
 
Consortium to think for the best way to
balance that with positive content going
 
balance that with positive content going
back to what you're saying for Shel room
 
back to what you're saying for Shel room
but also surely like a good example of
 
but also surely like a good example of
this would be like basically
 
this would be like basically
something self harm like do delete the
 
something self harm like do delete the
content or do you connect them with like
 
content or do you connect them with like
reach out for
 
reach out for
support like a notification like they
 
support like a notification like they
that Twitter and Nowa as well folks it's
 
that Twitter and Nowa as well folks it's
like your you know those thoughts right
 
like your you know those thoughts right
so I think that there's yeah deleting it
 
so I think that there's yeah deleting it
probably doesn't do a lot of good right
 
probably doesn't do a lot of good right
because that's your content for earn
 
because that's your content for earn
list I'm going get them help score so
 
list I'm going get them help score so
this the final line to walk across all
 
this the final line to walk across all
that stuff think you know a big
 
that stuff think you know a big
responsibility but I think we're kind of
 
responsibility but I think we're kind of
taking on if we get a chance I agree all
 
taking on if we get a chance I agree all
right so let's get into the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I
 
right so let's get into the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I
started with you online so you had a
 
started with you online so you had a
LinkedIn post and I'll read the post and
 
LinkedIn post and I'll read the post and
I'll read my response so your post was
 
I'll read my response so your post was
companies doing layoffs but not brave
 
companies doing layoffs but not brave
enough to cut executive compensation are
 
enough to cut executive compensation are
led by weak
 
led by weak
leaders that should be the first lever
 
leaders that should be the first lever
to pull in conjunction with Slash before
 
to pull in conjunction with Slash before
the layoffs so you quickly find out who
 
the layoffs so you quickly find out who
really wants it versus who's just
 
really wants it versus who's just
coasting for a fat paycheck and blaming
 
coasting for a fat paycheck and blaming
their team that's what you said and then
 
their team that's what you said and then

you do cut exec comp you're at a higher
risk of losing people you can't afford
 
risk of losing people you can't afford
to lose it's a symbolic move but may
 
to lose it's a symbolic move but may
cause more harm than good and then I
 
cause more harm than good and then I
think you said something along the lines
 
think you said something along the lines
of like I'm totally wrong which I
 
of like I'm totally wrong which I
probably am but I would love like to

about it for first principles
perspective instead of saying we only do
 
perspective instead of saying we only do
layoffs this way well what's the best
 
layoffs this way well what's the best
and Abstract way to think about it like
 
and Abstract way to think about it like
it achieves our goals maybe in a less
 
it achieves our goals maybe in a less
hostile way for everybody and the
 
hostile way for everybody and the
question you have to ask is is it more
 
question you have to ask is is it more
impactful for your leader that makes
 
impactful for your leader that makes
 
time or does it make more sense to just
 
time or does it make more sense to just
lay off the person that makes 100K right
 
lay off the person that makes 100K right
and I think that's a thing that folks
 
and I think that's a thing that folks
don't consider I serve in leadership to
 
don't consider I serve in leadership to
like RC dides not prepare our bills for
 
like RC dides not prepare our bills for
downturn recession we should either fire
 
downturn recession we should either fire
ourselves or we should be the ones that
 
ourselves or we should be the ones that
are taking responsibility if we can't
 
are taking responsibility if we can't
take ownership and accountability for
 
take ownership and accountability for
that and probably shouldn't go see
 
that and probably shouldn't go see
that's M yeah and I think my biggest
 
that's M yeah and I think my biggest
contribution to this conversation
 
contribution to this conversation
is why isn't it on the menu like it's
 
is why isn't it on the menu like it's
never really on the menu as far as it
 
never really on the menu as far as it
can so my take is it depends though you
 
can so my take is it depends though you
know like we talked about it depends on
 
know like we talked about it depends on
who is the leader how big is the company
 
who is the leader how big is the company
what impact would that make Etc and then
 
what impact would that make Etc and then
I was thinking about other things as
 
I was thinking about other things as
well if you're doing stuff and you're
 
well if you're doing stuff and you're
cutting your organization not cutting
 
cutting your organization not cutting
your execs and then you double down by
 
your execs and then you double down by
giving the execs a bonus like that's
 
giving the execs a bonus like that's
even a bigger Pro so I think there are
 
even a bigger Pro so I think there are
different combinations of this but I
 
different combinations of this but I
think the founder of the CE who's the
 
think the founder of the CE who's the
top I think they create a large tone
 
top I think they create a large tone
around asking these questions so we we
 
around asking these questions so we we
did this exercise at Carta during covid
 
did this exercise at Carta during covid
right so I think to your point Kelly of
 
right so I think to your point Kelly of
like are we doing layoffs as like a
 
like are we doing layoffs as like a
lever to make investors happy such that
 
lever to make investors happy such that
then I'll get a bonus at the end of the
 
then I'll get a bonus at the end of the
year I think everybody's in agreement
 
year I think everybody's in agreement
like that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up deal but like
 
like that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up deal but like
during covid we were worried our
 
during covid we were worried our
business was going to zero and we
 
business was going to zero and we
actually did bring this to Henry and not
 
actually did bring this to Henry and not
only did we bring to Henry just the
 
only did we bring to Henry just the
exact comp pay cut but we also talked
 
exact comp pay cut but we also talked
about like lowering everybody's comp in
 
about like lowering everybody's comp in
order to save jobs and Henry's
 
order to save jobs and Henry's
perspective was very interesting which
 
perspective was very interesting which
is
 
is
um his belief was look if we lower
 
um his belief was look if we lower
people's comp right now whether that be
 
people's comp right now whether that be
execs or Rank and file employees we will
 
execs or Rank and file employees we will
potentially lose the people we cannot
 
potentially lose the people we cannot
afford to lose as we go and weather the
 
afford to lose as we go and weather the
storm and so Jesse I think the
 
storm and so Jesse I think the
difference is that what appears to
 
difference is that what appears to
deeply matter to you is if the company's
 
deeply matter to you is if the company's
going through a hardship and you're an
 
going through a hardship and you're an
exec and you're getting paid 500k a year
 
exec and you're getting paid 500k a year
you also need to feel that hardship in
 
you also need to feel that hardship in
addition to the rank and file and you
 
addition to the rank and file and you
are willing to make the tradeoff that
 
are willing to make the tradeoff that
that person leaves the organization if
 
that person leaves the organization if
they are unwilling to accept that as
 
they are unwilling to accept that as
like hey we haven't performed as well as
 
like hey we haven't performed as well as
we wanted to and you have to take a pay
 
we wanted to and you have to take a pay
cut and if you don't want to do it then
 
cut and if you don't want to do it then
you're not going to be here that's my
 
you're not going to be here that's my
read on how you present it does that
 
read on how you present it does that
Encompass your
 
Encompass your
views yeah totally so I think like again
 
views yeah totally so I think like again
this is a knock specifically on Credit
 
this is a knock specifically on Credit
Karma or any other organization take you
 
Karma or any other organization take you
out that way I think uh cutting your Ace
 
out that way I think uh cutting your Ace
line I it's actually better to cut top
 
line I it's actually better to cut top
down than it is the bottom up and the
 
down than it is the bottom up and the
reason simply is also if you cut
 
reason simply is also if you cut
salaries on the bottom end you're just
 
salaries on the bottom end you're just
going to have people like morale killed
 
going to have people like morale killed
in folks
 
in folks
churning uh but I think there's there's
 
churning uh but I think there's there's
some Nuance to doing it uh top down and
 
some Nuance to doing it uh top down and
then if you still need to do layoffs
 
then if you still need to do layoffs
obviously you could but in conjunction
 
obviously you could but in conjunction
where it's like hey yeah we did layoffs
 
where it's like hey yeah we did layoffs
but we also cut our allary spray it's
 
but we also cut our allary spray it's
very different like messaging where
 
very different like messaging where
we're in this with you as opposed to oh
 
we're in this with you as opposed to oh
yeah we got a Bonus right like that's an
 
yeah we got a Bonus right like that's an
incentive right now apparently I wasn't
 
incentive right now apparently I wasn't
pry to watch I Didn't didn't know if the
 
pry to watch I Didn't didn't know if the
executives got bonus from doing layoffs
 
executives got bonus from doing layoffs
but apparently they do so I think that's
 
but apparently they do so I think that's
how we've built our culture it's a
 
how we've built our culture it's a
cultural thing and I think the culture
 
cultural thing and I think the culture
over the last few years has been very
 
over the last few years has been very
different than it will be over the next
 
different than it will be over the next
few and I think our folks lean into that
 
few and I think our folks lean into that
right we like adversity long as there's
 
right we like adversity long as there's
a path to getting made whole at some
 
a path to getting made whole at some
points whether it be through Equity or a
 
points whether it be through Equity or a
tender offer or whatever it is at some
 
tender offer or whatever it is at some
future date we true to that on our end
 
future date we true to that on our end
so I think it works and it'll continue
 
so I think it works and it'll continue
to work for us I think quite well I
 
to work for us I think quite well I
don't think everyone can do it it takes
 
don't think everyone can do it it takes
designing and ORD structure around
 
designing and ORD structure around
understanding what the long-term vision
 
understanding what the long-term vision
is and I think for most companies it
 
is and I think for most companies it
wouldn't work quite frankly but it's
 
wouldn't work quite frankly but it's
worked for us again it goes back to a
 
worked for us again it goes back to a
weak strong leadership perspective I do
 
weak strong leadership perspective I do
like the symbolic nature of it Jesse and
 
like the symbolic nature of it Jesse and
I will just Echo what I mentioned
 
I will just Echo what I mentioned
earlier what you just said it depends on
 
earlier what you just said it depends on
the leadership of that company and what
 
the leadership of that company and what
the situation is you know because if
 
the situation is you know because if
you're a 100 person company it might
 
you're a 100 person company it might
make sense to give that tight-knit exec
 
make sense to give that tight-knit exec
Team all a haircut Etc if you're
 
Team all a haircut Etc if you're
thousand person company you're going
 
thousand person company you're going

instead of giving the exec Team all a
haircut you cut the least valuable one
 
haircut you cut the least valuable one

light up the rest of them so there there
could be different aspects to that so
 
could be different aspects to that so
yeah no and I think it depends but it's
 
yeah no and I think it depends but it's
a discussion point that I think we
 
a discussion point that I think we

give you some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for it but there's
 
give you some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for it but there's
two big takeaways for me one is there's
 
two big takeaways for me one is there's
different ways to do this thing right
 
different ways to do this thing right
like not everybody does it the same way
 
like not everybody does it the same way
