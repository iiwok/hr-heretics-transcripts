## Transcript

what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today we
have a very interesting and relevant
guest if you are online at all Jesse
Tinsley you are the founder who
bootstrapped and scaled employ.com
recruiter.com before you apply Bounty
jobs.com it's now like a $300 million
Tech
Powerhouse but in addition to that
you've been I would say like very online
recently and Es especially in Tech with
you just saved bench so bench was one of
the largest SMB accounting software
companies in the United States raised a
ton of money in Venture Capital they
kind of went out of business like
overnight you came in and acquired that
company I was just listening to a
podcast with you it sounds like an all
cash deal and most recently you found Mr
Beast through I think a Twitter
Outreach and are working with Mr Beast
to acquire Tik Tok is that right do I
did I miss anything in that intro pretty
accurate and make a few caveats but
pretty close that's great great to be
here thanks for having me on I think
it's been a wild wild couple weeks I he
you told me at the beginning of December
i' be starting off 2025 the way we did
I'd be pretty surprised myself so very
happy very blessed where we're at yeah
I'm really excited to talk to you and
the reason why we're talking today is
because I started some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you on
LinkedIn which we'll get into it in a
second but like just for the audience
like is
there I did troll so much on social
these days that uh I don't remember what
you said we'll cover that in a second by
the way I'm certainly an online troll um
but like before we we get to that I am
not Jesse I said to no I'm here I'll
bring pop he's like you better get
someone to hold it yeah she's getting
involved um both of you guys are
certainly going to disre anyways so is
there any update on the Tik Tok thing
that you can give
us I yeah for sure uh so things are
pretty fluid right now we're working
pretty diligently through channels White
House proper channels there and then you
know working out reaching out to B and
representatives for Tik Tok you not
heard back I hope they realize they they
have to sell or if they should get shut
down again so that's kind of the latest
I think we're one of the Front Runners I
think there's been like some fake news
around who's actually biding on it
you're saying real
contenders that we're one of those top
two or three bits wow so and C can I ask
Jesse something Jesse I want to ask you
what what made you want to reach out to
Mr Beast on Twitter to do this i' just
love to hear your story well Mr Beast is
a great representative of like just
positive content and helping people
which a value alignment right just in
general but the reason I want to fit up
Tik Tok in general it's like nothing to
do
financially I've been pretty successful
thankfully it actually hurts me to win
Tik top I think in some ways and the
reason is like I don't actually have any
intention of being famous but if I win
this did I'd be quite famous and
recogniz this which is not a go of mine
to be honest but real the motive is like
you know lot of my my kids friends and
lots of younger generation use like 7%
of gen Z actually uses Tik Tok daily
right and so it's really to help those
folks and I think be such a positive
platform I think right now there's some
mixed feeling there by bipartisan Sports
shut down the app my mations basically
to have a a safe platform for younger
generation to have like positive content
like improving self image stuff that
that you platform that I hope regardless
if we buy or somebody else within the
next few months could be positive for
feel safe for my grand daughters to go
on it and use it so that led my Baseline
and I think that's a great outcome for
All America like our our citizens and
youth generally speaking so that was my
motivation you have some great people
like we had some Prest coming out this
week it'll show some of the people
behind us and I think that's exciting
with a lot of people with similar values
like you
mentioned like values wind up by helping
people and uplifting people and that's
our bit U it's not traditional Equity or
something else or some conglomerate or
like an ego thing for
yourself thank you for sharing that I
have teenage boys so I I get that yeah
and social media is it's an epidemic
right now in our country so actually
before we get into the stuff that I was
talking to you about online um how does
Tik Tok fit in with the rest of your
businesses and like what you're working
on yes so it would definitely be just
Standalone business so it would not be
part of the player.com but it would be
Tik Tok
us but I think generally speaking like
Tik Tok obviously it's a live for that
is around content creation and obvious a
lot of jobs and small businesses and
Brands and folks rely on for living I
think that's one of the big things like
a lot of folks that make a lot their
income off of Tik Tok they were pretty
like distra oned sh down I think that
when you think about the future of
advertising your marketing like books at
least personally like you rather Market
with like very nich influencers than on
traditional platforms or if we are going
to go on traditional platforms we don't
to Target in actual shows so it's the
same thing like things are going to
break out into going directly to content
creers and whatnot I think that's going
to continue to op Trend start way home
traditional search and more towards lm's
advertising as well as social media
advertising
yeah I'm rooting for you because I think
Tik Tok is a very interesting and unique
asset but being run you know essentially
by the CCP right now has always caused
me to not have it on my phone and then
in addition to that I do think it is
polluting the American children's mind
and in fact if we could design good
content to be filtered to kids I
actually think it could be like the
inverse of what it is today I think it
could be very net positive for not only
just our country but the world in
general yeah I totally agree I think
that you know there's a lot of tough
questions around that and I think that
there's a prime line between balancing
content where it's actually safe right
and the censorship right and that's very
finally to why you see lots of other
social media companies last few years
like change stances or try to navigate
out so it'll be a fun thing we have uh a
lot of great folks as part of that
Consortium to think for the best way to
balance that with positive content going
back to what you're saying for Shel room
but also surely like a good example of
this would be like basically
something self harm like do delete the
content or do you connect them with like
reach out for
support like a notification like they
that Twitter and Nowa as well folks it's
like your you know those thoughts right
so I think that there's yeah deleting it
probably doesn't do a lot of good right
because that's your content for earn
list I'm going get them help score so
this the final line to walk across all
that stuff think you know a big
responsibility but I think we're kind of
taking on if we get a chance I agree all
right so let's get into the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I
started with you online so you had a
LinkedIn post and I'll read the post and
I'll read my response so your post was
companies doing layoffs but not brave
enough to cut executive compensation are
led by weak
leaders that should be the first lever
to pull in conjunction with Slash before
the layoffs so you quickly find out who
really wants it versus who's just
coasting for a fat paycheck and blaming
their team that's what you said and then
my comment was the LinkedIn crowd is
going to love your post but if we're
talking about a layoff due to a business
hardship number one cutting exec comp
won't move the needle and number two if
you do cut exec comp you're at a higher
risk of losing people you can't afford
to lose it's a symbolic move but may
cause more harm than good and then I
think you said something along the lines
of like I'm totally wrong which I
probably am but I would love like to
hear your perspective on this and if
you've actually done it in practice
basically we did this in TR tr2 we
actually did this ourselves because we
set long-term incentives for a bunch of
ARX in lower like General overall cost
which basically allowed us to one do
what we've done to this point which is
grow to you know a hundred million
dollar Revenue like SAS business I think
every single te that's been with us for
more than years million dollar paper so
I think really comes down to like how
you're structuring the business I would
say most businesses probably can't do
that and doesn't move the needle as much
if you're 100,000 person company you're
doing it
for3p is right now doesn't they need all
the time but if you're a smaller
business midsize business I think that's
quite a bit of it we've seen lots of
different comp internally and what
happened in 2020 21 too is you have
these huge inflated salaries you could
look on 10ks it shows like public
statements by other companies that show
salaries right you have a lot of this
private company like seite that AR even
in my op qualified to work at a public
company like they shouldn't be paid at
that compensation level and they're
making three four 500 day like you cash
compensation that startup and I think
that's just not something that's like
stable or a future outward looking
especially when you're laying off bunch
of folks that make a fraction of that so
that's kind of where my head is with it
I think there's a lot of fat over the
last few years and you know Everyone
likes to point downward even though the
ones leading this organization so taking
some responsibility like you know over
some periods of time I've not paid
myself we're not do good I don't P
myself very different being a founder
and not being quite liquid as you might
imagine so I yes it I work a lot on
paper in theory yes but not asid is
might
otherwise said it's aesome too that
somebody's been impacted by layoffs in
different sectors and whatnot in fact
that's how my whole career started I was
laid off as a a fire fighter when I was
working as a seasonal and uh was pretty
broke uh in debt and whatnot so I think
like quite familiar with with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
on both sides spectr y birth Ming also
usually the one four hop takes that are
not popular on LinkedIn so this is the
one of the only like popular LinkedIn
post on the
essentially is like you don't need HR
like and people get really upset about
those things but this is one of my few
that's why I was so in defense of my own
post normally it wouldn't be but like
this is one of the ones like you think
I'm engagement baiting but I'm really
not I don't know I I see your argument
to be clear and you know I think one
thing that's true about online discourse
is it's tough to actually like have a
real that's why this medium is so much
better for the conversation which I
appreciate you jumping on and doing
there well we probably agree most people
agree online or like we actually get to
like at least some overlap where it's
like it's Nuance but it's just like two
sentences you're an
idiot exactly right okay so just to get
into the specifics how much salary did
like what percentage salary did you cut
from your executive team
 
uh it wasn't so much a a percent I think
it was I think it was quite substantial
I if you looked at it probably %. wow
holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay hey everyone we'll be
right back in a moment after a word from
our sponsors I must admit I used to
believe that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR that is until my friend
Heather do who leads talented signal
fire told me to check out metav I got
into the product and was like Wow AI
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruited their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead instead of
what actually happened in the interview
and I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards metav view changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out metaview head over to metav
view. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
metav View's product experts tell them
that me and Kelly sent you or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free you'll be up running and AI
enabled in
minutes so Kelly I have not talked to
you about this but I know our friend
Colleen mccre feels very firm about this
topic and agrees with Jesse and I
believe she did this at Credit Karma at
one point which is lowering executive
salaries and actually doing I think a
broad-base salary reduction in order to
save roles at Credit Karma what's your
view of the world on this Kelly yeah
it's a hard one I mean I was thinking
about this you know because I just got
when we were doing this I was thinking
about it in the car Jesse and one
question I did think and I don't really
have the answer so it was really good to
to ponder it is in my career you know
it's been 25 years of this and Venture
and other it really isn't a table Stakes
option that is on the table like it
hasn't been part of the consideration
set automatically and that is
interesting I think that's an issue and
I'm just speaking you know personally in
my experience it's never been a thing to
ponder Nolan and Jesse Yeah it's like
automatically not considered and I think
that's an issue and I I welcome you
calling that out yeah no I think that's
the same of like I went on another
podcast recently the fort podcast of
Chris Powers and I talked about our
actual organizational structure which is
very unorthodox like no one does this
structure I won't get into the details
but I think a lot of Business Leaders
get stuck like oh always do layoffs this
way always build our science way always
achieve our goals this way mean there's
really a Litany of different things to
actually go after and you just think
about it for first principles
perspective instead of saying we only do
layoffs this way well what's the best
and Abstract way to think about it like
it achieves our goals maybe in a less
hostile way for everybody and the
question you have to ask is is it more
impactful for your leader that makes
 
time or does it make more sense to just
lay off the person that makes 100K right
and I think that's a thing that folks
don't consider I serve in leadership to
like RC dides not prepare our bills for
downturn recession we should either fire
ourselves or we should be the ones that
are taking responsibility if we can't
take ownership and accountability for
that and probably shouldn't go see
that's M yeah and I think my biggest
contribution to this conversation
is why isn't it on the menu like it's
never really on the menu as far as it
can so my take is it depends though you
know like we talked about it depends on
who is the leader how big is the company
what impact would that make Etc and then
I was thinking about other things as
well if you're doing stuff and you're
cutting your organization not cutting
your execs and then you double down by
giving the execs a bonus like that's
even a bigger Pro so I think there are
different combinations of this but I
think the founder of the CE who's the
top I think they create a large tone
around asking these questions so we we
did this exercise at Carta during covid
right so I think to your point Kelly of
like are we doing layoffs as like a
lever to make investors happy such that
then I'll get a bonus at the end of the
year I think everybody's in agreement
like that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up deal but like
during covid we were worried our
business was going to zero and we
actually did bring this to Henry and not
only did we bring to Henry just the
exact comp pay cut but we also talked
about like lowering everybody's comp in
order to save jobs and Henry's
perspective was very interesting which
is
um his belief was look if we lower
people's comp right now whether that be
execs or Rank and file employees we will
potentially lose the people we cannot
afford to lose as we go and weather the
storm and so Jesse I think the
difference is that what appears to
deeply matter to you is if the company's
going through a hardship and you're an
exec and you're getting paid 500k a year
you also need to feel that hardship in
addition to the rank and file and you
are willing to make the tradeoff that
that person leaves the organization if
they are unwilling to accept that as
like hey we haven't performed as well as
we wanted to and you have to take a pay
cut and if you don't want to do it then
you're not going to be here that's my
read on how you present it does that
Encompass your
views yeah totally so I think like again
this is a knock specifically on Credit
Karma or any other organization take you
out that way I think uh cutting your Ace
line I it's actually better to cut top
down than it is the bottom up and the
reason simply is also if you cut
salaries on the bottom end you're just
going to have people like morale killed
in folks
churning uh but I think there's there's
some Nuance to doing it uh top down and
then if you still need to do layoffs
obviously you could but in conjunction
where it's like hey yeah we did layoffs
but we also cut our allary spray it's
very different like messaging where
we're in this with you as opposed to oh
yeah we got a Bonus right like that's an
incentive right now apparently I wasn't
pry to watch I Didn't didn't know if the
executives got bonus from doing layoffs
but apparently they do so I think that's
how we've built our culture it's a
cultural thing and I think the culture
over the last few years has been very
different than it will be over the next
few and I think our folks lean into that
right we like adversity long as there's
a path to getting made whole at some
points whether it be through Equity or a
tender offer or whatever it is at some
future date we true to that on our end
so I think it works and it'll continue
to work for us I think quite well I
don't think everyone can do it it takes
designing and ORD structure around
understanding what the long-term vision
is and I think for most companies it
wouldn't work quite frankly but it's
worked for us again it goes back to a
weak strong leadership perspective I do
like the symbolic nature of it Jesse and
I will just Echo what I mentioned
earlier what you just said it depends on
the leadership of that company and what
the situation is you know because if
you're a 100 person company it might
make sense to give that tight-knit exec
Team all a haircut Etc if you're
thousand person company you're going
through this I could see myself as a CEO
instead of giving the exec Team all a
haircut you cut the least valuable one
you save 350 Grand there and then you
light up the rest of them so there there
could be different aspects to that so
yeah no and I think it depends but it's
a discussion point that I think we
should be having more I guess is my
takeaway and I agree and Jesse like by
the way I do love your online content
primarily because it does like stir the
pot which I think we need more of and
this was your one take that I've seen
and so of course I had to jump in and
give you some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for it but there's
two big takeaways for me one is there's
different ways to do this thing right
like not everybody does it the same way
and that's what makes it interesting to
learn about and so Jesse I really
appreciate your way I learned from Henry
a different way at Carta and I learned
from Colleen at Credit Karma a different
way there the other thing I'll say is
like in a world that is becoming
increasingly more online I really
appreciate you willing to like jump on
and have this conversation
um because it just humanizes everybody
right it's like we're allowed to
disagree and get along and so I'm really
happy you and I can build this
relationship I'm seriously appreciative
for you having the conversation with me
and I wish more people handled it the
way that you did of course yeah thanks
for having me on I appreciate it but
it's been fun it's easy to take a
snapshot of what anyone says I think the
biggest thing is assuming good intent
online is generally my my thoughts with
a lot of things like even you know I
posted about uh zero inbox and I was
flinging myself recently on Twitter and
my inbox is destroyed right now folks
generally have good intent unless
they're purely just trolling and that
and that's a big reason why we created
this show Jesse is to to bring some of
that you know I'm behind a screen I'm
going to Flame you to to actually have a
conversation with someone and and learn
and understand different perspectives
whether or not you agree and no and I
you know we disagree the same amount as
we agree and now we can do more of this
when you have Tik Tok and you buy them
and we can go on there yeah in in all
seriousness Jesse like I'm going to stay
close with you because like I'm
fascinated by this this deal and so
thank you so much for taking the time
out of like your incredibly insane
schedule that you have thrust upon
yourself we sincerely appreciate it yeah
