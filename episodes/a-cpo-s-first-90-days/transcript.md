# A CPO's First 90 Days

## Transcript

All right. Hey everyone. How you doing?
Um Nolan and I are here for another
segment hanging out today on a Dear
Heretics Nolan. We had a doozy come in
actually this morning. Someone texted me
and I was like, Nolan and I are
recording today and I don't think we
have anything that's um pressing. So,
let's let's talk about this one, Nolan.
So, here's the readin. Hey, Kelly, how
you doing? yada yada yada. I'm feeling
excited. I'm thinking of joining this
company, yada yada yada. Purely
selfishly wondering if you and Nolan
have some hot takes or can do an episode
on the first 30, 60, 90 days of stepping
into a cheap people officer role.
There's the usual fluency of the
business, trust with stakeholders,
assessing, etc. The founder is saying
that maybe shadowing the CEO for the
first four to six weeks is a good idea.
Any hot takes or novel ideas you have
here or if this is great fodder for an
episode? I would love it. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, so this one I have a lot
of thoughts on because I have not done
it well historically. So when I was
thinking about how do how should people
think about coming into an organization?
I think there's three goals. One is
you're building trust and relationships.
Two, you're getting quick wins. And then
three, you're establishing yourself and
your brand. So that sounds great. How do
we do that? The first thing is is like
talking about the fail state. And I
think the fail state is uh like not
removing yourself from your last role.
So you're like referencing your last
role all the time. You're saying like
this is how we did things. Here's a
playbook from you know prior. It just
like doesn't matter and it doesn't land
well with the people at the new company.
Um the next thing is is like you must
overcommunicate with your CEO. So like
you guys have to be on the same page all
the time. And the hard part is is like
you're building this relationship, but
you also want to be able to tell them
like what's going on. And so I think the
best way to do that is just to send a
weekly snippet email. So like here's
what I did this week. Here's who I met
with like all of the things listed out
because Kelly, as you and I both know,
when humans don't have all the
information, they assume the worst
thing. The next is building
relationships with execs. So, you're
obviously going to be working with these
people for a long time, but like you
need more time with these people. And I
find that like one-on- ones don't cut
it. Like, you need to do lunches,
dinners, breakfast, get outside the
office, get to know what's up with them,
get to know them as people, and then
start to just click in to understand
like what's going well and what's not
going well.
Next is getting to the ground floor. So,
like execs operate at 70,000 ft. when
you first get into an organization, I
think you got to like do both. And
that's I think this is the modern exact
we've been talking about this, but you
need to talk to as many people as you
can, especially the top performers and
your team. Um, one of the things that
friend of the show, Colleen McCreary,
did when she joined her her new role is
that she had like a hundred one-on- ons
in the first 90 days. like it's actually
not that crazy when you think about the
calendar and how you can do those
things. So, I love that tactic. I also
love her tactic of sharing those
learnings
uh with the exec team and then also
potentially the redacted learnings with
the broader company. Um, as part of
this, you should be like making
assessments on your team. I think you
got to be really careful about making
assessments for people that are not on
your team because you don't really know
what's going on. Um, in addition to
that, like getting to the like the
ground floor with customers.
So, joining sales calls, joining
customer support calls, like figuring
out like what those people are doing and
how they're interacting with the
customer base is huge and acting like
there's no job beneath you. Um, as I
mentioned, quick wins, like it's so
important to be putting like wins on the
board right away because otherwise
people just wonder like what the hell
are you doing here? And then last thing
is building relationships with the
board. And you got to be delicate about
this because these relationships
typically have some baggage or things
that you don't know about. And so you
got to talk to the CEO about it. You got
to make sure that the CEO is very much
in line. But I think that's like the
that's the hierarchy for me.
Love it. So I I replied back to to this
friend because I'm in it right now. I
said, "Well, that's incredible because I
just got back from two days in Seattle,
um, where Studio's headquartered, and I
literally like presented this plan at
the exact staff on Monday." Um, and so
I'll lead with I think you hit on this a
little bit. Um, is tell tell everyone
regularly and often repeat it what what
you're going to be doing um, and and why
you're going to be doing it and how
you're going to be doing it. like that
transparency is really important. So, I
presented four things. It literally said
first 90 days. Um 1 2 3 4. And the first
one, you hit on some of these, Nolan,
and I'm just going to go through it
because this is how this is how I'm
going to architect it in practice. So,
first of all, backing up before I even
started. I pushed myself into it wasn't
hard, but I was like, "Hey, I haven't
even started yet. Let me jump on your
all hands meeting in August for seven
minutes.
And I literally just had one slide uh
talked to the company about who I am
personally as well as professionally,
how I work, why I'm stoked to be here,
and gave them a heads up on how I'm
going to spend my time. Um, and I said,
you know, I'm not I'm not I'm not the
regular HR person of a cool like
remember the mean girls quote, I'm not a
regular mom, I'm a cool mom. I was like,
listen, I'm I want to meet with you all.
I really want to understand what's
important to you, what's happening,
what's going well, and where where we
might have some gaps as we grow. And
also get to know the business. So, if
you don't throw time on my calendar,
I'll throw time on yours. And when that
happens, don't like, you know, read into
it or freak out, which can happen. Um,
so again, that that spirit of telling
everybody from the CEO all the way down
how you're going to spend your time and
most importantly why you're doing that.
Okay. So, the four-point 90-day plan for
me is listen and learn. Set that up. Um,
I'm going to have one-on- ones with
every single person in the company.
There's 140 of them today. Fine. Um, the
second is execute quick wins. So, we all
know when we start jobs and any any
functional lead role, there's on
fire. There's stuff that that needs to
get done that hasn't. There's stuff in
flight that might be heading for a
dumpster fire, right? there's things
that that have been causing frustration
or pain um in the company for a long
time, usually with the CEO and the
leadership team, and jump on those. The
third is shaping long-term strategy when
you're doing that. You're not going to
have that answer the first 10 days, but
as you're doing those first two
activities, you should be having a point
of view on how the next 12 18 months
might look, how you're thinking about
setting up your people team pillars,
what those focus areas are going to be
and how they connect in with what's
happening with the business um as you
learn more about the business and you
attend board meetings or talk to people.
And the fourth is building your
scaffolding, right? building your people
team or else you'll die. Um because a
lot of CPOs jump in the seat and they do
all the things outside of the people
team to try and build trust and execute
and whatever it is and they look back 3
months later and they still have the
same team and maybe there's not enough
of them. Maybe they're not all great.
Maybe the talent compos compositions
wrong and all of a sudden you're behind
and it's literally like standing in
quicksand and you'll fail. Now the
of it is and this is the reality. I'm
just going to say it. You have to do all
four of those things at once.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And you have to do them in the first
three months.
&gt;&gt; And what that means, I told someone
yesterday in Seattle, I said, "Listen, I
kind of gave my family a heads up."
Like, it is what it is. You got to you
got to just get crushed and run on the
hamster wheel at 3x speed the first 3
months to do all four of these things
very well at the same time
or I think you're toast, you know? And
then once you do that, after those three
months, the 3x speed, it it if you if
you do it correctly, it jumps down to
regular speed.
&gt;&gt; And then if you do those things
correctly, nine months later, you might
be at 80% of that. And that's where you
then you can spend a lot of your time
innovating, influencing, to your point,
spending more time with the board,
right? You're not like in the doing
tactics all day long.
Um,
&gt;&gt; I I strongly agree. What I would say is
like the first 90 is a huge sprint, but
you're also in a marathon. And so I love
the the tactic of telling your family
and setting the expectation with them
like you're not going to see me. The
other one is is like you still need to
take care of yourself. And for, you
know, for me, what that means is like
I'm sleeping 7 8 hours a night. I'm
eating well. I'm working out. like you
have to do those things because if you
don't people can feel the the energy and
your energy has to be like elite when
you walk into the to the building. Um,
one more is like what I heard from Henry
at Cardos, who's Carter CEO, which I
thought was like really interesting and
true and uh, it's not obvious, but you
know, when you come into an organization
and you see things on fire, I think a
human's first response is like, "It's a
 show." Like, can you believe this
joke over here? And you got to be really
careful about that because you don't
know what decisions they had to make in
order to get them to where they are
today. And I think reframing that
slightly as opposed to like it's a
show or it's a tire fire to like hey
like this is a problem like this is
something that we can solve over time
and like I can't even imagine the
decisions you guys had to make to get us
to this point. Like thank you for doing
that. I loved when Henry said that to
people because it really uh it really
brought something to me that I was like,
"Oh my god, I'm totally doing this. I'm
looking around being like, "That's on
fire. That's on fire. That's on fire."
Versus like, "Okay, like this is what's
going on. Like, I appreciate all the
work you guys have done."
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Really fast on the on the building a
team though, Kelly. So this one is
&gt;&gt; before you go there just just like
&gt;&gt; just to that point it's so real because
&gt;&gt; it I was I was so first of all I was in
Seattle for 48 hours. Everyone's like
why why' you go why why are you up for
two days only? Why don't you just wait?
To your point about telling your family
I'm like listen I I got to fly up there
on Sunday. Everyone's going to this
summit this annual thing on Wednesday.
There there is a window there because
I'm not going to be back for a couple
weeks. There is a 48 hour 12-hour a day
window that I am ready to to influence
some things and push some chess pieces
forward. Meaning I have had enough
information that I can go up there now
and sit with the CEO and sit with the
leadership team on Monday and talk about
my plan and get buying on that. Do you
see what I mean? Like you have to jump
on these moments because if I didn't do
that, it'd be 2 weeks later and now all
of a sudden we're 30 days in and no one
knows what's h. So to your point, you do
have to sacrifice a little bit um to to
to find and and capitalize on these
moments as you're onboarding. It's
really important um it would have been
just as easy to say, nah, I'll just
wait. So
&gt;&gt; yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nuranho. She
put it so simply. HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it.
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
which uh let's just put it out there.
That sounds pretty boring if you think
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
prevention training not very exciting
right we are very lucky in that we are
in the HR tech space that's required
right harassment prevention training is
not really optional you need it the
question is who are you going to use for
it
&gt;&gt; exactly you're doing this training
whether you want to or not but here's
what she told us about the impact
&gt;&gt; the amount of impact that I've been able
to have from the HR perspective has been
just huge phenomenal we're doing all
these amazing things that quite frankly
too many companies don't do because they
don't understand the power of their HR
team.
&gt;&gt; Instead of boring check the box training
that everyone hates, Athena delivers
content that's modern and impactful.
We're talking 200 plus courses in 100
plus languages with a 93% learner
positivity rating to back it up. They
take on all the tough topics, harassment
prevention, workplace violence
prevention, code of conduct, and make
them actually engaging. And for HR, it's
effortless. Training runs on autopilot
with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
Done right like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

Get 10% off of your first year. Your

single expense. But without the right

while I was up there to your second
point, literally live at least six
times, people have told me, "Are are you
are you glad you still joined? You're
coming back. It's such a it's such a
mess." And I'm like, "Dude, you're 140
people. You just jumped in I can't even
tell you cuz it's confidential, but in
revenue and valuation in a very short
amount of time, you just closed your
series B like two weeks ago.
You should be drinking champagne." Like
what? So again, it's it's about to your
point like just building on this this
great this great stuff that these these
companies have built and um taking them
to the next level. So
&gt;&gt; yeah, the other thing you're doing
though, right, that I missed is like
you're spending in person time. And so
regardless of if you're remote or hybrid
or even if you are in like you must meet
in person. Like that's how we connect as
people is like we trust more when we can
experience that person in real life. And
so like you flying to Seattle is such a
great example of like whatever it takes
to make sure like I can be around the
humans. Um
&gt;&gt; I love that.
&gt;&gt; I do want to talk about building a team.
&gt;&gt; Yes. cuz like that's it's like a it's a
dangerous game. And so I have a couple
thoughts on this. One is is like know as
much information as possible before you
walk in the door, right? And so you can
already start to kind of have like a
couple of dots on the map for where
things are at ideally with your CEO. So
before I joined Carta, I actually put
together like a proposed org chart of
just like, hey, I don't know if this is
what I'm going to do. I'm gonna get in
there and get my hands dirty, but high
level, this is ultimately what I think
it will look like. End state. What do
you think? And just proposing those
things early so there isn't any
surprises when you ask for headcount
because I do think there's a there's a
sound bite on execs who want to come in
and, you know, build these gigantic
orgs. Uh, and so you you want to avoid
that, but you also need to be very
cognizant that like time is ticking and
you need to get wins and part of your
wins is hiring great people.
&gt;&gt; Totally. Um, to your point about in
person, I I can't stress it enough. It's
a really really great great piece of
advice is do unnatural things if you
have to to to get inerson time with the
right people. Um, I achen it to like
making tenure in academia. Do you know
what I mean? Like you invest all that,
you don't have to do it as much later.
Um, but even like I was talking to Jerry
this morning and about some spicy stuff
and I I guarantee you that spending the
amount of time I spent with him two days
ago in person on Monday
made that conversation easier and able
to get to that spicy point. It it
wouldn't have been bad, you know, still
would have been straight up, but it just
felt like I'd been at the company for
three months.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. And you can't you can't
replace it.
&gt;&gt; Totally. And building that building the
team, to your point, I I again, I can't
stress it enough either. Get getting
your together. You cannot build the
rest of the house unless yours is is
somewhat in order because what will
happen at the very best is that you'll
continue to tread water, but you'll be
doing it.
&gt;&gt; You'll be dying. You'll be burned out.
&gt;&gt; You'll be in the middle of the
organization working from the inside up,
down, left, right, and you'll probably
be viewed as not really strategic
because you're in there just pushing
doing stuff all day and doing tactics.
So, it's going to, you know, impact your
brand, I would say.
Um, and at the very worst, you're going
to fail because
&gt;&gt; they're either going to be like, "What
are you doing?" You know, you're, you
know, counting beans and know the
organization. I need you to I need you
to think where we're going 18 months
from now. So, you have to build your
scaffolding very quickly. This is where
your networks come in. This is where,
again, back to the hamster wheel. I
hadn't even started. I was like, I don't
care. Ship me a laptop. Like, let me get
set up. let me get to know what's going
on here. Um because it's like your own
business, right? If you turn your back
on your own business, it's going to
fail. So, you just have to kind of be
obsessed with it for a while,
&gt;&gt; you know? Um and then being picky about
that. You can't come in to a series B,
C, even D company and say, I need four
directors and I need three mid. Come on.
Like, one, you got to do stuff. You got
to get your hands dirty. You got to
prioritize your hires and say look I
need these two and I'll make it work for
six months. I I don't know what it is
but you have to to do that and then you
have to tell people in ways that is not
HR speak or corporate speak what you are
doing right I said listen I think we got
four pillars here the next 12 18 months
and it's not like talent acquisition and
or development and engagement it's
listen the these these pillars are grow
these pillars are hire these pillars are
cultivating our workplaces and our
culture you guys want open offices and
it's scale and it's AI I native and it's
efficiency and you speak in the these
terms that are not HR and you talk about
it in terms of where where the pain is
and what we're trying to do as a
business that gets you the resources.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. You could even start with
like this is what I heard or this is the
problem and this is my proposed
solution, right? And just again like
plain speak like a third grader would
understand gets everybody aligned
because you're right when you do use uh
HR vernacular or any vernacular
depending on whatever org you're in you
just start to lose people and it's like
a it's a low trust signal
&gt;&gt; for folks
&gt;&gt; and that's the litmus test right like I
plan to go in front of the company next
month and talk about the same exact
stuff I just talked about on Monday and
there's your test or they could just be
like be staring at you like your kid
does like what are you talking about.
&gt;&gt; Um, and that's the way you reach these
companies, especially these early stage
companies where
&gt;&gt; the these folks are, you know, some of
them it's their first second working
experience. So, talk to them as if um,
you know, they they don't know what
you're doing or why you're there.
&gt;&gt; Y
&gt;&gt; the question here, Nolan, she asked she
asked shadowing the CEO. I'd love your
take on this. I'll go after you, but
there's a specific question or or
suggestion to shadow the CEO for four
weeks.
&gt;&gt; Uh four weeks seems like a lot of time
to do that. Uh I I think I like it as an
idea. I think actually I like it. I
think you should do it, especially if
they're offering it. It's clearly
something they want you to do, so you
should lean in and say yes. But you
can't not do the other things. like both
things must be true of what we're
talking about here and doing that. I
think four weeks sounds like a lot
crazy, but actually like if you're
shadowing the CEO and assuming this
person is like on the ground a lot, then
you're going to be able to take care of
like all the customer things or the
support things, right? The the product.
And so I actually can see a ton of
benefits that basically solve a lot of
the things that you and I are talking
about, but I can't it's just not one
thing, right? You got to do it all.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. my take on it. Uh, one, I'd be
like, what does that mean? Because I
don't I don't know if the CEO wants to
like every meeting. Am I
&gt;&gt; Are we walking home together? Are we
having dinner with the family? What what
are we doing here?
Uh, I will tell you again just in in
real experience, in my mind, uh, what
that means is is the CEO, founder is
probably one of the top three people
you're going to spend your time with.
Uh, the first 90 days. I've been talking
with Jerry every day. um every day and
in my mind that's kind of shadowing.
You're kind of like two in a box in some
way on a lot of things. Um we send audio
text messages. I I tell you no one this
guy is a an an AI genius. He's like a
technical and he's like I just want to
tell you this is my first audio text
I've ever sent in my life. He taught me
how to do this and he sends me every two
days and I'm like oh my god no one texts
anymore. So, there's a lot of um what
I'm trying to say with that is there's a
lot of quick turns. There's a lot of
frequent quick communications uh versus
well, let's wait for our 101 on Friday.
They don't want that. The these want you
the right ones want you to be in there
&gt;&gt; and to the this text this this question.
Um live with them, so to speak.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Quick quick feedback loop for sure.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. MeteView is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
Metav's suite of AI agents works for you

Their platform powers instant job postc
creation, AI powered candidate Q&amp;A,
insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes
all of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
MeteView covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing

Metaview. Just head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts or get started for free. You'll
be up running and AI enabled in minutes.
So, so I'm doing exact search right now
and one of the thing that's that's
coming up surprisingly a lot is
candidates who have for whatever reason
it's not working for them in their first
like 3 to 6 months and the the market
feedback right now is like a little bit
of like a bait and switch situation. So,
like the company overpromised something
like this is where revenue is or this is
how our sales cycle is working and all
of a sudden like they click in like whoa
whoa whoa like that's not what you told
me in the interview process. How do you
think about stuff like that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, one I I don't think those
things are ever fully defensible. I just
don't like I think that if you're going
to be in this game and you're going to
join especially first time founder CEOs
early stage I mean it's it's a risk and
even if you think you've you've been
bulletproof like I think I've I did a
lot of things there's going to be stuff
that bobs and es and weaves and changes
and curveballs and again it's the
character and disposition of of the
leader you are and the one that you're
partnering with. Um, and that's what I
kind of sus out most. It's not their
their absolute answer on things because
that's just not reality. It's it's how
they approach things. It's are they
agile? Are they flexible? Are they good
human? Are they open? So, um, I spent
at at at this company, Supio and Pendo,
I hung out with this founder CEO for
over six months on and off. Yeah. What I
mean by that is usually one, two
conversations a month, a lunch or a
whatever in person. I spent two days
straight in July up in Seattle on my own
dime just with the team. Um, and you can
ask for those things. I think it's
important.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. I still think though,
Kelly, it's happening way more than I
expected. I don't know if it's just like
the new breed of company or the new
breed of founder. And so what what I've
been telling my friends when it happens
is like you need to to sit down and have
the conversation of like hey this is
what I'm noticing this is and name the
thing this is different than what we
talked about and then you need to make
the decision for you of like okay
expectations must be reset because
otherwise if your expectations haven't
been reset and you're walking into
something that is clearly different than
what you discussed how can you be
successful right everyone's going to be
missing aligned and so I think you need
to continue to have alignment
conversations. I do love your take
though which is like
there's always unknown unknowns like
nobody knows nobody knows everything
going into a job. You're lucky if you
know like 60%.
&gt;&gt; And so you just have to roll with those
punches especially as an executive. It
just comes with the territory.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I was talking to a search firm the
other day. I actually love your take. It
was two days ago and they're like you
know there's a data point and the
average I won't say the role but for
this pos the average role for this CXO
in this stage of company is 9 months
and I was like
&gt;&gt; that's wild
&gt;&gt; what um and and I'm not trying to prove
or disprove that my my meta point is
like sometimes it doesn't work and I
just think that that those conversations
are less taboo now and I don't think
that um unless you're you know being a
prick and like not being flexible and
you're part of the you know most of the
problem I don't think that this should
be a combative thing that that you beat
yourself up for. So and I think part of
having that be cordial and mature and
all the things where people don't beat
themselves up is to do exactly what you
said is just talk early and often name
the thing um and find out sooner versus
later. Finding out at four months is
better than finding out at 10 months.
You know what I mean? Because anyway,
&gt;&gt; really well said to have it on your
thing, you don't lose that much time.
So, I think trying that but
&gt;&gt; totally agree.
&gt;&gt; The other thing on that is board
members. So, like I'm lucky. This is my
third Sapphire portfolio company. I've
known two of the board members across
three companies now. And that can really
help you um you know ha have some air
cover, have some other places to bounce
things off of and and also do a lot of
diligence. So that that's helpful, too.
&gt;&gt; Even out, you know what I mean? Like
&gt;&gt; Well, ex Exactly. And but there's also
no substitute for time in relationships.
And that's like a great example of like
if you have a bunch of relationship
depth,
&gt;&gt; it reduces the risk of like these
unknown unknowns. Yeah. That are going
to like potentially like harm you and
and harm your ability to have success in
the work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess my last thought that that
goes back to the first 90 days and you
know, we talked about the four buckets.
Listen and learn, short-term wins,
long-term strategy, and then building a
people team. Um, as part of the
long-term strategy, like what I've been
doing the the last three weeks, um, is
just being conscious as you're going
through the other three buckets, what's
coming together for you for the story?
Um, and what I mean by that is what are
you going to say at the next board
meeting? What what is um the story of
the organization, the culture, the
business? How are you mentally
connecting those things to your your
pillars and the work you're doing and
the metrics? So,
as an example, right, I I joined last
month of Q3, right? This is that means
the board meeting will probably be in
October. The Q3 board meeting will be in
October. What am I going to say for for
that? And so, as I'm going through this,
it's just for me, it's like a working
whiteboard, but it's a it's an evolving
whiteboard sketch of our Q3 QBR for the
people team. um which ties to the story
of Q3 and the rest of the year into Q4
and 2026. So you can you can do all
these things at once smartly. I guess
what I'm saying you don't have to spend
 
one number two you can mix and match
these things together in a storyline
that helps you have a clear point of
view um and is more efficient in in the
hamster wheel so to speak. Yeah. So like
&gt;&gt; some people do that by by taking a
journal by the way of just like every
day just kind of like writing down some
learnings and stuff like that just so
you're collecting the thoughts as you
go.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I have a Google doc and I
write like in paragraphs like blah blah
blah blah blah insert metric or number
blah blah blah blah we're going to
insert metric or number. So you get you
get context for for these numbers versus
just all this charts you're
doing the 11th hour or no one you know
what I mean? So
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; This is a really good one. Yeah, love
it. A lot of beating here for you guys.
Hope you enjoy it.
&gt;&gt; All right, thanks everyone. See you
later.
