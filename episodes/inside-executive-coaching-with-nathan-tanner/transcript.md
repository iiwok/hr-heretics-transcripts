# Inside Executive Coaching with Nathan Tanner:

## Transcript

 
For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, executive coach Nathan Tanner
shares transparent revenue numbers,
client acquisition strategies, and why
operator experience trumps weekend
certifications.
 
All right. Hey everybody, welcome back
to HR Heretics. Today we have Nathan
Tanner joining us as a guest. Nathan was
at LinkedIn before joining Door Dash as
an HR leader. He was then the head of
people at Neighbor and is now one of the
best leadership coaches that I know. So
Nathan, thanks so much for joining us.
Nathan, actually where I want to get
into is with coaching. And why did you
want to become a coach?
Yeah. So I had actually when I moved
into HR, I met a couple of coaches. It
was actually first at LinkedIn. I was
responsible for vetting coaches for this
high development, high potential
leadership program that we had. And I
just thought like that would be the
coolest job ever. The coolest job. But
it wasn't until I had this experience at
Door Dash that I really started moving
in that direction. Um, like Door Dash
was an incredibly rewarding place to
work. It was a very challenging uh time
period and challenging role for me. And
I just had this moment a couple of years
in where I just felt completely
stretched and I couldn't stretch
anymore. Like work responsibilities,
personal responsibilities, we had three
kids at the time, we have four now. uh
church responsibilities, just like
everything came crashing down and I
literally found myself one Sunday
morning like on the floor like crying
uncontrollably and it hit me so hard of
like I can't do this anymore. Like I got
to get my stuff together. Like if I'm
going to show up for other people, I
need to better take care of myself. And
so I actually went out and and hired a
coach. I worked on a lot of different
things and the experience I had working
with a coach plus all the HR experience
that I had put me on that path to then
ultimately becoming a coach and helping
people who are in situations like that
where they're struggling with work and
all the responsibilities to uh uh to
make real progress.
&gt;&gt; So help the audience understand like
what does a good coach actually do?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so high level, any coach
you're going to work with is going to
help you accomplish your goals. But what
I have found is a lot of people who are
like completely in over their heads and
in the biggest job they've ever had
before, whether they're a startup CEO,
head of people, whatever it may be, and
they're like, "Something needs to
change." But if you work for the company
and you're like the HRBP leader to an
executive or even the head of people,
you're working with the CEO, it is a
very different relationship than someone
who has been hired from outside of the
company to come in and and work with
them. And so the level of vulnerability
I get with the clients that I work with
is 10x what any leader at Door Dash
neighbor LinkedIn was was going to give
me. Like I'm going to push on the leader
to an extent, but ultimately like my my
job's kind of on the line where right
now I'm a coach. I'm working with 13
different clients. You think I'm an
idiot. I push you too far. You fire me.
Okay, cool. But like you are paying me
specifically to do this job and so like
I can push you and I can say things to
you that someone who is in an HR
leadership role may not be able to to
get away with.
&gt;&gt; Nathan, tell us about in your mind what
makes a great coach and how should a
potential client assess for those
traits?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, I think the first the first
thing that makes for a great coach is
experience. Like you don't need to be a
coach for 101 15 years, but like you
have to have been in the arena doing
interesting things. Um, like I I I think
being an HR leader is a great place to
go. any sort of operator where you're
like at board meetings in the
conversation when like really meaningful
uh topics are being discussed like that
level of experience where you felt that
weight and you feel like you might be
like breaking down or really challenged
that I think is really important and a
lot of coaches don't have that which we
can come back to in a second so like
that's it the second piece I would say
is training
Can you ask powerful questions? Can you
build trust with the person that you're
working with? I think empathy and
intuition are also very important.
There's a level of accountability as
well. And like a successful coach
requires three jobs. The first is to
find clients. Like you have to be able
to find people and persuade them to work
with you. The second is you actually
have to coach them which is where most
of the people spend time on. Then the
third is like you are running a business
assuming you're a self-employed
individual which I think most coaches
are. Like you have to send invoices, you
have to figure out your taxes. Like you
have to run the business around it and
like if you are just good at one or two
of those things um like it's not it's
not going to work out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a debated topic. You know,
one of the issues that I have with the
proliferation of coaching is that you
have a bunch of people who have no
experience in the arena.
&gt;&gt; I call them like the weekend warriors
who now, you know, they went uh on
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and now
they're a certified life and executive
coach
&gt;&gt; and they're out there telling people who
are actually building real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how to
operate. Like for me, that feels like a
complete it's a miss. Um and it just
doesn't seem like relevant at all. As I
think about what you need, how you
should go about assessing a coach, it's
first and foremost like what have they
actually done? Does this person
understand the unique challenges
that I am going through? And this is why
I often work with startup CEOs because
like I have been there like I know what
it's like you know you need to be in the
arena. Have you operated at that level?
Do you know the environment? What you're
saying there is like you have lived life
as a startup operator such that now you
are uniquely qualified to provide advice
to people that are going through that
journey themselves.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And in this world that matters a lot. I
mean you just it it it's everything. And
no one's going to hire you for to talk
about theoretical models. They want you
to help them get through the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
because you've done it before and you
can help them see around the corners.
And I I am a I am a trained certified
coach. Uh I can walk through
credentials. I don't think that is the
end- all beall. No one ever asks me like
where did you get certified? What was
that process like? How thorough was it?
They do all of the time ask me tell me
about your experience at Door Dash. Tell
me about your experience at Neighbor or
coaching other people who are in similar
situations to me. I lead from the
perspective of a coach. And what I mean
by that is I lead with questions. I
challenge assumptions. I'll call BS if I
see it. Like I am a trusted thought
partner, but I will like take off the
coaching hat and provide advice when
people are ready for it and say this is
what I've seen at past companies. And
that I think is a tricky balance because
if you just lead from experience and
advice, I don't think it's super
valuable. But if you only lead with
questions, like that's not going to work
either. And so it is a tricky balance of
like when do I bring in the advice piece
versus like keeping what I call the
coaching hat on.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I've worked with three coaches
now personally and I find that in the 9
to 12 month range I have like extracted
 
what they're going to tell me in the
session is my take is is like that's the
time to like go and get a new coach and
see if there's like uh other tools that
I need to add to my tool belt. And so
I've said u in the past that I think you
should fire your coach every 9 to 12
months. What's your take on that?
&gt;&gt; All of my engagements start with six
month commitments. Generally we renew
for another six months. Nolan, it's
funny. I went back and looked at the
data of the average tenure, if you will,
of my clients, and it is just over one
year. And I hope that this is a
relationship that ultimately you
graduate from or move on from and in
your mind you're thinking, "Oh, I wish I
had a session with Nathan right now. If
I was going to ask him this question,
what might he push me on or what advice
might he give?" And like maybe I can
shortcut this and figure it out myself.
But the coaching relationship
uh can at times like get a little bit
stale. So, I love starting with new
people and building that building that
relationship and figuring it out over
time.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. MetaView is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level

Their platform powers instant job post
creation, [music] AI powered candidate
Q&amp;A, insights on pipeline performance
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. MeteView changes
all of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.

&gt;&gt; How do you how do you find new people,
Nathan? Like how how have they come to
you? Um what's your limit, right?
Balancing quality and quantity
&gt;&gt; in terms of finding clients
early on when I was going through the
certification process. I had to hit a
hundred hours of coaching and it had to
be paid. It built relationships and so
now those people have referred me to
others and that continues to happen. So
number one source of new clients is
current or past clients. Um I'll get a
decent amount of introductions from VCs.
Uh which has been really helpful. What
hasn't worked? I joined this coaching
marketplace and I won't share the name
but like it was the most arduous process
to like get selected and get picked. Um
and I was like cool once I make it I
won't have to worry about business
development like clients are just going
to be like referred left and right and I
have gotten zero clients from that.
There are a lot of promises and
opportunities around like you know easy
easy business development or easy
opportunities or so it seems but like
almost everything has just come from my
network from people from people that I
know and those are relationships that
have been built over over decades.
&gt;&gt; You have to build your own book like
there there is just no substitute for
building your own book.
&gt;&gt; So So you guys you guys put out a an
excellent episode. I'm gonna I'm gonna
plug you guys if that's okay. an
excellent episode on networking and if
you have not listened to that go back
and do it. We have underinvested in
networking and building relationships
and staying in touch with people that we
like and like that is that is really
really critical. It's Yeah, I It's so
funny you said that, Nathan, because I
was just thinking about that episode in
my head um right before you said it. But
I can't tell you again, even now, I
mean, I had someone last week say, "Hey,
we worked together like eight years ago.
I'm in this new role. Can can I can you
help me like once a month, something
like that, right?" And and all these
folks are now leaders from 15 years ago,
and they remember you from these
companies and or you help someone just
altruistically. It's it's it's probably
one of my biggest passions in this
industry. So,
&gt;&gt; definitely.
&gt;&gt; Amen.
&gt;&gt; Definitely.
&gt;&gt; All right, Nathan, let's continue with
the the economics of coaching. So, talk
to us about like, you know, when you
were a W2 employee, you know, you're
making a good tech salary and then you
go become a coach. Like, what were your
expectations and what is actual reality
for you?
&gt;&gt; This is a very uncomfortable thing to
talk about. I'm happy to do it because I
think that this is a black box for many
people like we we just we just don't
know what people make in various roles
in various industries. And so for me
when I was at Door Dash uh the salary I
had around the time I left was 240k
that was cash comp that excludes equity.
And when I launched my coaching
business, my goal was like, okay, I'm
not trying to optimize for income, but
there is a certain level I need to make
to like take care of my needs. Um, and
so very first client that I worked with,
uh, this was before I made the jump was
a three-month engagement for 1,500. Um,
$1,500, three months. Um, I made the the
kind of which which which isn't which
isn't that much. And if you're building
your business on engagements like that,
it's not it's not going to work. But
that engagement led to lots of others.
And so I think one of the things you you
didn't ask is like what should you be
doing now if you ultimately want to
launch a coaching business or consulting
business. and that is to start doing it
on the side and start getting
comfortable and familiar with charging
people money even if it's not ultimately
you know what you're what you're going
to so um January through July of 2022
while I was doing this kind of on the
side um during that seven-month period
my business did 22k
um in August of 2022 I made the
full-time jump into coaching and during
the last five months of that year uh I
did 120K. Um so for the year I was
around 142. Um 2023 was my first full
calendar year being a coach. Um and the
business did 335K
that year, which quite frankly I was I
was really really happy with. My goals
were much lower because like the first
year I'm like I don't even know if I can
do this. I'm gonna set aside enough
savings to figure it out and like I want
to do this. I hope we can do this and
let's let's let's go for it. Um 2024
may be lower than 2023. Uh Q1 was better
than any quarter I've had in the past.
Um right now I'm we've talked about the
book a little bit, but like I'm I'm
really focused on like making the book
as successful as possible. So I've
actually reduced the number of clients.
I had 16 was my peak. Um, right now I'm
at 11. Um, and that's, you know, that's
somewhat intentional.
&gt;&gt; That's that's awesome. And, you know,
for those of us, myself included, you
know, thinking about at some point going
independent into consulting, right? That
 
money, but remember that's not your
salary at Door Dash when your benefits
are covered, everything else. So, you're
you're having to fund a lot of stuff out
of that. So, it's not uncommon for even
a 500k annual salary to kind of be just
enough considering all the other things
you have to do on your own.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's it's a great point, and I
found that it's really lumpy. So, I
often will charge clients
uh the full amount, full kind of
six-month fee upfront. Sometimes it's
split across three different payments.
And so I have months sometimes that are
larger than the next three months.
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
&gt;&gt; And and it's very different like you're
in a salaried role and you get your your
paycheck and you can manage to that
where me like if all the money comes in
and I go spend all that money like I'm I
I might bring in 2,000 the next month
and it's like okay well now I'm uh now
I'm in a world of hurt. So
&gt;&gt; I love this. I love how we're
demystifying this because it you're
right it has been a black box.
Everyone's like, "Oh, these fancy exec
coaches, they're making all this money.
What are they doing?" So, it's actually
very helpful. And how do you get these
rates? I mean, is there a compens
for executive coaching? How do you know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it's a really good question.
So, I I heard uh in the research that I
did, I saw this. I remember when I was
making the jump that the average coach
makes 50K in their first year
and 30% of coaches don't make it past
year one. Um, and so like it it can be
really hard. I know coaches who are all
over the place. You know, a 100k for a
six-month engagement or coaches who are
like a very very very small fraction of
that. Um, and so I I I share this not to
say this is good, this is bad. It's
really a wild wild west. And so there
isn't a compens.
talked to coaches and some of them I've
built a relationship and they've they've
told me where where they're at. Some are
much much higher than than where I was
at last year. Others others are lower.
Um, and I think it also really depends
on like what are you optimizing for?
Like if you're trying to maximize
individual compensation,
this may not be the route for you. You
may be better off going out and getting
a getting a corporate job. The other
thing I've noticed even with consulting
as we've seen it through continuum is
that every single one of these
consultant markets are N of one like and
so it is are you in demand? Is your
specific skill in demand? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so like the rates we've seen just I
mean there the delta is massive between
the top end and the low end.
&gt;&gt; And it's the number one question we get
is like well what should I charge? And I
always tell people is like, well, if
you're asking that question, it should
be lower than you think
&gt;&gt; because if you don't know the answer to
that question, you don't have enough
reps and you don't have a line out the
door waiting for you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And once you start building your book
and you have a line out the door, that's
the time to start increasing rates.
&gt;&gt; One of one of the things I was
optimizing for was uh the number of
clients that I had. It wasn't revenue. I
wanted to get to 10 clients as quickly
as possible. I intentionally went after
seed, series A, series B CEOs who were
underserved and had never hired a coach
before. Every time I talked to a startup
CEO, their decision was, do I hire
Nathan or do I do nothing? And so then I
I came in at a rate that like some of my
coaching friends would laugh at. Uh and
I'm like, I don't care. That's not what
I'm optimizing for. And so over time I
have been able to I still work with
startup CEOs a lot but I've been able to
work with larger companies where you can
charge a higher rate.
&gt;&gt; One last question on that like do you
need a bunch of fancy collateral right
websites and this and that.
&gt;&gt; I I am on LinkedIn obviously I created a
landing page. It's nathan tanner.net you
know it's just my name. I think that is
I think it's good to have a landing
page. Like my writing's on there, but
like it's not fancy. I mean, I might
have invested
$1,000, 1,500 into it. Like you could
spend 10, 15K, way more than that, and
create a beautiful, beautiful website.
Um, and I just don't think it's
necessary. You get to larger companies
and it often is very different. and
you're working with an HR leader and
they're like, "We only hire coaches at
this rate." Um, then I think a website
might be a little more valuable. I have
a three-pager that I've put together
that has my bio, my perspective on
coaching, a few endorsement endorsements
from clients, and I'll send that out to
people. You should set a certain number
of hours of like, this is how much I'm
investing in collateral, and no more.
you should be talking to people or
coaching people or interacting with
people like that. That's that's where
it's going to to come from. The number
of people who have just randomly reached
out from my website, I might have gotten
one client of all of the people that
I've worked with.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Networking and word of mouth. Just
&gt;&gt; that's it. Yeah. Nathan, this has been
incredibly helpful. Um I really
appreciate your transparency. I know it
can be taboo to talk about these topics,
but you know, as um you you know my
manager from Door Dash, Andrew Monday,
he told me how much money he made in the
IPO, and he and I'll never forget it. He
said, "I'm not telling you to brag. I'm
telling you so you can learn what to do
when you make this much money."
&gt;&gt; And I think the same is true in this
situation for all um coaches either out
there right now or people that are
thinking about coaching or even clients.
Uh this is super helpful information for
people. Um one last thing I just want to
compliment you on as a friend. You and I
have been having these discussions for
probably like four or five years and I
remember going back to when you know you
were really thinking about it and it was
a tough time in the economy and I
remember giving you advice. I was like
dude I don't know like
&gt;&gt; you told me not to do it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I was like I don't know right
now. Um like it's really bad out there.
And what I love about what you did is
that you burned the boats and you went
all the way in. And I think if more
people do that in life when you when you
forge into the unknown and you don't
know what's going to happen,
&gt;&gt; you become more resilient.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And in your case, you have seen success
and obviously it is because you've
burned the boats. But even if you don't
see success, burning the boats, I think,
teaches you a lot about yourself. And so
it's been really fun as your friend to
watch your journey. I appreciate that. I
appreciate that. Yeah, I've I've tried
to play the long game, and I think this
is this is a space, probably any space,
but especially this one, you have to
play the long game. You can't be needy.
Like, the client needs to need the coach
more than the coach needs the client.
That's the only way it's going to work.
Um, but anyway, I I I really appreciate
that.
&gt;&gt; Well said. Well said. Thank you, Nathan.
This is awesome.
&gt;&gt; Appreciate the time, man.
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So,
&gt;&gt; have a good one.
