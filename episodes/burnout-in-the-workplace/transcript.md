all right everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics hope you
all are doing great Nolan and I are here
and we've been talking about this a bit
Nolan we were at the responsive
conference in Oakland recently got some
questions from some audience members on
just the current state there's a lot
going on in the world right now here in
the US in the tech industry other
aspects AI all the things it's very
heavy and a lot of folks not just HR
people right leaders employees humans
are just kind of not feeling it right
now and I think I've seen more posts on
LinkedIn this last year about are you
tired are you burn out than I have in
the you know what I mean like the
previous seven years and I don't want to
keep us going down the down the negative
Vortex I want to talk about what do you
do how do you keep going how do you keep
positive excited um not in a duckies and
horsey motherhood and apple pie type of
way but like for real like how does that
work for you and what have we heard from
others yeah so I'm interested to get
your take on this too Kelly but I don't
think any of the stuff I'm about to say
is sexy nor is it a
Panacea and so so for
me you know if you guys have been
watching this show I basically this
shirt is the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shirt just I
wear different colors I remove decisions
as much as I possibly can because it's
just like I don't want to make that
decision and so Tech bro you're like oh
my God but I just don't want to think
about what I wear like boom that's one
of the things easy for me did you go to
a high school with uniforms is that a
thing too or my actually actually no but
my son goes to one we thought we'd hate
it turns out we actually really like it
um but the the other thing I'll mention
is like I it's kind of in this area of
discipline in life and so every day I
work out I have to work out every day I
walk my dog and I get outside I have to
do that every day I sleep a minimum of s
seven hours I'm shooting for eight as
I've gotten older like I'm feeling like
I have to have that I have to like get
up and work on the most important thing
and then I have to spend time with my my
little homies my kids and you know those
things it's not sexy it's just like my
routine the other is is eating well and
I find that like being able to do that
stimulates me I get excited I keep going
now for sure I have bad days and when
that happens I think the biggest thing
is one trying to be kind to myself and
then two leveraging my best friend who's
my wife to talk to her about it um and I
think you know in this era of social
media we actually don't have real
community and that is what the world is
in desperate need of and I find that you
know with my wife with my parents with
my best friends I'm able to lean on them
and have these real conversations and
tell them like what's really going on
with me and so when I am in one of these
modes I lean on people and I think
that's what humans are supposed to
do yeah you know I I
have pulled back a lot on social media I
think that can be a force for good I
think it could also be a force not great
um the personal aspects I think are
really important um did you ever and and
be kind to yourself I can tell you like
how many people in the past two years
like see see therapists right I do you
know Etc preventative care and the
biggest phrase I hear is be kind to
yourself and you know I think it's a
phenomenon here especially in the work
we do and the intensity of it and even
the US in a lot of ways culture it's go
go go it's you're not good enough and
that is it's a real phrase is to be kind
to yourself because I don't think we
always are I haven't been enough in the
past and that permission you know helps
a lot so the personal pieces 100% did
you and one thing I'm talking to to
folks about that I work with now or
coach now when you were in the inside
when you were inside yeah not that you
were in jail but you were um you know a
door Dash SE part a separate story
different segment it's fine
um like how do you get your mojo back
when you're in these jobs these CPO
roles these HR leader roles even you
know business leadership roles inside
these companies where sometimes it just
feels like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] room that's
collapsing on you and the people are
bugging you maybe the strategy's not
going well there's a lot of and and how
do you deal with that when you're in
these corporations how do you get the
energy keep it yeah this is where
playing baseball I think is like really
shaped my life because um there's a
saying that if you fail in baseball
seven out of 10 times you go to the Hall
of
Fame and you know it's it's actually
that way in business too I mean you try
and be better than 50/50 but you're
going to get a lot of things
wrong and I think what often happens is
our negative selft talk makes the
problem significantly worse m h and so I
think the negative selft talk is
actually the problem to solve because if
you can remove the negative selft talk
then you realize it's it's never would
they say it's never as good as you think
it is and it's never as bad as you think
it is yeah and so how do you gain
perspective when you're in those moments
I think the first thing is just
awareness and so practi is like to have
more awareness of like when you're
talking to yourself and it's negative I
meditated like every day for 18 months
when I was at door Dash I was in the
most stressful situation of my life I
was in a job that like was bigger than
anything I had ever done I was in a
company that was growing incredibly fast
and I was constantly in fear of them
layering me that was my day every single
day and so like I had to figure out
these outlets in order to continue to
survive and build my internal resilience
meditation was a great practice for me
I've since actually moved to like more
breath work stuff which is awesome
there's an app called other ship I
strongly recommend it's incredible but
the other thing is that provides me
perspective is putting the phone down
and getting into nature one of the
reasons uh I forced my wife to move to
Utah is because the mountains have this
effect on my soul that almost nothing
else has outside of the
ocean and so I can 10 minutes away from
my house I can be in the canyon and I
can be in the mountains and I can like
put my phone away and I can just go
breathe and walk there and then I come
back and I'm like oh my God I'm thinking
about this problem differently there's a
lot of like philosophies of around going
for walks and how like when you go for a
walk especially without technology you
come back and you start looking at
problems a lot differently and they're
shaped differently and you're looking at
them from different angles so that's
what I do what did you do Kelly yeah
well let me ask you and I love this by
the way very self-reflective very
emotional here on your personal J like
some
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dealt with it yeah I love it we're
switching roles a little bit here and
it's great those are really helpful and
I'm just I'm wondering if you can be a
little bit vulnerable here in these
companies what was that negative selft
talk because if I was listening to this
I'd be like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what' you say to
yourself like what was it you know what
does that look like because I bet it's
similar for a lot of us listening yeah
um I'm not good
enough they're going to layer me they're
going to fire me I'm going to be exposed
as a
fraud um and look I mean some of it is
imposs syndrome right like you as you
build your community amongst your peers
in the same role at other companies you
start to realize and I strongly
encourage you to do so because you start
to realize that everyone has this
thinking and I also thought that if I
didn't have an answer to something I was
like stupid or
incompetent but it turns out you don't
have all the answers to things like
that's why you build a team that's why
you build a community of people you can
lean on so yeah that was the stuff that
was going through my head time yeah that
tracks with everything that that I used
to say as well hey everyone we'll be
right back in a moment after a word from
our sponsors Real Talk most Talent
leaders haven't yet cracked how to
leverage AI for Meaningful impact on
their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting team's efficiency and quality
use metav view metav view is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and trans transcribes
hiring conversations like intakes
interviews and debriefs then provides
perfectly summarized notes of everything
that was discussed that means your
people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
quora and check out medavie head over to
metav view. a/h Heretics to talk to one
of metav View's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled in
minutes and it's so funny about having
the right answer you know what I mean
cuz I feel like now H being the person
that always has the answer and knows it
all is actually not a good thing like it
it's a leadership virtue to not know
everything and to hire people that are
smarter than you and to know one to say
I don't know which we've talked a lot
about on this show over the past year so
I find that really interesting because I
don't think that really was the case
like 10 years ago Tony said one of the
things I really stuck out about one of
the things Tony said to me was like the
smartest people he's ever met say I
don't know all the time but they say I
don't know and this is how I'm going to
figure it out right right yeah you know
about the ride I I always tell folks too
in these companies it's super important
like never to get too high or too low
it's the biggest thing because they're
roller coaster rides and if you allow
yourself right the highs never get too
high and the lows don't get too low stay
right in the middle as much as you can
because it won't just whip you up and
down every week or two weeks it's
literally every hour like you'll just
get whips s and so to just kind of stay
steady is really important but I have a
take like cuz what I've struggled with
is this Echo chamber right for those of
you who are maybe been with a company
two three plus years you're with these
freaking people all the time right more
than our families you know maybe in the
last three years things haven't been
great so you do layoffs and the
company's growing sub 10% maybe or not
growing you know and
it can become really tough and I I
personally have kept the Mojo up and the
the energy up by getting perspective
outside of the
company and I think that right that Echo
chamber can become very monotonous it
can start bringing you down right and
then the selft talk comes in and then
the whole thing keeps perpetuating in
the wrong direction and I always tell
people like dude take a recruiter call
it at least once a month talk about
yourself don't atrophy around your
experiences like and it's kind of like
the Walks Like You go through those
emotions and you're talking to a
recruiter or you're speaking on a panel
or you're attending a conference and
meeting new people and you get that
Swagger back you're like oh I do know
what I'm doing I have choices I'm out
there like I'm not just kind of stuck
here and withering away in misery this
place and for me that's been really
helpful is to just
continue to not just believe but get
proof points that you're relevant you're
good you're out there you're learning
you're in the mix and bringing that back
to your company again it's like the
Walks Like You see these people that
might have been bugging the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of
you 3 months ago you see them
differently it's like a refreshing type
thing where you approach things
differently and people feel that energy
I talked to a chei people officer
yesterday Kelly yeah who was like going
through this they're in this what is it
the eternal battle between Chief people
officer and CFO around what their Equity
should burn should be H and she was just
like am I crazy and I just started
talking to her about like hey I've
experienced this and like oh by the way
like you know once you hire an exec you
blow out the whole goddamn budget and
she was like oh my god that's literally
what we did and I was like it turns out
that's how everyone and so when you talk
to other people you start to realize
there's actually like these shared
problems which makes it feel less like
the world is is coming in on you and
more oh my God like I I have brothers
and sisters in arms who are going
through similar challenges and getting
this is where it's like asking for help
is a super prob what you do this so well
I like the things I'm learning from you
I think one is like you ask for help all
the time and you do it in this way
that's just like everyone wants to help
you and the other thing that you do this
is a story I tell myself you tell me if
this is true or
intention is like you are so thoughtful
about relationships
and so when times get tough I assume
that you're actually like your
foundation is this relationship with the
other
human
yes and it enables you to solve problems
because it's like look we trust each
other and we have a deep relationship
versus I think what's happening
underneath the thing for other folks is
the relationship isn't solid and when
the relationship isn't solid and then a
problem arises then you start to get
cracked all over the foundation yeah
well I I think yes that is true and I
think you're hitting on something that
people might not agree with me with but
I think it's like the fundamental way
that humans work and is is the quality
of relationships I don't care if it's
like business or science or school or
family like if you are fake about
relationships it it is apparent do you
know what I mean and so you can't fake
that you have to actually you know and
so if you don't want to do that with
someone go find the the right people you
know because you do get energy back from
that and I do think times are change
like 10 years ago like I don't know I'll
speak for myself but the HR communities
they were like I'm not sharing this I'm
not sharing that still think it's a lot
like that I still think it's tough but
it was more weird it was competitive and
like it's so powerful to not care about
that and have literally have no agenda
and be like whatever like we can all go
up the ladder you know we can all go
down the ladder like let's all help each
other like that comes back and so I
don't know I just leave the group with
like when I started to feel like I was
in that Echo chamber in these companies
and I was just withering I started to
play defense a lot I was playing a lot
of Defense I was right how do I protect
this how do I not get fired how do I not
make a mistake like when you start
feeling like that you got to change it
because that's the downward Vortex that
we're talking about and you know I think
that other people outside are the best
way to to get that mojo back and if
you're not great at relationships fine
you don't need to like lean other people
go talk to a recruiter go get some
Swagger back out there and get some
confidence like it's
amazing how subconsciously you bring
that back into the companies that you're
working at and people see that they feel
it it might be body language it might be
right how you're walking it might be
it's your energy and like people I'm not
like a shaman or witch but like people
feel that and I think it it impacts more
than we might even be aware of yeah my
my two aunts are yoga teachers and they
talk all the time about energy and it's
so true like you do feel someone's
energy do I just started taking yoga
like a month ago so oh that's another
thing is like I'm telling you like
sweating there's something around just
like going and sweating it just changes
the way your brain processes problems
and this teacher like kicks off every
class with some five minute story
about and like the elephant gods and I
kind of ir rolled and now I can't wait
for my five minute stories so I have
three more thoughts one is a book that
changed my life is ego as the Enemy by
Ryan holiday and the essence of the book
is it turns out like inflated egos is
the thing that most of us are trying to
protect and once you just let that guard
down like talk about being real is
that's when like realness really starts
to happen and that's when problems
the the perspective of problems are are
really shaped for you the other thing is
I started reading history and man you
know I think we do this thing to where
we inflate our problems and I think
social media like doesn't help with this
at all like I think like we just put a
magnifying glass on our problems and one
of the things that that history does for
me is holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these people had it bad
yeah like oh my God you think we had it
bad holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what I was reading about
like Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War or
like Winston Church Hill in World War II
the amount of stress these people were
under is unbelievable and it makes you
feel like you can do it because other
people have done it yeah and then third
thing is on that I was listening to a I
was listening to a podcast the other day
and you know I I don't I'm going to
paraphrase but the main message was like
get over yourselves like we get so bad
out of shape and air we're in the
airport in the airplane's 30 minutes
delayed and we go crazy and huff and and
they're like really and it just kind of
that little silly story clicked for me
cuz like yeah I get annoyed when the air
airplane's delayed and then I just
connected it to what you were saying
about how difficult were yeah like
you're you're literally getting into
this giant tube that's going 600 miles
an hour to get you to a place like 100
years ago it's like oh my God can you
imagine if we could do that and now
we're bitching about the process I mean
sometimes it's just as simple as get
over yourself you know which is hard in
the moment but it is and it's the other
thing I'll say is you know gratitude
I've said this a few times on a show
like I didn't grow up with money and in
fact we grew up with the opposite of
money and when I'm in one of these
moments like I I my wife and I try and
hold each other accountable on this and
it's important to have an accountability
partner and I think like marrying up is
the most like the the biggest life
advice I could give anybody but just
thinking about where you came from and
thinking about like the problems that
you're solving right now and it turns
out it's not all the time but like man
we solve a lot of first world problems
in today's world and when it comes down
to it the things that really matter is
like it's your health it's your the
health of your loved ones and it's can
you put a food put food on the table on
a roof over your head and we've done a
really good job in this country of
marketing other Lifestyles that people
want my favorite one of my favorite
quotes is comparison is the thief of joy
and I think a lot of us myself included
have to fight that urge and really think
about what matters and be grateful for
what you have
yeah so thanks for the therapy thanks
for the therapy session great great
