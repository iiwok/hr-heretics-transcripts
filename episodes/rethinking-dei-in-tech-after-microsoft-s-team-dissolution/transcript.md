talking about Dei and everyone was like
 
talking about Dei and everyone was like
oh my gosh it's so important and now you
 
oh my gosh it's so important and now you
just see these companies and everyone's
 
just see these companies and everyone's
doing the same
 
doing the same
thing the question is why it's so
 
thing the question is why it's so
confusing to me um and I'm a little
 
confusing to me um and I'm a little
frustrated
 
frustrated
because the the work is important like
 
because the the work is important like
the the the goal of all of this is in
 
the the the goal of all of this is in
fortun and you saw all these tech
 
fortun and you saw all these tech
companies so committed kind of trying to
 
companies so committed kind of trying to
out do each other on the commitment
 
out do each other on the commitment
scale and hiring for this and then less
 
scale and hiring for this and then less
than you know 5 years later you're
 
than you know 5 years later you're
seeing one by one oh they're doing it
 
seeing one by one oh they're doing it
we're going to cut it we're going to cut
 
we're going to cut it we're going to cut
it it just it's disheartening to me
 
it it just it's disheartening to me
Dolan because I feel like if that's
 
Dolan because I feel like if that's
happening that fast now they really
 
happening that fast now they really
didn't believe in it back then that's
 
didn't believe in it back then that's
the only conclusion I can come to is it
 
the only conclusion I can come to is it
was Faith right it was posturing and we
 
was Faith right it was posturing and we
had to do it because everyone else is
 
had to do it because everyone else is
doing it or we'll look back and that
 
doing it or we'll look back and that
that's just turning to me for Tech
 
that's just turning to me for Tech
actually is my reaction I'm just
 
actually is my reaction I'm just
literally reacting live as this is
 
literally reacting live as this is
coming out of my brain but that's my
 
coming out of my brain but that's my
reaction so let me let me give you
 
reaction so let me let me give you
another couple of points to think
 
another couple of points to think
about one is please I think that this is
 
about one is please I think that this is
a referendum on the tactics that Dei has
 
a referendum on the tactics that Dei has
used for the past call it 10 years and
 
used for the past call it 10 years and
you know these tactics I think we're
 
you know these tactics I think we're
having a societal moment to where we're
 
having a societal moment to where we're
evaluating these tactics if morally we
 
evaluating these tactics if morally we
believe they're right and
 
believe they're right and
secondly if they are efficacious like
 
secondly if they are efficacious like
are they working and if you look at all
 
are they working and if you look at all
of the Dei reports there has been at
 
of the Dei reports there has been at
best marginal Improvement in
 
best marginal Improvement in
representation and I think like Mo most
 
representation and I think like Mo most
honestly almost no improvement and in
 
honestly almost no improvement and in
some case some cases actually it's worse
 
some case some cases actually it's worse
so you have two things at play here one
 
so you have two things at play here one
is like how are we going about trying to
 
is like how are we going about trying to
solve this problem and the second is is
 
solve this problem and the second is is
are we actually solving the problem
 
are we actually solving the problem
so when I when I see Microsoft say
 
so when I when I see Microsoft say
something like we are committed to you
 
something like we are committed to you
know we're still committed to to Dei I'm
 
know we're still committed to to Dei I'm
with you I don't believe them I will say
 
with you I don't believe them I will say
though I think Tech is having a moment
 
though I think Tech is having a moment
and and candidly in our country right
 
and and candidly in our country right
now is having a moment is if we are
 
now is having a moment is if we are
trying to solve this problem too
 
trying to solve this problem too
late so my take here is actually we need
 
late so my take here is actually we need
to solve this problem much much earlier
 
to solve this problem much much earlier
in someone's life and when I was at
 
in someone's life and when I was at
Google uh we were building a data center
 
Google uh we were building a data center
in uh Monks Corner uh South Carolina and
 
in uh Monks Corner uh South Carolina and
it's like an hour outside of Charleston
 
it's like an hour outside of Charleston
it's like it's like way in the sticks or
 
it's like it's like way in the sticks or
at least was 10 years ago when we were
 
at least was 10 years ago when we were
doing this
 
doing this
and as part of putting the data center
 
and as part of putting the data center
there Google wanted to help kids uh
 
there Google wanted to help kids uh
become native in software engineering
 
become native in software engineering
and so we hired like 30 teachers
 
and so we hired like 30 teachers
and we deployed those teachers with
 
and we deployed those teachers with
their own curriculum across multiple
 
their own curriculum across multiple
schools for seventh and eighth
 
schools for seventh and eighth
graders that for me is something that
 
graders that for me is something that
actually will not affect Google's
 
actually will not affect Google's
diversity report next year or the year
 
diversity report next year or the year
after or the year after that but that
 
after or the year after that but that
for me actually feels like the right
 
for me actually feels like the right
level of work to do given that it's at
 
level of work to do given that it's at
the community level and given that it's
 
the community level and given that it's
at the level to where we can help these
 
at the level to where we can help these
kids much much earlier than trying to
 
kids much much earlier than trying to
reverse engineer things towards the end
 
reverse engineer things towards the end
of a hiring process right it is logical
 
of a hiring process right it is logical
and I I do agree that the things that
 
and I I do agree that the things that
have been in place have not been
 
have been in place have not been
effective as as we would like however
 
effective as as we would like however
and you've seen this and I I just
 
and you've seen this and I I just
haven't in these articles with all these
 
haven't in these articles with all these
companies cutting it now I don't see
 
companies cutting it now I don't see
anything in its place of here's why
 
anything in its place of here's why
we're we're doing this and here's how
 
we're we're doing this and here's how
we're changing our approach
 
we're changing our approach
like that's what the frustrating thing
 
like that's what the frustrating thing
for me is is it's it feels like just a
 
for me is is it's it feels like just a
cutting versus I totally agree we're
 
cutting versus I totally agree we're
we're we're cutting this to replace it
 
we're we're cutting this to replace it
with this or try this
 
with this or try this
or that that's what's missing for me
 
or that that's what's missing for me
and I just think you know I think Tech's
 
and I just think you know I think Tech's
had a long history of of companies kind
 
had a long history of of companies kind
of copying each other and doing this and
 
of copying each other and doing this and
I just feel like we've we've swung it
 
I just feel like we've we've swung it
back and we're seeing these folks do
 
back and we're seeing these folks do
this and I I want to see what it's
 
this and I I want to see what it's
replaced with I just not not read any of
 
replaced with I just not not read any of
that yeah it's a good point I mean I
 
that yeah it's a good point I mean I
think in in Microsoft's case like they
 
think in in Microsoft's case like they
have committed something along the order
 
have committed something along the order
of like $150 million annually to to
 
of like $150 million annually to to
diversity topics now how they deployed
 
diversity topics now how they deployed
that and what are those programs and
 
that and what are those programs and
where do they show up like no one
 
where do they show up like no one
actually knows right like they they're
 
actually knows right like they they're
not telling us they're just giving us
 
not telling us they're just giving us
this number um but I'm I'm I'm actually
 
this number um but I'm I'm I'm actually
I think it's a really good point Kelly
 
I think it's a really good point Kelly
I'm with you I feel
 
I'm with you I feel
like we've been lied too especially by
 
like we've been lied too especially by
big big Tech like Google Microsoft meta
 
big big Tech like Google Microsoft meta
they've all said that this is incredibly
 
they've all said that this is incredibly
important to them and now we're seeing
 
important to them and now we're seeing
them cut the teams that were owning
 
them cut the teams that were owning
these
 
these
initiatives and we're not and and the
 
initiatives and we're not and and the
only thing we're seeing out of them is
 
only thing we're seeing out of them is
like here's our Dei report you know
 
like here's our Dei report you know

again another year another year of like
 
again another year another year of like
no changes yeah yeah what are they doing
 
no changes yeah yeah what are they doing
like do because you could say that you
 
like do because you could say that you
really care but your actions is what
 
really care but your actions is what
actually matters and I'm with you I
 
actually matters and I'm with you I
think you're exactly right that these
 
think you're exactly right that these
actions feel
 
hypocritical right and and I it's also
 
hypocritical right and and I it's also
it's also makes me sad because there
 
it's also makes me sad because there
were good things that have been done
 
were good things that have been done
like to just throw all this out and say
 
like to just throw all this out and say
it wasn't helpful at all I think is a
 
it wasn't helpful at all I think is a
little a little naive uh and and talk
 
little a little naive uh and and talk
talk talk more tell me more about what
 
talk talk more tell me more about what
what do you because I I tend to agree I
 
what do you because I I tend to agree I
I think intent was certainly good but
 
I think intent was certainly good but
like what do you think actually
 
like what do you think actually
worked I I do think there are soft
 
worked I I do think there are soft
tissue type of
 
tissue type of
improvements in how
 
improvements in how
companies got better right as far as how

they interacted with people the
 
they interacted with people the
inclusion the no the no tolerance on

folks not treating folks with respect
 
folks not treating folks with respect
like I do think if you look at you know
 
like I do think if you look at you know
I'm I'm used to in 2013 2014 kind of the
 
I'm I'm used to in 2013 2014 kind of the
rise of this this bro culture in San
 
rise of this this bro culture in San
Francisco and all these companies that
 
Francisco and all these companies that
actually did really terrible things and
 
actually did really terrible things and
and acted bad behavior right I think a
 
and acted bad behavior right I think a
lot of that was turned and had
 
lot of that was turned and had
spotlights on it through de programs or
 
spotlights on it through de programs or
articles or again and I was involved in
 
articles or again and I was involved in
some of them so I I do think that if I
 
some of them so I I do think that if I
compare 2014 to
 
compare 2014 to
 
to speak as far as the behaviors the
 
to speak as far as the behaviors the
ethos kind of the the vibe in these
 
ethos kind of the the vibe in these
companies and I think that's a really
 
companies and I think that's a really
good thing and I don't I don't want to
 
good thing and I don't I don't want to
lose sight of that because we don't see
 
lose sight of that because we don't see
numbers changing enough right if if
 
numbers changing enough right if if

of type companies now and I just don't
 
of type companies now and I just don't

amount at which it happens is so much
less than what we experienced 20 30
 
less than what we experienced 20 30
years ago and historians yes have said
 
years ago and historians yes have said
this many times that if we you know it
 
this many times that if we you know it
always feels if you're just looking
 
always feels if you're just looking
right now in living where your two feet
 
right now in living where your two feet
are it always feels like things are very
 
are it always feels like things are very
tumultuous and things are crazy but if
 
tumultuous and things are crazy but if
you actually reflect on where we are in
 
you actually reflect on where we are in
history it's never been as good as it is
 
history it's never been as good as it is
today that's just what historians say so
 
today that's just what historians say so
I think you're you're totally right yeah
 
I think you're you're totally right yeah
that we have made significant progress
 
that we have made significant progress
specifically with how we interact with
 
specifically with how we interact with
each other and how inclusive cultures
 
each other and how inclusive cultures
have become especially with differing
 
have become especially with differing
viewpoints um and you know different
 
viewpoints um and you know different
backgrounds and different races and
 
backgrounds and different races and
different genders and different
 
different genders and different

David hanahand said this it's like it's
 
David hanahand said this it's like it's
never going to be done there's never a
 
never going to be done there's never a
Finish Line the question is is how does
 
Finish Line the question is is how does
this work how does this work continue as
 
this work how does this work continue as
part of chapter two I I love the way
 
part of chapter two I I love the way
you're thinking about it and I don't
 
you're thinking about it and I don't
think it's acceptable for these big tech
 
think it's acceptable for these big tech
companies who have made these promises
 
companies who have made these promises
over the course of the last five to 10
 
over the course of the last five to 10
years to be like sorry we're just
 
years to be like sorry we're just
cutting the team and we don't have an
 
cutting the team and we don't have an
answer for you we should hold them more
 
answer for you we should hold them more
accountable um my take is if I was them
 
accountable um my take is if I was them
and if I was you know leading a people
 
and if I was you know leading a people
team right now inside of a tech company
 
team right now inside of a tech company
my take would be we're integrating this
 
my take would be we're integrating this
work into everything that we do what
 
work into everything that we do what
really matters to us is inclusion what
 
really matters to us is inclusion what
really matters to us is hearing
 
really matters to us is hearing
different viewpoints of creating an idea
 
different viewpoints of creating an idea
meritocracy of ensuring that there is no
 
meritocracy of ensuring that there is no
discrimination inside of our Workforce
 
discrimination inside of our Workforce
and I think that's what we're going to
 
and I think that's what we're going to
see but the silence on what happens
 
see but the silence on what happens
next is unacceptable from these big tech
 
next is unacceptable from these big tech
companies because we looked to them as
 
companies because we looked to them as
the everyone models after their behavior
 
the everyone models after their behavior
yeah right and and I've said this for
 
yeah right and and I've said this for
you know my 24 years in in Tech we have
 
you know my 24 years in in Tech we have
the most one could argue the most
 
the most one could argue the most
resources the most money the most power
 
resources the most money the most power
to push the envelope and lead the way
 
to push the envelope and lead the way
for for others that need to be better so
 
for for others that need to be better so
if we pull back from that who's going to
 
if we pull back from that who's going to
do it freaking Banks aren't going to do
 
do it freaking Banks aren't going to do
it so like that's right that that's
 
it so like that's right that that's
that's why I'm pushing this because if
 
that's why I'm pushing this because if
if if we get lazy and fall back it's
 
if if we get lazy and fall back it's
going to give it's going to put everyone
 
going to give it's going to put everyone
out like you know what I mean we're
 
out like you know what I mean we're
we're leading the way and we're raising
 
we're leading the way and we're raising
the bar and we're forcing others to do
 
the bar and we're forcing others to do
this and to your point about the story
 
this and to your point about the story
about your mom like I think that is some
 
about your mom like I think that is some
of the biggest biggest examples of the
 
of the biggest biggest examples of the
progress we've made it's not in the
 
progress we've made it's not in the
numbers or the quotas or the percentages
 
numbers or the quotas or the percentages
it's in these stories and the these
 
it's in these stories and the these
again these qualitative atmospheric
 
again these qualitative atmospheric
experiences that I I think should be
 
experiences that I I think should be
more of chapter 2 um because that leads
 
more of chapter 2 um because that leads
to the percentages right you get more of
 
to the percentages right you get more of
these stories all of a sudden all these
 
these stories all of a sudden all these
women want to work at this company and
 
women want to work at this company and
then the percentages follow so I I think
 
then the percentages follow so I I think
there's something along the lines of
 
there's something along the lines of
like the qualitative environmental kind
 
like the qualitative environmental kind
of Behavioral thing around this uh for
 
of Behavioral thing around this uh for
chapter two and we've just LED with got
 
chapter two and we've just LED with got
to move the numbers got to have an
 
to move the numbers got to have an
affinity group and now we're diverse
 
affinity group and now we're diverse
it's like doesn't it's just silly um I
 
it's like doesn't it's just silly um I
agree the numbers and the numbers
 
agree the numbers and the numbers
haven't moved and and so you know I I do
 
haven't moved and and so you know I I do
