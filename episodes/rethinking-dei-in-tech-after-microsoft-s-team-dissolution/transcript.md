# Rethinking DEI in Tech After Microsoft's Team Dissolution

## Transcript

 
[Applause]
hey everybody welcome back to another
segment of HR Heretics today we're
talking about the most recent news in
Dei which is that Microsoft has
reportedly fired its entire de I team
now we've been talking about this since
January Kelly and since we started
talking about this there have been
multiple companies zoom snap Tesla door
Dash Lyft Home Depot
Wayfair Facebook Google that have all
downsized or completely removed their
Dei teams so now Microsoft is the most
recent in this what's your opinion on
this top
topic I I'd love to just kind of opine
on this together I'm sure those who are
listening are having the same kind of
what the hell is happening this this
article says a Business Insider leaked
an email from a team leader sent to
thousands of people stating at Microsoft
the Dei was no longer business critical
and then a spokesman after that said our
Dei commitments remain unchanged our
focus on divers inclusion is unwavering
and we are holding firm on our
expectations prioritizing accountability
and continuing to focus on this
work well my reaction is how how are you
doing that it to me that said nothing so
I just it's so interesting like the the
the human kind of aspect of kind of
birds of a feather do you know what I
mean like back in you know 2018 2019 20
you couldn't you couldn't walk without
talking about Dei and everyone was like
oh my gosh it's so important and now you
just see these companies and everyone's
doing the same
thing the question is why it's so
confusing to me um and I'm a little
frustrated
because the the work is important like
the the the goal of all of this is in
fortun and you saw all these tech
companies so committed kind of trying to
out do each other on the commitment
scale and hiring for this and then less
than you know 5 years later you're
seeing one by one oh they're doing it
we're going to cut it we're going to cut
it it just it's disheartening to me
Dolan because I feel like if that's
happening that fast now they really
didn't believe in it back then that's
the only conclusion I can come to is it
was Faith right it was posturing and we
had to do it because everyone else is
doing it or we'll look back and that
that's just turning to me for Tech
actually is my reaction I'm just
literally reacting live as this is
coming out of my brain but that's my
reaction so let me let me give you
another couple of points to think
about one is please I think that this is
a referendum on the tactics that Dei has
used for the past call it 10 years and
you know these tactics I think we're
having a societal moment to where we're
evaluating these tactics if morally we
believe they're right and
secondly if they are efficacious like
are they working and if you look at all
of the Dei reports there has been at
best marginal Improvement in
representation and I think like Mo most
honestly almost no improvement and in
some case some cases actually it's worse
so you have two things at play here one
is like how are we going about trying to
solve this problem and the second is is
are we actually solving the problem
so when I when I see Microsoft say
something like we are committed to you
know we're still committed to to Dei I'm
with you I don't believe them I will say
though I think Tech is having a moment
and and candidly in our country right
now is having a moment is if we are
trying to solve this problem too
late so my take here is actually we need
to solve this problem much much earlier
in someone's life and when I was at
Google uh we were building a data center
in uh Monks Corner uh South Carolina and
it's like an hour outside of Charleston
it's like it's like way in the sticks or
at least was 10 years ago when we were
doing this
and as part of putting the data center
there Google wanted to help kids uh
become native in software engineering
and so we hired like 30 teachers
and we deployed those teachers with
their own curriculum across multiple
schools for seventh and eighth
graders that for me is something that
actually will not affect Google's
diversity report next year or the year
after or the year after that but that
for me actually feels like the right
level of work to do given that it's at
the community level and given that it's
at the level to where we can help these
kids much much earlier than trying to
reverse engineer things towards the end
of a hiring process right it is logical
and I I do agree that the things that
have been in place have not been
effective as as we would like however
and you've seen this and I I just
haven't in these articles with all these
companies cutting it now I don't see
anything in its place of here's why
we're we're doing this and here's how
we're changing our approach
like that's what the frustrating thing
for me is is it's it feels like just a
cutting versus I totally agree we're
we're we're cutting this to replace it
with this or try this
or that that's what's missing for me
and I just think you know I think Tech's
had a long history of of companies kind
of copying each other and doing this and
I just feel like we've we've swung it
back and we're seeing these folks do
this and I I want to see what it's
replaced with I just not not read any of
that yeah it's a good point I mean I
think in in Microsoft's case like they
have committed something along the order
of like $150 million annually to to
diversity topics now how they deployed
that and what are those programs and
where do they show up like no one
actually knows right like they they're
not telling us they're just giving us
this number um but I'm I'm I'm actually
I think it's a really good point Kelly
I'm with you I feel
like we've been lied too especially by
big big Tech like Google Microsoft meta
they've all said that this is incredibly
important to them and now we're seeing
them cut the teams that were owning
these
initiatives and we're not and and the
only thing we're seeing out of them is
like here's our Dei report you know
which we just put out every year it's
kind of like oh here it is here it is
again another year another year of like
no changes yeah yeah what are they doing
like do because you could say that you
really care but your actions is what
actually matters and I'm with you I
think you're exactly right that these
actions feel
 
hypocritical right and and I it's also
it's also makes me sad because there
were good things that have been done
like to just throw all this out and say
it wasn't helpful at all I think is a
little a little naive uh and and talk
talk talk more tell me more about what
what do you because I I tend to agree I
I think intent was certainly good but
like what do you think actually
worked I I do think there are soft
tissue type of
improvements in how
companies got better right as far as how
they interacted with people the
inclusion the no the no tolerance on
folks not treating folks with respect
like I do think if you look at you know
I'm I'm used to in 2013 2014 kind of the
rise of this this bro culture in San
Francisco and all these companies that
actually did really terrible things and
and acted bad behavior right I think a
lot of that was turned and had
spotlights on it through de programs or
articles or again and I was involved in
some of them so I I do think that if I
compare 2014 to
 
to speak as far as the behaviors the
ethos kind of the the vibe in these
companies and I think that's a really
good thing and I don't I don't want to
lose sight of that because we don't see
numbers changing enough right if if
those things hadn't happened in the last
 
think we we'd see a lot different type
of type companies now and I just don't
want that to see back because of this I
just don't want these headline that I
don't think tell the whole story of De
being cut to give people
permission right to regress back into
behaviors and Vibes that are just
frankly unacceptable so yeah what I'm
hopeful for that's been kind of sad and
Ne what I'm hopeful for is that we are
you know kind of turning from chapter
one to chapter two so to speak and the
page is like
midt I just I want I I'm hopeful for
more companies now to Define what
chapter 2 looks like in Creative
different ways continue the good stuff
but but show us what it what it could
look like as far as as far as
differently and perhaps there are no Dei
departments I'm not advocating that they
need to be there but what I'm missing is
the Next Generation the better way of
doing this within dnas of companies and
those companies not just saying oh
everyone's throwing it out it's not
business critical we're not paying
attention to it that's my fear you're
totally right hey everyone we'll be
right back in a moment after a word from
our sponsors Real Talk most Talent
leaders haven't yet cracked how to
leverage AI for Meaningful impact on
their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting team's efficiency and quality
use metaview metaview is the AI
assistance for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
candidates during calls and save time on
the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline hiring teams
can make confident informed decisions
and talent leaders can finally take
control of the interview process join
Forward Thinking Talent leaders at high
performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and quora and check out
medavie head over to metav vi. a/h
Heretics to talk to one of meds product
experts or get started for free you'll
be UPR running an AI enabled in
minutes I've said this on the Pod before
but when I was eight or nine years old I
got chickenpox and got sent home from
school my mom was a paralal and she
decided to stay home with me and she was
terminated for making that decision
literally after staying one day with
with me at home and not going to
work that does still happen but the
amount at which it happens is so much
less than what we experienced 20 30
years ago and historians yes have said
this many times that if we you know it
always feels if you're just looking
right now in living where your two feet
are it always feels like things are very
tumultuous and things are crazy but if
you actually reflect on where we are in
history it's never been as good as it is
today that's just what historians say so
I think you're you're totally right yeah
that we have made significant progress
specifically with how we interact with
each other and how inclusive cultures
have become especially with differing
viewpoints um and you know different
backgrounds and different races and
different genders and different
socioeconomic
statuses uh but you're right it's not
done and you know our friend of the Pod
David hanahand said this it's like it's
never going to be done there's never a
Finish Line the question is is how does
this work how does this work continue as
part of chapter two I I love the way
you're thinking about it and I don't
think it's acceptable for these big tech
companies who have made these promises
over the course of the last five to 10
years to be like sorry we're just
cutting the team and we don't have an
answer for you we should hold them more
accountable um my take is if I was them
and if I was you know leading a people
team right now inside of a tech company
my take would be we're integrating this
work into everything that we do what
really matters to us is inclusion what
really matters to us is hearing
different viewpoints of creating an idea
meritocracy of ensuring that there is no
discrimination inside of our Workforce
and I think that's what we're going to
see but the silence on what happens
next is unacceptable from these big tech
companies because we looked to them as
the everyone models after their behavior
yeah right and and I've said this for
you know my 24 years in in Tech we have
the most one could argue the most
resources the most money the most power
to push the envelope and lead the way
for for others that need to be better so
if we pull back from that who's going to
do it freaking Banks aren't going to do
it so like that's right that that's
that's why I'm pushing this because if
if if we get lazy and fall back it's
going to give it's going to put everyone
out like you know what I mean we're
we're leading the way and we're raising
the bar and we're forcing others to do
this and to your point about the story
about your mom like I think that is some
of the biggest biggest examples of the
progress we've made it's not in the
numbers or the quotas or the percentages
it's in these stories and the these
again these qualitative atmospheric
experiences that I I think should be
more of chapter 2 um because that leads
to the percentages right you get more of
these stories all of a sudden all these
women want to work at this company and
then the percentages follow so I I think
there's something along the lines of
like the qualitative environmental kind
of Behavioral thing around this uh for
chapter two and we've just LED with got
to move the numbers got to have an
affinity group and now we're diverse
it's like doesn't it's just silly um I
agree the numbers and the numbers
haven't moved and and so you know I I do
think it we're it's it's time to try
something new and look we're going to
continue this conversation here we've
been having these uncomfortable
conversations now for months and you
know what's interesting for me Kelly
last
point the conversations are getting less
uncomfortable like I think we're
actually like sunlight is the best
disinfectant like we're having the right
discussion we're no longer you know
feeling the pressure of being silenced
and so I'm excited to see what comes
next and I think it's an opportunity for
many of our listeners who who are
operating inside of companies for sure
