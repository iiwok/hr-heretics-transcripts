differences um in those generations noan
with this cut on the overall cut but it
 
with this cut on the overall cut but it
is and I think it's nice not nice to see
 
is and I think it's nice not nice to see
this but it's nice to see that the
 
this but it's nice to see that the
anecdotal things we've been talking
 
anecdotal things we've been talking
about are actually verified with this
 
about are actually verified with this
huge data set of what's been happening
 
huge data set of what's been happening
yep so what's interesting to me is you
 
yep so what's interesting to me is you
know we went from the great
 
know we went from the great
resignation to to then obviously every
 
resignation to to then obviously every
every company had some you know for form
 
every company had some you know for form
of a riff or layoff to now where you
 
of a riff or layoff to now where you
know people are calling it the the big
 
know people are calling it the the big
stay right to where employees aren't
 
stay right to where employees aren't
leaving because there aren't many jobs
 
leaving because there aren't many jobs
open now we see this data and what's
 
open now we see this data and what's
interesting to me about this data is uh
 
interesting to me about this data is uh
you know you could have expected if you
 
you know you could have expected if you
were in uh you know call it like a level
 
were in uh you know call it like a level
three to four five role for the last few
 
three to four five role for the last few
years in Tech every 18 to 36 months you
 
years in Tech every 18 to 36 months you
can expect a promotion
 
can expect a promotion
now what we're seeing in this data is is
 
now what we're seeing in this data is is
like that's not happening promotions are
 
like that's not happening promotions are
going away and I think the reason why is
 
going away and I think the reason why is
actually something that I learned at
 
actually something that I learned at
Google is like well you can't just get
 
Google is like well you can't just get
promoted for for doing great work you
 
promoted for for doing great work you
can only get promoted if the next job is
 
can only get promoted if the next job is
big enough for you to take that on and I
 
big enough for you to take that on and I
think what this data is actually showing
 
think what this data is actually showing
is is actually like there isn't that
 
is is actually like there isn't that
next job
 
next job
available and so the question becomes
 
available and so the question becomes
yeah what happens what happens with
 
yeah what happens what happens with
these employees are they going to
 
these employees are they going to
continue to stay in these roles are
 
continue to stay in these roles are
employers going to to start giving
 
employers going to to start giving
salary increases at a more uh
 
salary increases at a more uh
accelerated rate because they can't
 
accelerated rate because they can't
promote these people into new titles
 
promote these people into new titles

increases without promotion costs money
 
increases without promotion costs money
which is the thing that everyone what
 
which is the thing that everyone what
was losing so I think I think that

played a very big factor in it and then
 
played a very big factor in it and then
look at what we did we did it here like
 
look at what we did we did it here like
you simplify the organization you're
 
you simplify the organization you're
cutting jobs you're flattening the
 
cutting jobs you're flattening the
structures you're reducing s you're
 
structures you're reducing s you're
increasing spans and you're shifting
 
increasing spans and you're shifting
your whole company construction as we've
 
your whole company construction as we've
been talking about to doers and less
 
been talking about to doers and less
topheavy right and then you're having I
 
topheavy right and then you're having I
don't know about you all out there but
 
don't know about you all out there but
you're having these early stage kind of
 
you're having these early stage kind of
entry level roles lesson because that's
 
entry level roles lesson because that's
a lot of the promotions right what
 
a lot of the promotions right what
should be we see fast cycles of sdrs
 
should be we see fast cycles of sdrs
csms of entry level AES these are the
 
csms of entry level AES these are the
roles that you get from really quickly
 
roles that you get from really quickly
why of those rules got freaking cut and
 
why of those rules got freaking cut and
so I think it it never is one thing in
 
so I think it it never is one thing in
life as we know but I think it's
 
life as we know but I think it's
multiple things that all contributed to
 
multiple things that all contributed to
this lagging indicator bar chart of a
 
this lagging indicator bar chart of a
few months ago and that's all the stuff
 
few months ago and that's all the stuff
that happened the last 18 months showing
 
that happened the last 18 months showing
up in that bar chart yep I I think
 
up in that bar chart yep I I think
what's going to happen
 
what's going to happen
is a growing
 
is a growing
dissatisfaction amongst employees we've
 
dissatisfaction amongst employees we've
already seen this over the the course of
 
already seen this over the the course of
the last few years but now if you're if
 
the last few years but now if you're if
you're telling somebody hey you know we
 
you're telling somebody hey you know we
need you to do this job and there is no
 
need you to do this job and there is no
career path for you here we just expect
 
career path for you here we just expect
you to do this job and be happy about
 
you to do this job and be happy about
doing that job because there may not be
 
doing that job because there may not be
another job for you in the
 
another job for you in the
market that person is going to start to
 
market that person is going to start to
think about their backup
 
think about their backup
plan and it may be true I I still think
 
plan and it may be true I I still think
it's true today in general in Tech that
 
it's true today in general in Tech that
uh jobs are disappearing faster than
 
uh jobs are disappearing faster than
they're appearing I know that that's a
 
they're appearing I know that that's a
pessimistic take I like to be an
 
pessimistic take I like to be an
optimistic person but I I aspire to be a
 
optimistic person but I I aspire to be a
realistic person first I think AI is
 
realistic person first I think AI is
going to take away especially more of
 
going to take away especially more of
those new entry level jobs which is what
 
those new entry level jobs which is what
you're talking about that already
 
you're talking about that already
started going away during the last
 
started going away during the last
couple of years I think AI is going to
 
couple of years I think AI is going to
to take more of those away and so if you
 
to take more of those away and so if you
start to think about I'm in this role
 
start to think about I'm in this role
I've been here for a few years and I'm
 
I've been here for a few years and I'm
not seeing career progression
 
not seeing career progression
what do I start doing I start thinking
 
what do I start doing I start thinking
about other revenue streams for myself
 
about other revenue streams for myself
that is not this job I start giving less
 
that is not this job I start giving less
to my job and start thinking more about
 
to my job and start thinking more about
like what's what's my backup plan here
 
like what's what's my backup plan here
in case they do cut me because they've
 
in case they do cut me because they've
already done two
 
already done two
layoffs and so I think that's what's
 
layoffs and so I think that's what's
going to to start to happen if not
 
going to to start to happen if not
already happening like everyone's going
 
already happening like everyone's going

I think they're coming from a
perspective of well you know you should
 
perspective of well you know you should
be happy that you should have a job and
