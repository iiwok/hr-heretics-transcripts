what's up everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we're doing a segment on
promotions and so I'm gonna pop up my
screen right now and for those of you
listening I'll walk you through what I'm
going to share with the audience that's
going to watch so basically this data is
from live data
Technologies and they are showing data
as I pop it up right
now uh about
promotions and it turns out that in q1
promotions q1 of 2024 promotions are
down
 
of 2022 to q1 of 2024 it looks like
they're down almost half so Kelly we've
had a couple of conversations and I
would say like anec doal feedback from
friends and peers talking about now
what's actually showing up in the data
uh by the way this is a sample of 68
million us-based White Collar
professionals so that's what the data
set is so Kelly what's your take on this
promotion data and what do you think is
going on
here yeah know hi everyone it's nice to
be back from the beach I was not having
a p the record my ti my ties sorry nor
was at the beach this is yeah this is
great because I told Nolan right we've
been talking about this across a few
episodes this that but but you're right
it has been in do and now we're looking
at right six bars here six years of data
and this last quarter it was it was half
uh of what it was two years ago and kind
of impacted all the groups
proportionately the same so if you look
at Boomers Gen X Millennials and gen Z
I'm not seen a lot of significant
differences um in those generations noan
with this cut on the overall cut but it
is and I think it's nice not nice to see
this but it's nice to see that the
anecdotal things we've been talking
about are actually verified with this
huge data set of what's been happening
yep so what's interesting to me is you
know we went from the great
resignation to to then obviously every
every company had some you know for form
of a riff or layoff to now where you
know people are calling it the the big
stay right to where employees aren't
leaving because there aren't many jobs
open now we see this data and what's
interesting to me about this data is uh
you know you could have expected if you
were in uh you know call it like a level
three to four five role for the last few
years in Tech every 18 to 36 months you
can expect a promotion
now what we're seeing in this data is is
like that's not happening promotions are
going away and I think the reason why is
actually something that I learned at
Google is like well you can't just get
promoted for for doing great work you
can only get promoted if the next job is
big enough for you to take that on and I
think what this data is actually showing
is is actually like there isn't that
next job
available and so the question becomes
yeah what happens what happens with
these employees are they going to
continue to stay in these roles are
employers going to to start giving
salary increases at a more uh
accelerated rate because they can't
promote these people into new titles
what do you think's gon to happen here
Kelly look I mean I I think this this
shouldn't this hasn't been surprising to
me and let me just take you through my
my Logic on that so 18 months ago or
whatnot you know what I mean like stuff
hit the fan and companies basically like
like just drained it in sending hiring
everyone did a RIS I don't even know I
mean if anyone did not do RIS I applaud
you we did two not huge BS but we did
two of them when you're doing these
things it's very hard to reconcile
spending a bunch of money on promotions
marit a lot of companies didn't even do
cop increases correct they didn't do
Merit Cycles because they were trying to
survive as organization either the cash
or they're trying to keep jobs right and
and promoting people let alone giving
increases without promotion costs money
which is the thing that everyone what
was losing so I think I think that
played a very big factor in it and then
look at what we did we did it here like
you simplify the organization you're
cutting jobs you're flattening the
structures you're reducing s you're
increasing spans and you're shifting
your whole company construction as we've
been talking about to doers and less
topheavy right and then you're having I
don't know about you all out there but
you're having these early stage kind of
entry level roles lesson because that's
a lot of the promotions right what
should be we see fast cycles of sdrs
csms of entry level AES these are the
roles that you get from really quickly
why of those rules got freaking cut and
so I think it it never is one thing in
life as we know but I think it's
multiple things that all contributed to
this lagging indicator bar chart of a
few months ago and that's all the stuff
that happened the last 18 months showing
up in that bar chart yep I I think
what's going to happen
is a growing
dissatisfaction amongst employees we've
already seen this over the the course of
the last few years but now if you're if
you're telling somebody hey you know we
need you to do this job and there is no
career path for you here we just expect
you to do this job and be happy about
doing that job because there may not be
another job for you in the
market that person is going to start to
think about their backup
plan and it may be true I I still think
it's true today in general in Tech that
uh jobs are disappearing faster than
they're appearing I know that that's a
pessimistic take I like to be an
optimistic person but I I aspire to be a
realistic person first I think AI is
going to take away especially more of
those new entry level jobs which is what
you're talking about that already
started going away during the last
couple of years I think AI is going to
to take more of those away and so if you
start to think about I'm in this role
I've been here for a few years and I'm
not seeing career progression
what do I start doing I start thinking
about other revenue streams for myself
that is not this job I start giving less
to my job and start thinking more about
like what's what's my backup plan here
in case they do cut me because they've
already done two
layoffs and so I think that's what's
going to to start to happen if not
already happening like everyone's going
to have a sidekick and a side hustle
eventually uh and I'm curious how
companies are going to think about that
because
I think they're coming from a
perspective of well you know you should
be happy that you should have a job and
I I just I just see this uh this this
train wreck coming in the near future if
more roles and more responsibility don't
become open to employees to grow
themselves and grow their

an AI enabled in
minutes so yeah there's a few threads
there I mean the AI thing I'd love to
maybe pin that because I don't think
that AI has been the reason you saw a
lot of these lower level roles get cut I
personally think a is going to take a
while for folks to fure it out I think
everyone's loves saying it I think no
one's really figured out how to
operationalize it so you can cut these
organizations in half and I'll tell you
like we cut csms and basically nothing
no one was there to catch the war not
another person not Ai and we be hurt
because of that so my hypothesis is that
AI is still going slow for many people
again we all love to say it I think very
few have wrapped their heads around
enough to replace jobs like that will
come but I don't think that that was a
factor in in this the last 18 months
now you know you know my take that we're
we're humans humans are right we have
bias we do this we we go left we go
right we follow where the wind blow I
think the pendulum has swung so far
right let's just say it was so far one
way three years ago where people were
like throwing money at folks people were
holding company's hostage if you don't
promote me I'm leaving they get promoted
I mean look at the bar chart right it's
it's fight like two two and a half years
ago and then everything kind of clamped
down companies swung way the other way
and I've heard it I heard it from a few
right they kind of took advantage of it
to say you know what we're taking our
power back
you the grass isn't Greener anywhere
because everyone's hurting and we're
going to clamp down on this and then
people got stuck in the O moments
that I think is happening now and you're
seeing a lot of companies saying oh but
for great people that we want to stay
here and are amazing at what they do we
actually forgot that we have to like
show that we love them and retain them
so I'm seeing a lot of these like
retention popup tents right coming up
special Equity like I've seen a lot of
these things come up because in true
form everyone kind of sees what's right
in front of their face and that was the
macro and forgot that oh for the the
special 5 10% you do actually have to
pay attention to these people the last
thing I'll say is I don't know about all
of you out there but I am seeing and
feeling it I'm right here San Francisco
the bay area and I'm moving out of my
full-time role at pendo to an advisor
role which I'm really excited about
which means I've been out in the market
more reconnecting with folks chatting
with VCS chatting with old colleagues
the soil is loosening out there like
it's not going you know in the the
greatest Direction and very fast but it
doesn't feel like it felt a year ago and
there's a lot more movement roles um
even if the roles aren't open companies
are talking about how they're going to
reorganize and have different
opportunities like it's like the Titanic
engine is starting and the other
direction albeit slowly and I think that
com a year 18 months from now noan
people are not going to be able to say
anymore the grass isn't Greener anywhere
else H yeah you know I so I agree with
what you're saying as it relates to
early stage
companies I don't agree at the growth
stage and I think the growth stage has
been such a driver of hiring in our
ecosystem
that if you just look at that data right
you you know promotions at like a series
a series B company aren't like really a
thing like for sure they happen but it's
just like usually like you just like
take on more is like what a
promotion you're yeah yeah yeah but
you're not getting like an increase
until like you know nine months later
and like when you know somebody forgot
that you actually like did all these
things but I think the growth phase of
these the growth stage rather of these
companies has been such a driver of
hiring in our ecosystem and I'm just not
sure that that's going to ever look like
it did five to 10 years ago it might I
hope it does but you and I have been
saying on this podcast that company
formation is changing you just describe
changes that you guys made at pendo you
flatten the org you have more ic's you
have less
managers all of that to me means we are
leaner we are optimized for more doers
and we are just going to run in this new
way to where we need less people and so
I think an expectation change is on the
horizon for employees like this is where
uh this is where my take
is what we saw for the last 10 years is
not what we're going to see for the next
 
pattern of what happened in the past to
think about what's going to happen in
the future and so this is where you and
I have talked about laying on you know
being a layoff proof building your
networks building your skill sets those
are the things that are going to go to
the five to 10% I think you said it
really well Kelly and it was kind of
like a little bit of like a asterisk but
I think it's the thing if you are in
that top five to 10 Perc things are
going to be awesome for you probably
better than ever before if you are not
in that category or you're not thought
of in that category I think it's going
to be very challenging moving forward
yeah the other thing that I'll say is
these this let's call it this this like
herd of grow companies right that are
all in this spot can't go public can't
raise High
valuation yes that is me thr a rock
they're all over the place I don't think
that will be the case a year from now I
think that these companies fast forward
 
or survive and so I do think that you
will see like a group within that
consideration set high growth again and
come out of this and I know I think that
company construction will will will be
different and this will always be in the
bad people's bins but I also know when
like the ball starts rolling and money's
coming in you got products your customer
that's a that's a big fever of like we
gotta hire we got to grow and so I do
think that that will come back but it's
not going to be nine out of 10 companies
anymore right it'll may be five 10 yep
yep well said so my my advice to the
audience is is plan for the worst hope
for the best like be an optimist I am an
optimist I know I sound pessimistic on
these last couple shows I don't want to
be that way I just want to be real with
what I'm hearing from my friends so uh
let us know what you guys think let us
know what you're hearing you know from
your from inside of your companies Kelly
and I will obviously like keep this
stuff confidential but it's it's good
for us to keep an ear to the ground and
we want to hear from the audience so let
us know what you what you think uh our
DMS are open on LinkedIn and on Twitter
uh and as always hit us up in the
comments if you have any questions or
thoughts thanks everybody thanks all HR
