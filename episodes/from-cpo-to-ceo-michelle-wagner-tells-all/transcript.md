you've got to work with it yeah and
 
you've got to work with it yeah and
that's the reality you know I think the
 
that's the reality you know I think the
take is from from uh spe specifically
 
take is from from uh spe specifically
like the board who would be hiring you
 
like the board who would be hiring you
is you know those are just like the the
 
is you know those are just like the the
you know you said it earlier right every
 
you know you said it earlier right every
company's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show and that's like
 
company's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show and that's like
that's like the the underneath the
 
that's like the the underneath the
surface of that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show of the

company at the end of the day they think
 
company at the end of the day they think
I'm not saying this is true but I think
 
I'm not saying this is true but I think
they think
 
they think
it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter what matters
 
it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter what matters
is do we have an amazing go to market
 
is do we have an amazing go to market
motion do we have an amazing product and

do we have you know customers that are
 
do we have you know customers that are
obsessed with our product and all the
 
obsessed with our product and all the
other stuff they're like ah we'll figure
 
other stuff they're like ah we'll figure
it out you know and I think that's the
 
it out you know and I think that's the
general take of the board when they're
 
general take of the board when they're
hiring is they're not optimized for a
 
hiring is they're not optimized for a
company that's running smoothly they're
 
company that's running smoothly they're
optimized for revenue and products that

things agree with you Nolan because when
a company's doing well it doesn't matter
 
a company's doing well it doesn't matter
how much of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show it is exactly it
 
how much of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show it is exactly it
just doesn't matter and if a company's
 
just doesn't matter and if a company's
not doing well it suddenly matters but
 
not doing well it suddenly matters but
my take would be imagine that company
 
my take would be imagine that company
that's doing well and wasn't running
 
that's doing well and wasn't running
like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show I bet it would sustain
 
like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show I bet it would sustain
