Yeah, you know, first and foremost, you
 
Yeah, you know, first and foremost, you
have to start from the point of view
 
have to start from the point of view
that you are in you are as much in the
 
that you are in you are as much in the
driver's seat as the recruiter, the
 
driver's seat as the recruiter, the
company who's recruiting you, etc.
 
company who's recruiting you, etc.
You've got to feel like a peer and
 
You've got to feel like a peer and
that's hard particularly for individuals
 
that's hard particularly for individuals
that maybe have imposttor syndrome, but
 
that maybe have imposttor syndrome, but
even those of us who don't necessarily
 
even those of us who don't necessarily
can feel that can feel daunting. So,
 
can feel that can feel daunting. So,
know you're in the driver's seat, too.
 
know you're in the driver's seat, too.
Our clients to build strong assessment
 
Our clients to build strong assessment

things that you as a candidate want to
 
things that you as a candidate want to
do with the company, with the

individuals.
 
individuals.
The other you know key point that I that
 
The other you know key point that I that
again has been really exciting over the
 
again has been really exciting over the
last call it 12 18 months is the fact
 
last call it 12 18 months is the fact
that even when in areas that maybe I
 
that even when in areas that maybe I
didn't have the highest confidence level
 
didn't have the highest confidence level
in call it deep financial statement
 
in call it deep financial statement
analysis or understanding you know
 
analysis or understanding you know
revenue and margin I now have the
 
revenue and margin I now have the
confidence of the GPTs of chat GPT of
 
confidence of the GPTs of chat GPT of
claude whoever you use to be able to
 
claude whoever you use to be able to
prep myself to know what good answers
 
prep myself to know what good answers
are in some of those areas or to
 
are in some of those areas or to
increase my confidence in being able to
 
increase my confidence in being able to
ask those questions because sometimes I
 
ask those questions because sometimes I
didn't ask those questions initially in
 
didn't ask those questions initially in
my first couple searches because I was
 
my first couple searches because I was
worried about like not knowing the right
 
worried about like not knowing the right
answer or them asking a question of me
 
answer or them asking a question of me
that I didn't know the answer to like
 
that I didn't know the answer to like
you know I don't want to poke and prod
 
you know I don't want to poke and prod
around that area if I don't if I don't
 
around that area if I don't if I don't
know enough about it. So there's been
 
know enough about it. So there's been
some really cool developments that it
 
some really cool developments that it
can increase that confidence to be more
 
can increase that confidence to be more
in the driver's seat. Yeah. I mean, like
 
in the driver's seat. Yeah. I mean, like
what I would also say too is that it
 
what I would also say too is that it
turns out no human is perfect. Correct.
 
turns out no human is perfect. Correct.
Right. And so I actually kind of do the
 
Right. And so I actually kind of do the
opposite, which is I'm super candid and
 
opposite, which is I'm super candid and
transparent on what I know and what I
 
transparent on what I know and what I
don't know. And when I don't know
 
don't know. And when I don't know
something, I also go through the process
 
something, I also go through the process
of like how I figured that thing
 
of like how I figured that thing
out versus my dad used to say this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
out versus my dad used to say this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
when I was a kid. He'd be like, "Oh,
 
when I was a kid. He'd be like, "Oh,
son, you got to fake it until you make
 
son, you got to fake it until you make
it." Totally. which I think is the worst
 
it." Totally. which I think is the worst
advice because we we lie. We're like
 
advice because we we lie. We're like
it's like a it's like a dry and then
 
it's like a it's like a dry and then
you're living a lie when you act like
 
you're living a lie when you act like
that person. Yeah. Well, and I'll tell
 
that person. Yeah. Well, and I'll tell
you, I've been not selected for reasons
 
you, I've been not selected for reasons
of potentially always having an answer.
 
of potentially always having an answer.
So, I learned that in a couple of
 
So, I learned that in a couple of
searches and you know, I learned that at
 
searches and you know, I learned that at
Accenture, right? You're a management
 
Accenture, right? You're a management
consultant. You're supposed to have
 
consultant. You're supposed to have
quote unquote all the answers. And so I
 
quote unquote all the answers. And so I
that was ingrained in me 10 years at a
 
that was ingrained in me 10 years at a
place like that. You know, things get
 
place like that. You know, things get
ingrained in you. And you know, the the
 
ingrained in you. And you know, the the
other thing you mentioned is like
 
other thing you mentioned is like
letting the recruiter or CEO like drive
 
letting the recruiter or CEO like drive
the process versus like you also
 
the process versus like you also
driving. I have found with friends that
 
driving. I have found with friends that
it is very easy to get kind of pulled in
 
it is very easy to get kind of pulled in
and like sucked into the vortex of
 
and like sucked into the vortex of
what's like the opportunity in front of
 
what's like the opportunity in front of
you. And taking like a step back is
 
you. And taking like a step back is
actually really hard because like first
 
actually really hard because like first
of all when you're exec there's not that
 
of all when you're exec there's not that
many of these opportunities just by
 
many of these opportunities just by
definition there's like you know five to
 
definition there's like you know five to
eight executives at every company right
 
eight executives at every company right
and so there's fewer of these roles and
 
and so there's fewer of these roles and
so when they come along then the other
 
so when they come along then the other
piece is you're like dealing with like
 
piece is you're like dealing with like
some really typically very good
 
some really typically very good
communicators like exec recruiters are
 
communicators like exec recruiters are
very good communicators they're very
 
very good communicators they're very
good salespeople so are typically CEOs
 
good salespeople so are typically CEOs
who the person you're going to be
 
who the person you're going to be
reporting to And so how do like what's
 
reporting to And so how do like what's
your process been to just figure out
 
your process been to just figure out
like internally what matters for you and
 
like internally what matters for you and
then how do you go and apply that filter
 
then how do you go and apply that filter
when you're talking to companies?
 
when you're talking to companies?
Yeah. And I liken this to like
 
Yeah. And I liken this to like
matchmaking. Like I think that it it
 
matchmaking. Like I think that it it
does you know there are t there are some
 
does you know there are t there are some
very similar feelings to dating and
 
very similar feelings to dating and
relationships where you can feel a lot
 
relationships where you can feel a lot
of pressure and you can feel a lot of
 
of pressure and you can feel a lot of
fear about not being picked. And
 
fear about not being picked. And
sometimes our behaviors can reflect that
 
sometimes our behaviors can reflect that
in more of a reality than what we
 
in more of a reality than what we
probably would want if we were looking
 
probably would want if we were looking
at it from the outside. So, you know, I
 
at it from the outside. So, you know, I
think first and foremost, it's about
 
think first and foremost, it's about
getting prepared ahead of time, thinking
 
getting prepared ahead of time, thinking
about what that criteria is, thinking
 
about what that criteria is, thinking
about who you want to talk to, what is
 
about who you want to talk to, what is
important to you, what what are
 
important to you, what what are
non-negotiables. Again, all these things
 
non-negotiables. Again, all these things
could be used for lots of different
 
could be used for lots of different
scenarios, but when you think about
 
scenarios, but when you think about
non-negotiables, whether it's, you know,
 
non-negotiables, whether it's, you know,
the approach to the workforce strategy,
 
the approach to the workforce strategy,
remote versus in office, when you think
 
remote versus in office, when you think
about potentially things even like
 
about potentially things even like
positioning for compensation, what you
 
positioning for compensation, what you
know, what the CEO's philosophy is on on
 
know, what the CEO's philosophy is on on
where they want to pay people, the mix
 
where they want to pay people, the mix
of equity and cash, right? There are a
 
of equity and cash, right? There are a
lot of these decisions, these
 
lot of these decisions, these
philosophical decisions that if we don't
 
philosophical decisions that if we don't
present them and make them a part of
 
present them and make them a part of
potentially our criteria, we get
 
potentially our criteria, we get
selected for the role and you know 6 12
 
selected for the role and you know 6 12
months in we're at a really high
 
months in we're at a really high
conflict point and we're not aligned.
 
conflict point and we're not aligned.
Yeah. LJ Brock said that when he was on
 
Yeah. LJ Brock said that when he was on
the show, which was like, you actually
 
the show, which was like, you actually
don't know. There's so many things we
 
don't know. There's so many things we
don't know about the other side, right?
 
don't know about the other side, right?
Whether we're in the company or we're
 
Whether we're in the company or we're
the executive until you actually go
 
the executive until you actually go
through that high conflict point. And
 
through that high conflict point. And
then that's when a lot of things become
 
then that's when a lot of things become
illuminating. But to your point on the
 
illuminating. But to your point on the
non-negotiables, like I think a lot of
 
non-negotiables, like I think a lot of
things people don't talk about, is this
 
things people don't talk about, is this
product even something I'm excited
 
product even something I'm excited
about? Right. like something super basic
 
about? Right. like something super basic
as just do I really want to go sell this
 
as just do I really want to go sell this
thing for the next 5 years because it's
 
thing for the next 5 years because it's
really easy to get wrapped into like oh
 
really easy to get wrapped into like oh
I like this person or oh man they're
 
I like this person or oh man they're
selling something really good or the
 
selling something really good or the
revenue is growing really fast and you
 
revenue is growing really fast and you
start contorting yourself when you don't
 
start contorting yourself when you don't
like just take a step back and think
 
like just take a step back and think
first principles of like what matters
 
first principles of like what matters
for me and it's crazy that people don't
 
for me and it's crazy that people don't
do that but I feel like it's like you've
 
do that but I feel like it's like you've
got to start there period if you're an
 
got to start there period if you're an
exec I agree yeah I kind of think about
 
exec I agree yeah I kind of think about
it in in a framework of the business,
 
it in in a framework of the business,
the product or services and then the
 
the product or services and then the
work that we are probably going to do
 
work that we are probably going to do
together as an HR executive and the
 
together as an HR executive and the
executive team and it's digging in it's
 
executive team and it's digging in it's
defining those criteria to your point
 
defining those criteria to your point
you know do I want a certain growth do I
 
you know do I want a certain growth do I
want a certain margin do I and by the
 
want a certain margin do I and by the
way a lot of that wasn't you know
 
way a lot of that wasn't you know
decided by us and again it's also where
 
decided by us and again it's also where
I took a very different position after
 
I took a very different position after
one of the organizations that I work for
 
one of the organizations that I work for
you know was burning cash crazy like
 
you know was burning cash crazy like
everybody was. I made a very thoughtful
 
everybody was. I made a very thoughtful
move to the next company that I wanted
 
move to the next company that I wanted
to ensure they were thinking about andor
 
to ensure they were thinking about andor
creating they not only had started to
 
creating they not only had started to
achieve this but they had a plan to
 
achieve this but they had a plan to
continue being profitable and delivering
 
continue being profitable and delivering
profit and delivering margins and then
 
profit and delivering margins and then
from the product perspective absolutely
 
from the product perspective absolutely
I try to be if I can't be a user of that
 
I try to be if I can't be a user of that
system and love it or the product then I
 
system and love it or the product then I
at least need to understand the use
 
at least need to understand the use
cases you need to understand the
 
cases you need to understand the
customer value proposition and
 
customer value proposition and
understand what the satisfaction is of
 
understand what the satisfaction is of
the product. Totally. And you'd
 
the product. Totally. And you'd
mentioned something kind of in passing
 
mentioned something kind of in passing
at the beginning which is around getting
 
at the beginning which is around getting
picked and that analogy holding true for
 
picked and that analogy holding true for
like
 
like
matchmaking. I feel
 
matchmaking. I feel
like most execs who are
 
like most execs who are
talented actually don't realize how
 
talented actually don't realize how
talented they are. Mhm. Mhm. And so part
 
talented they are. Mhm. Mhm. And so part
of it is like you don't see that many of
 
of it is like you don't see that many of
these opportunities when an opportunity
 
these opportunities when an opportunity
comes up, right? You're trying not to
 
comes up, right? You're trying not to
lose
 
lose
it as opposed to trying to figure out is
 
it as opposed to trying to figure out is
this does this opportunity meet my
 
this does this opportunity meet my
criteria of what I'm optimizing for.
 
criteria of what I'm optimizing for.
Yep. And said another way, you know,
 
Yep. And said another way, you know,
don't mistake polish for fit. To your
 
don't mistake polish for fit. To your
point about these being great
 
point about these being great
communicators, they probably been doing
 
communicators, they probably been doing
this for a lot of people. Don't don't
 
this for a lot of people. Don't don't
mistake, oh wow, this is the best set of
 
mistake, oh wow, this is the best set of
conversations I've had. This is the
 
conversations I've had. This is the
cleanest. This is the most whatever
 
cleanest. This is the most whatever
polish means for you. You know, don't
 
polish means for you. You know, don't
mistake those two two things for one
 
mistake those two two things for one
another. And yeah, as you asked me
 
another. And yeah, as you asked me
before, be okay about saying no and
 
before, be okay about saying no and
explaining it. You know, I've said no to
 
explaining it. You know, I've said no to
opportunities because there wasn't a fit
 
opportunities because there wasn't a fit
on a criteria related to some of the
 
on a criteria related to some of the
strategy. I've said no to opportunities
 
strategy. I've said no to opportunities
when I heard an inconsistent story
 
when I heard an inconsistent story
between the CEO and other executives.
 
between the CEO and other executives.
I've said no to
 
I've said no to
opportunities because, you know,
 
opportunities because, you know,
ultimately the approach that they wanted
 
ultimately the approach that they wanted
to take to building out the people team
 
to take to building out the people team
didn't seem to be the long-term vision.
 
didn't seem to be the long-term vision.
It was more short-term focused. So, you
 
It was more short-term focused. So, you
know, those you have to be ready to make
 
know, those you have to be ready to make
those decisions for sure. Yeah, it's
 
those decisions for sure. Yeah, it's
really interesting. We just everybody
 
really interesting. We just everybody
wants to win, right? And this is kind of
 
wants to win, right? And this is kind of
like one of those things to where it's
 
like one of those things to where it's
actually like okay if either side says
 
actually like okay if either side says
no. That's actually a win. I always like
 
no. That's actually a win. I always like
I'm doing some exact search right now
 
I'm doing some exact search right now
and as I talk to candidates, one of the
 
and as I talk to candidates, one of the
things I say very early in the
 
things I say very early in the
conversation is I am not going to try
 
conversation is I am not going to try
and sell you at all costs. I want to get
 
and sell you at all costs. I want to get
really clear about what you're
 
really clear about what you're
optimizing for and explain everything I
 
optimizing for and explain everything I
know about this opportunity, including
 
know about this opportunity, including
all of the humans that are at play and
 
all of the humans that are at play and
like what I think their strengths are,
 
like what I think their strengths are,
where I think their areas of
 
where I think their areas of
deficiencies are, how they think about
 
deficiencies are, how they think about
style and what styles work with them,
 
style and what styles work with them,
how they think about taste and the
 
how they think about taste and the
things that like they deeply care about
 
things that like they deeply care about
and matter for them and put everything
 
and matter for them and put everything
on the table so both sides can have as
 
on the table so both sides can have as
much transparency into the other as
 
much transparency into the other as
possible such that if it does work,
 
possible such that if it does work,
awesome. But we're not going to just
 
awesome. But we're not going to just
contort ourselves to making it work
 
contort ourselves to making it work
because I think that's a recipe for a
 
because I think that's a recipe for a
car crash. Totally. And I mean, truth be
 
car crash. Totally. And I mean, truth be
told, like none of us, most of us don't
 
told, like none of us, most of us don't
want to join an organization that's
 
want to join an organization that's
running quote unquote perfectly. So when
 
running quote unquote perfectly. So when
we walk into a story where the
 
we walk into a story where the
development areas that are being
 
development areas that are being
outlined by the recruiter or the CEO,
 
outlined by the recruiter or the CEO,
you know, aren't either driving with our
 
you know, aren't either driving with our
experience or driving with the results
 
experience or driving with the results
or inconsistent across the people, you
 
or inconsistent across the people, you
know, dig in on that and and push like
 
know, dig in on that and and push like
don't take the answer again is
 
don't take the answer again is
delivered. Ask it four times. Ask it of
 
delivered. Ask it four times. Ask it of
the exec recruiter. Ask it of the CEO.
 
the exec recruiter. Ask it of the CEO.
Ask it of the individual to, you know,
 
Ask it of the individual to, you know,
to answer those questions and validate
 
to answer those questions and validate
them.
 
them.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
 
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors. I
 
moment after a word from our sponsors. I
must admit, I used to believe that AI
 
must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
 
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
 
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talent at SignalFire,
 
Doce, who leads talent at SignalFire,
told me to check out Metave. I got into
 
told me to check out Metave. I got into
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
 
the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
 
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick." Metaview is the
 
this product is sick." Metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
 
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
 
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
 
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
 
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
 
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
 
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
 
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
 
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
 
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs

So let's talk about like more
 
So let's talk about like more
specifically. So now let's take the seat
 
specifically. So now let's take the seat
of like your chief people officer,
 
of like your chief people officer,
right? I'm assuming that when CEO wants
 
right? I'm assuming that when CEO wants
to open a search like just start from
 
to open a search like just start from
the beginning of the process, they come
 
the beginning of the process, they come
to you and be like Neil, all right,
 
to you and be like Neil, all right,
we're ready to run the search like which
 
we're ready to run the search like which
firms do we partner with? And then
 
firms do we partner with? And then
you're helping pick the firm, right? And
 
you're helping pick the firm, right? And
then now we start once we pick the firm,
 
then now we start once we pick the firm,
then we kind of go into like, okay, how
 
then we kind of go into like, okay, how
are we going to assess for this person?
 
are we going to assess for this person?
What are the key things that need to
 
What are the key things that need to
know about us? So give me the rundown of
 
know about us? So give me the rundown of
how you guys think about the very
 
how you guys think about the very
beginning of an exec search. Yeah. And
 
beginning of an exec search. Yeah. And
you know again this varies between
 
you know again this varies between
internally run teams and partnering with
 
internally run teams and partnering with
the search firm. So for me you know I
 
the search firm. So for me you know I
think that there is a level
 
think that there is a level
of the story particularly as it relates

to the company and the product etc. that

that's a given for internal search teams

external firms when I'm working with you
 
external firms when I'm working with you
know there is a lot of educating them
 
know there is a lot of educating them
and ensuring that the tone and the

delivered and consistent. So I think the
trouble I've seen with some exec
 
trouble I've seen with some exec
searches has been when that story isn't

candidates start to come through that

don't meet that criteria. So it's

from start to end. I treat it just like
 
from start to end. I treat it just like
every other search. What's the criteria
 
every other search. What's the criteria
for running a search internally versus
 
for running a search internally versus
going out and using a firm? Well,
 
going out and using a firm? Well,
personally, you know, I would use an

two more after that. I've run almost,
 
two more after that. I've run almost,
you know, all my searches externally.
 
you know, all my searches externally.
So, I can answer from both sides. But if

Yeah. I like the if you were to boil it
 
Yeah. I like the if you were to boil it
down to one criteria of if you're going
 
down to one criteria of if you're going
to use an external firm, it should be
 
to use an external firm, it should be
their network. It is. It's who they
 
their network. It is. It's who they

know. It's who they can pick the phone
up, you know, again, the ones when we
 
up, you know, again, the ones when we
can and they're going to answer. Yep.
 
can and they're going to answer. Yep.
And they're going to answer and or they

that problem. When a recruiter is able
 
that problem. When a recruiter is able
to say that, when a firm is able to say
 
to say that, when a firm is able to say
that, you've probably got the right one.
 
that, you've probably got the right one.
Yeah, that's the, you know, Andy talked
 
Yeah, that's the, you know, Andy talked
about this on the show, but it's like
 
about this on the show, but it's like
the layer of depth specialty provides,
 
the layer of depth specialty provides,
right? Is like when you're running
 
right? Is like when you're running
similar searches all the time, right?
 
similar searches all the time, right?
you're typically talking to the same
 
you're typically talking to the same
people and thus you're not building the
 
people and thus you're not building the
spec on the candidate from zero. You
 
spec on the candidate from zero. You
have some level of foundation and then
 
have some level of foundation and then
you're which able which is why these
 
you're which able which is why these
search firms are able to move faster.
 
search firms are able to move faster.
Correct. Now what I layer on top of that
 
Correct. Now what I layer on top of that
is the company and the culture and you
 
is the company and the culture and you
know again this didn't happen at
 
know again this didn't happen at
Dropbox. At Alto Pharmacy, I got
 
Dropbox. At Alto Pharmacy, I got
introduced to conscious leadership, a
 
introduced to conscious leadership, a
leadership framework that has kind of a
 
leadership framework that has kind of a
set of specific behaviors. And again, by
 
set of specific behaviors. And again, by
the way, this was not something that I
 
the way, this was not something that I
got introdu in introduced to and very
 
got introdu in introduced to and very
quickly, you know, wrap my arms around
 
quickly, you know, wrap my arms around
and now it's the only ring I wear. But
 
and now it's the only ring I wear. But
to me that is not only it has served me
 
to me that is not only it has served me
as a very good set of assessment
 
as a very good set of assessment
criteria on things like taking
 
criteria on things like taking
responsibility and not blaming
 
responsibility and not blaming
others. You know setting clear
 
others. You know setting clear
agreements and renegotiating them when
 
agreements and renegotiating them when
maybe they can't be met. You know
 
maybe they can't be met. You know
feeling your
 
feeling your
feelings again in professional worlds
 
feelings again in professional worlds
where sometimes that hasn't always been
 
where sometimes that hasn't always been
allowed or encouraged. it it that
 
allowed or encouraged. it it that
differentiates not only the assessment
 
differentiates not only the assessment
process but differentiates you and your
 
process but differentiates you and your
company and your team for potentially
 
company and your team for potentially
why those candidates should be you know
 
why those candidates should be you know
coming to you and oh by the way it works
 
coming to you and oh by the way it works
the exact same way I use it to assess is
 
the exact same way I use it to assess is
this going to be a great team for me to
 
this going to be a great team for me to

Right? If you think about the things
 
Right? If you think about the things
that we as executives face and probably
 
that we as executives face and probably
lead to highest burnout, poor
 
lead to highest burnout, poor
performance, dissatisfaction. It's when
 
performance, dissatisfaction. It's when
conflict happens and nobody knows what
 
conflict happens and nobody knows what
the hell to do and you know either end
 
the hell to do and you know either end
up not solving anything or running
 
up not solving anything or running
around each other and being inefficient
 
around each other and being inefficient
in working together. So for conscious
 
in working together. So for conscious
leadership to work though I think what
 
leadership to work though I think what
needs to be true is that the CEO founder
 
needs to be true is that the CEO founder
subscribes to that type of framework and
 
subscribes to that type of framework and
philosophy. Correct. Yes.
 
philosophy. Correct. Yes.
or and again so Alto Pharmacy started at
 
or and again so Alto Pharmacy started at
the top that was the two co-founders
 
the top that was the two co-founders
really had signed up even before I got
 
really had signed up even before I got
there now fast forward to domatics you
 
there now fast forward to domatics you
know we aren't using all parts of
 
know we aren't using all parts of
conscious leadership you know we were a
 
conscious leadership you know we were a
company that was growing inorganically
 
company that was growing inorganically
we were building an HR team and c kind
 
we were building an HR team and c kind
of shared company culture together and
 
of shared company culture together and
so I was partnering with them to develop
 
so I was partnering with them to develop
values and then key behaviors and then
 
values and then key behaviors and then
performance assessments and then
 
performance assessments and then
recruiting criteria and so I've infused
 
recruiting criteria and so I've infused
pieces of conscious leadership. My CEO
 
pieces of conscious leadership. My CEO
doesn't technically subscribe to
 
doesn't technically subscribe to
conscious leadership. I talked about it
 
conscious leadership. I talked about it
with everybody as a part of the process
 
with everybody as a part of the process
and I said listen I don't think that
 
and I said listen I don't think that
this is you know this is not Lord of the
 
this is you know this is not Lord of the
Rings one ring to rule them all.
 
Rings one ring to rule them all.
However, you know I do feel strongly
 
However, you know I do feel strongly
about some of these behaviors. If the
 
about some of these behaviors. If the
behaviors resonate with you that's all
 
behaviors resonate with you that's all
that matters to me. And the same held
 
that matters to me. And the same held
true like as we built each one of those
 
true like as we built each one of those
things. We now have call it three to
 
things. We now have call it three to
four behaviors that mirror or reflect
 
four behaviors that mirror or reflect
strongly those conscious leadership but
 
strongly those conscious leadership but
we don't buy the book for everybody. We
 
we don't buy the book for everybody. We
don't drive people through a conscious
 
don't drive people through a conscious
leadership training. Do I think that can
 
leadership training. Do I think that can
be super effective? Absolutely. But I
 
be super effective? Absolutely. But I
don't think it's a I don't think it's a
 
don't think it's a I don't think it's a
non-neg or it's not required for it to
 
non-neg or it's not required for it to
be effective. Yep. the the thing you're
 
be effective. Yep. the the thing you're
like the thing we're talking about right
 
like the thing we're talking about right
now is actually
 
now is actually
style and I've been thinking a lot about
 
style and I've been thinking a lot about
this recently because I feel
 
this recently because I feel
like you know call it during the
 
like you know call it during the
 
don't I don't think it was like an
 
don't I don't think it was like an
allowed term like we weren't allowed to
 
allowed term like we weren't allowed to
have like different working styles or
 
have like different working styles or
preferred working
 
preferred working
styles because we were Like I think
 
styles because we were Like I think
unconscious bias swung a little too far.
 
unconscious bias swung a little too far.
That's one of my more contrarian takes
 
That's one of my more contrarian takes
which a lot of people disagree with me
 
which a lot of people disagree with me
on which is totally fine. But I do think
 
on which is totally fine. But I do think
through the course as companies mature
 
through the course as companies mature
they have execs that work really well
 
they have execs that work really well
and then they have execs that are
 
and then they have execs that are
absolute
 
absolute
tires. And most of the time, not always,
 
tires. And most of the time, not always,
but most of the time when somebody gets
 
but most of the time when somebody gets
to that level, they're they generally
 
to that level, they're they generally
have the technical skills for the most
 
have the technical skills for the most
part. And what's going wrong there for a
 
part. And what's going wrong there for a
tire situation is the styles are not
 
tire situation is the styles are not
compatible. How do you think about like
 
compatible. How do you think about like
figuring out the style of a company and
 
figuring out the style of a company and
then taking the style of the company and
 
then taking the style of the company and
weaving it into like the interview
 
weaving it into like the interview
process? Yeah.
 
process? Yeah.
I think
 
I think
that it's a lot of like the culture
 
that it's a lot of like the culture
work. I think I use the same framework
 
work. I think I use the same framework
that I do around
 
that I do around
culture. What are the words you would
 
describe the company? Then I try to
 
describe the company? Then I try to
break it out like what words do you
 
break it out like what words do you
describe how decisions are made? What
 
describe how decisions are made? What
words do you describe for how people
 
words do you describe for how people
manage others? what words do you
 
manage others? what words do you
describe to to
 
describe to to
describe conflict amongst peers? And so
 
describe conflict amongst peers? And so
it's based upon those words you can
 
it's based upon those words you can
start to understand more those you know
 
start to understand more those you know
that style and then you have to
 
that style and then you have to
understand there
 
understand there
are much like leadership frameworks
 
are much like leadership frameworks
there's a 100 plus assessments out
 
there's a 100 plus assessments out
there. Do you want to be basic and have
 
there. Do you want to be basic and have
four colors? Right? There's a whole
 
four colors? Right? There's a whole
bunch of style assessments with red,
 
bunch of style assessments with red,
blue, green, and yellow. And those give
 
blue, green, and yellow. And those give
you some
 
you some
information. Then there's other
 
information. Then there's other
assessments that go deeper like there's
 
assessments that go deeper like there's
insights. Insights is another example of
 
insights. Insights is another example of
an assessment and you get more of a
 
an assessment and you get more of a
rainbow dial and you're not exactly one
 
rainbow dial and you're not exactly one
color, but you're blends of colors. And
 
color, but you're blends of colors. And
then you can go to the other end of the
 
then you can go to the other end of the
spectrum with something like inagram and
 
spectrum with something like inagram and
inog you get a number that's your
 
inog you get a number that's your
primary and two wings and you can get
 
primary and two wings and you can get
real like you can get quote unquote way
 
real like you can get quote unquote way
more complicated. But those are I mean
 
more complicated. But those are I mean
to to me both starting to get you know
 
to to me both starting to get you know
an a read on what some of those words
 
an a read on what some of those words
are and therefore what some of the
 
are and therefore what some of the
behaviors and drivers
 
behaviors and drivers
are and then
 
are and then
understand what what level of complexity
 
understand what what level of complexity
slash information does the organization
 
slash information does the organization
want or need in order to support that
 
want or need in order to support that
culture or that part you know those
 
culture or that part you know those
parts of things. And during the
 
parts of things. And during the
interview process, you're probably not
 
interview process, you're probably not
going to get quite to that level, but
 
going to get quite to that level, but
you're going to get pretty close. Like,
 
you're going to get pretty close. Like,
hey, like, how much time do you want
 
hey, like, how much time do you want
leaders and managers to spend on
 
leaders and managers to spend on
understanding themselves? How important
 
understanding themselves? How important
is self-awareness to you? And what level
 
is self-awareness to you? And what level
do you think people, let's just start
 
do you think people, let's just start
with your directs as a CEO, how
 
with your directs as a CEO, how
self-aware is everybody? And how much
 
self-aware is everybody? And how much
time do you want to spend on that? And
 
time do you want to spend on that? And
that the answer is, you know, I think
 
that the answer is, you know, I think
people are pretty self-aware and I think
 
people are pretty self-aware and I think
we should maybe spend a little bit of
 
we should maybe spend a little bit of
time on it, but not a lot to no. I think
 
time on it, but not a lot to no. I think
there is a huge self-awareness problem
 
there is a huge self-awareness problem
and I want to get into it and I'm a huge
 
and I want to get into it and I'm a huge
believer in organizational psychology
 
believer in organizational psychology
and let's go for it. Interesting. My my
 
and let's go for it. Interesting. My my
view on that has always been
 
view on that has always been
like maybe it's just been selection bias
 
like maybe it's just been selection bias
but the majority of CEOs who I've worked
 
but the majority of CEOs who I've worked
with are tactile
 
with are tactile
learners and so what tend what tends to
 
learners and so what tend what tends to
happen is you know we fire somebody
 
happen is you know we fire somebody
which is now we have an open role
 
which is now we have an open role
and we think about all of the things
 
and we think about all of the things
that didn't work and we get really clear
 
that didn't work and we get really clear
about coming up with assessments
 
about coming up with assessments
to ensure that like we filter for those
 
to ensure that like we filter for those
things very strongly because like those
 
things very strongly because like those
like the organism had an adverse
 
like the organism had an adverse
reaction to that thing. Yeah. I mean
 
reaction to that thing. Yeah. I mean

kind of been more of a coalescing on one
 
kind of been more of a coalescing on one
like I said these key behaviors and
 
like I said these key behaviors and
values. But back to your question of
 
values. But back to your question of
like do I think that a lot of CEOs look
 
like do I think that a lot of CEOs look
to be more surgical? I kind of the way I

what role did the organization play and
 
what role did the organization play and
really there is responsibility again in
 
really there is responsibility again in
conscious leadership the concept of
 
conscious leadership the concept of
having it isn't responsibility isn't a
 
having it isn't responsibility isn't a
pie that we divide that it isn't, you

being able to describe what is your 100%
 
being able to describe what is your 100%

there's a lot of heroes out there that
try to take up more than 100%. Like, oh,
 
try to take up more than 100%. Like, oh,
I'm gonna go save that person. I'm going
 
I'm gonna go save that person. I'm going
to go, you know, I whatever. So, having
 
to go, you know, I whatever. So, having
that kind of a
 
that kind of a
conversation opens it up and and again,
 
conversation opens it up and and again,
as a candidate, I have now those
 
as a candidate, I have now those
examples of situations that I talk
 
examples of situations that I talk
through with a CEO or even other peers,
 
through with a CEO or even other peers,
right? Because I want to be that person
 
right? Because I want to be that person
to start that helps every one of them. I
 
to start that helps every one of them. I
need every one of them to want to come
 
need every one of them to want to come
to me to to support them in challenges
 
to me to to support them in challenges
like this. And so we talk through how
 
like this. And so we talk through how
they would want to do it and how they've
 
they would want to do it and how they've
dealt with it before and what would they
 
dealt with it before and what would they
want to do differently and how would you
 
want to do differently and how would you
know what questions are they going to
 
know what questions are they going to
ask of me what do they expect me to
 
ask of me what do they expect me to
bring what are they ready to bring etc.
 
bring what are they ready to bring etc.
Got it. Well so you you know you talk
 
Got it. Well so you you know you talk
about you know being the candidate side.
 
about you know being the candidate side.
What I find being a candidate on if we
 
What I find being a candidate on if we
think about it as like you know the
 
think about it as like you know the
there's companies and candidates there's
 
there's companies and candidates there's
so much
 
so much
more asymmetry like you don't know
 
more asymmetry like you don't know
what's happening inside of the thing
 
what's happening inside of the thing
like it's so like companies generally
 
like it's so like companies generally
like can figure this stuff out through
 
like can figure this stuff out through
trial and error through some of the
 
trial and error through some of the
things that you're describing and they
 
things that you're describing and they
generally get clear and if even the
 
generally get clear and if even the
company doesn't know typically the early
 
company doesn't know typically the early
employees know especially for startups
 
employees know especially for startups
like the early employees are generally
 
like the early employees are generally
the ones who generally know what's up
 
the ones who generally know what's up
and who's going to work and who's not
 
and who's going to work and who's not
going to work. How do you figure it out
 
going to work. How do you figure it out
on the candidate side when there is so
 
on the candidate side when there is so
much
 
much
opacity like in the pro like how how are
 
opacity like in the pro like how how are
you digging to figure out is this going
 
you digging to figure out is this going
to work for me
 
to work for me
and what are the things that they're not
 
and what are the things that they're not
saying that I should know like how are
 
saying that I should know like how are
you thinking about going through that
 
you thinking about going through that
process? Yeah, first thing is just the
 
process? Yeah, first thing is just the
highlevel data on things and again
 
highlevel data on things and again
that's business performance and then
 
that's business performance and then
it's you know people performance and
 
it's you know people performance and
product
 
product
performance and it's a little bit of a
 
performance and it's a little bit of a
maturity assessment on those three
 
maturity assessment on those three
things. Tell me about the financial
 
things. Tell me about the financial
reporting and the financial forecasting
 
reporting and the financial forecasting
and what's been your accuracy the last
 
and what's been your accuracy the last
three quarters that you've done or last
 
three quarters that you've done or last
year that you did whatever. Then you go
 
year that you did whatever. Then you go
to the product and you say great what's
 
to the product and you say great what's
your road map look like and you know how
 
your road map look like and you know how
accurate have you been how many of your
 
accurate have you been how many of your
releases have delivered on time and
 
releases have delivered on time and
what's been the test case test pass
 
what's been the test case test pass
ratio and what's been customer feedback
 
ratio and what's been customer feedback
and do you even have a customer advocacy
 
and do you even have a customer advocacy
committee that reviews stuff and gives
 
committee that reviews stuff and gives
you direct feedback right like there's
 
you direct feedback right like there's
all this assessment stuff that that you
 
all this assessment stuff that that you
can throw out there at them and so th
 
can throw out there at them and so th
that's the first step and then it's it
 
that's the first step and then it's it
is a little bit of building out these
 
is a little bit of building out these
questions shares of who you want to talk
 
questions shares of who you want to talk
to. That's, you know, that's another
 
to. That's, you know, that's another
piece of advice. Nine times out of 10,
 
piece of advice. Nine times out of 10,
you're probably talking to the panel
 
you're probably talking to the panel
that the executive recruiter and the
 
that the executive recruiter and the
firm has created for them or in
 
firm has created for them or in
partnership with them. I tend to request
 
partnership with them. I tend to request
more people and more experiences than
 
more people and more experiences than
those firms offer. And people get scared
 
those firms offer. And people get scared
about that like duration and number of
 
about that like duration and number of
people and what you know, oh now you're
 
people and what you know, oh now you're
introducing different people that I
 
introducing different people that I
slash the CEO don't want involved in the
 
slash the CEO don't want involved in the
assessment process. So you've got to
 
assessment process. So you've got to
help them navigate that. And again,
 
help them navigate that. And again,
that's probably a that's probably the
 
that's probably a that's probably the
job that you're about to go take, right?
 
job that you're about to go take, right?
Like they aren't they don't know how to
 
Like they aren't they don't know how to
deal with that necessarily. And the
 
deal with that necessarily. And the
recruiter is probably telling them,
 
recruiter is probably telling them,
don't add anybody else. You don't want
 
don't add anybody else. You don't want
any more voices in this room. You don't.
 
any more voices in this room. You don't.
So, you know, again, I want to talk to,
 
So, you know, again, I want to talk to,
you know, whether it's other executives,
 
you know, whether it's other executives,
particularly if I learn about conflict
 
particularly if I learn about conflict
or learn about some blemish, I'm
 
or learn about some blemish, I'm
probably going to want to try to talk to
 
probably going to want to try to talk to
that person. I'm also going to want to
 
that person. I'm also going to want to
understand a little bit about the team.
 
understand a little bit about the team.
We get super scared about that, too.
 
We get super scared about that, too.
Wanting to either interview or part or
 
Wanting to either interview or part or
meet with the team for two reasons. Are
 
meet with the team for two reasons. Are
they going to like me? and all of a
 
they going to like me? and all of a
sudden now I'm not going to be a
 
sudden now I'm not going to be a
candidate because the ca because the
 
candidate because the ca because the
team doesn't like me or two I'm going to
 
team doesn't like me or two I'm going to
find out that maybe there's skill
 
find out that maybe there's skill
deficiencies and that there's going to
 
deficiencies and that there's going to
have to be changes right away and maybe
 
have to be changes right away and maybe
there's all this again it all comes down
 
there's all this again it all comes down
to fear I'm afraid of what's going to
 
to fear I'm afraid of what's going to
happen and instead if we just like sit
 
happen and instead if we just like sit
with that fear and be like cool like
 
with that fear and be like cool like
whatever is going to happen is gonna
 
whatever is going to happen is gonna
happen I know that this is what I want
 
happen I know that this is what I want
to be able to experience to make the
 
to be able to experience to make the
best decision possible
 
best decision possible
for me and for the company. You gain
 
for me and for the company. You gain
that confidence to be able to
 
that confidence to be able to
participate in that. The last thing I
 
participate in that. The last thing I
did on this last search was I wanted to
 
did on this last search was I wanted to
participate in a reall life activity
 
participate in a reall life activity
that the team was doing around culture
 
that the team was doing around culture
and that allowed me to see how the team
 
and that allowed me to see how the team
interacted and right they when you're
 
interacted and right they when you're
working in a real world example just
 
working in a real world example just
like we know works for candidates you
 
like we know works for candidates you
learn way more than you do in a
 
learn way more than you do in a
behavioral interview and so push the
 
behavioral interview and so push the
envelope that way to be able to
 
envelope that way to be able to
experience how does the exec team debate
 
experience how does the exec team debate
something? How does the exec team make a
 
something? How does the exec team make a
decision about something? How does the
 
decision about something? How does the
exec team or whoever you're working with
 
exec team or whoever you're working with
even, you know, approach a problem? Do
 
even, you know, approach a problem? Do
they approach it like Amazon and
 
they approach it like Amazon and
everybody reads a piece of paper or is
 
everybody reads a piece of paper or is
it a blank sheet of paper and
 
it a blank sheet of paper and
everybody's just throwing things around
 
everybody's just throwing things around
and nobody has an agenda and it's all
 
and nobody has an agenda and it's all
free-for-all, whatever, right? Like just
 
free-for-all, whatever, right? Like just
every one of these things, you get a lot
 
every one of these things, you get a lot
of data points from advocating for that.
 
of data points from advocating for that.
I always say there's no substitute for
 
I always say there's no substitute for
time in relationships.
 
time in relationships.
And with exec search, there is a there's
 
And with exec search, there is a there's
a desire to just like get it done,
 
a desire to just like get it done,
right? Because typically it's a big
 
right? Because typically it's a big
hole, right? It sucks, right? You know,
 
hole, right? It sucks, right? You know,
to to use the same analogy is like
 
to to use the same analogy is like
dating sucks, right? Having an open role
 
dating sucks, right? Having an open role
and then dating a bunch of candidates
 
and then dating a bunch of candidates
sucks. Takes forever. And so a lot of
 
sucks. Takes forever. And so a lot of
people on both sides on the company and
 
people on both sides on the company and
the candidate side are just like like
 
the candidate side are just like like
let's just trying to accelerate this
 
let's just trying to accelerate this
thing and to keep the analogy it's like
 
thing and to keep the analogy it's like
a shotgun marriage and most of those
 
a shotgun marriage and most of those
turn out like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] disasters it turns
 
turn out like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] disasters it turns
out and and some of them work right but
 
out and and some of them work right but
most of them do not work out super well
 
most of them do not work out super well
to your point on the real life work
 
to your point on the real life work
example I did the same thing at Carta.
 
example I did the same thing at Carta.
So, at
 
So, at
Carta, I met with like seven people.
 
Carta, I met with like seven people.
They were like, "Oh, we want to send an
 
They were like, "Oh, we want to send an
offer." And I'm like, "That's great. I
 
offer." And I'm like, "That's great. I
don't really know anything about how you
 
don't really know anything about how you
guys work." And you don't know how I
 
guys work." And you don't know how I
work. All you know is that I answered a
 
work. All you know is that I answered a
bunch of like behavioral questions and
 
bunch of like behavioral questions and
told you about stuff in my past, which
 
told you about stuff in my past, which
may or may not be
 
may or may not be
true. Like, I actually want to spend
 
true. Like, I actually want to spend
more time with you. And oh by the and I
 
more time with you. And oh by the and I
designed the essentially the take-home
 
designed the essentially the take-home
which was like hey we're going to grow
 
which was like hey we're going to grow
this many people. This is what the team
 
this many people. This is what the team
needs to look like. I'm going to go
 
needs to look like. I'm going to go
present that and we're going to
 
present that and we're going to
essentially use this as our first body
 
essentially use this as our first body
of work that if you guys agree with
 
of work that if you guys agree with
we're going to use this as our operating
 
we're going to use this as our operating
model for the first
 
model for the first
quarter. And that got so much clarity on
 
quarter. And that got so much clarity on
my working relationship with people
 
my working relationship with people
which is part of the reason I accepted
 
which is part of the reason I accepted
the offer. But it, you know, a lot of
 
the offer. But it, you know, a lot of
execs kind of have this like I'm too
 
execs kind of have this like I'm too
good for a case study or take-home sort
 
good for a case study or take-home sort
of a thing attitude. And I think that's
 
of a thing attitude. And I think that's
bad for them. Absolutely. Humility is a
 
bad for them. Absolutely. Humility is a
part of this. Vulnerability is a big
 
part of this. Vulnerability is a big
part of this. Being
 
part of this. Being
vulnerable. We're going to face crazy
 
vulnerable. We're going to face crazy
challenges every for those of us who are
 
challenges every for those of us who are
like, "Oh, the pandemic can was that's
 
like, "Oh, the pandemic can was that's
the biggest thing we're going to all
 
the biggest thing we're going to all
have to deal with." Well, you know, here
 
have to deal with." Well, you know, here
we are, right? like we're on our third,
 
we are, right? like we're on our third,
you know, kind of workplace traumatic
 
you know, kind of workplace traumatic
huge huge magnitude
 
huge huge magnitude
change in the current period. You know,
 
change in the current period. You know,
that level we're going to face that
 
that level we're going to face that
uncertainty together. And knowing how
 
uncertainty together. And knowing how
people work in those environments is
 
people work in those environments is
really important. To tack on to what you
 
really important. To tack on to what you
shared, I had another experience where I
 
shared, I had another experience where I
built the budget for the upcoming year
 
built the budget for the upcoming year
with the CEO and asked them to sign up
 
with the CEO and asked them to sign up
for it or us to revise it prior to me
 
for it or us to revise it prior to me
accepting the offer, you know, because I
 
accepting the offer, you know, because I
didn't want to walk into not knowing how
 
didn't want to walk into not knowing how
much headcount I had, not knowing how
 
much headcount I had, not knowing how
much investment I had, not knowing which
 
much investment I had, not knowing which
system, like I wanted to know a number
 
system, like I wanted to know a number
and I wanted to know that the CFO was
 
and I wanted to know that the CFO was
signed off as much as the CEO was signed
 
signed off as much as the CEO was signed
off and we were obviously realistic
 
off and we were obviously realistic
where it wasn't going to be exactly that
 
where it wasn't going to be exactly that
number, but I knew I wasn't two
 
number, but I knew I wasn't two
magnitudes off. Exactly. And it turns
 
magnitudes off. Exactly. And it turns
out that often
 
out that often
times when you don't make the implicit
 
times when you don't make the implicit
explicit, you can be many magnitudes off
 
explicit, you can be many magnitudes off
and then be like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like what
 
and then be like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like what
what did I just walk into?" which really
 
what did I just walk into?" which really
is like the worst situation to be in
 
is like the worst situation to be in
considering that you know outside of you
 
considering that you know outside of you
know who you marry and where you live
 
know who you marry and where you live
where you work is like the next biggest
 
where you work is like the next biggest
