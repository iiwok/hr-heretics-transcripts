what's up everybody welcome back to
another segment of HR Heretics today
we're going to talk about two things the
first is candidates cheating on
interviews with AI and the second is a
prevalence of fake candidates so let me
set the scene Kelly so the First with
candidates cheating on AI there is now
multiple software companies who provide
a co-pilot to candidates that are
interviewing over zoom and essentially
what happens is is the the interviewer
will ask a question and the co-pilot
listens to that question and then spits
out an answer for the candidate to read
and so um Allan price who's the head of
recruiting it deal uh just blasted it to
his entire network being like has has
anyone seen this like does anyone want
to like talk about this and like get a
webinar together 150 Talent leaders
responded to him saying yes so I think
it's happening a lot more often I think
Talent leaders are starting to become
aware of it what is your take on these
candidates that are cheating in
interviews with a yeah I don't know
about you all out there but I just told
Nolan before started recording all this
makes my head want to explode because I
feel like overnight everything has
gotten really complicated really complex
I know we'll talk about you know fake
candidates next but all this together uh
it it makes my head want to explode it
really does and look I think cheating
has been something it's been there
forever do you know what I mean like
cheating in school when I was 12 years
old people did it so this is I think a
new version of you know something that's
always been out there but this is
extremely like powerful like you know
people now they'll they'll be on Zoom
calls and they'll have chat GPT up and
just be right as the meeting's going on
use it like very quickly so you know I
know we talked about is there a way the
question is is there a way to stop this
or detect it um again more and more
people are being getting so Savvy around
these tools that are very very
intelligent so it's going to be really
difficult but for me noan we should talk
about this because and then there's the
human El element I can do well and I can
use Ai and I can cheat on interviews
what happens when I start
working like so
yeah I have like a few you know what I
mean fake it until you don't perform or
you shouldn't get the it's very
difficult for me to connect those two
yeah I'm of I'm of two minds here so one
is is like interviews are insanely high
stakes right and they're very
competitive especially in today's world
where there are just fewer jobs and more
competitive talent for those
roles um and so I feel like it is
obviously unfair if someone is is using
something like this um the craziest part
Kelly is like I've seen some of these
videos like some of these videos on Tik
Tok have gotten like 10 million views
and it's basically like somebody coming
into somebody's apartment and it's like
oh my brother is cheating on his
interview with Goldman Sachs and the
camera kind of like looks at the brother
who's talking on Zoom to the interviewer
and you can see the co-pilot app up
listening to the interviewer ask the
question and then spit out the answer
and then the guy reads it as the answer
um so I like one it's like clearly
unfair to the pipeline two it's like I
mean seriously if you're an interviewer
and you can't tell somebody's reading
something off the screen like I think
that's you have a problem that said I
think it's going to continue to get even
better and better right like I can
imagine wearing headphones and actually
having the the answer being told into my
headphones and then spoken out to the to
the interviewer a quarterback right with
the plays you just can't even tell
exactly so so I'm of that's like my
first thought is like I do think there
is going to be some detection software
that companies are going to have to
start thinking about um my my second
thought
is uh if you're not cheating you ain't
trying um
and I kind of like the like first of all
if an interviewer is so dumb like this
AI is not that great yet right like
everyone seeing this like there's
definitely holes in it um yeah and so if
you're if you're just reading directly
off of AI you're going to there's going
to be some major holes in the things
that you're saying yes and so if they if
the if the company is not smart enough
to detect that without some sort of
detection system like the company's just
dumb but the other piece
is I want people to be AI native you
know I want people leaning into like the
most recent technology and so there is
certainly a moral uh and fairness and
and meritocratic issue here but I think
we are in this era of displacement to
where everything's being turned on its
head with AI and people are trying to
figure out like well how can I use it to
my advantage yeah I love it I love it
Nolan's appreciating the hustlers out
there hey if you're not using this
you're behind the times so you're not a
good candidate I was thinking about this
and I go you know to the to like what
what can AI not displace like at least
at the moment um maybe one day it will
uh that I think we might accent more on
because of this phenomenon right so the
how of the person right like how they
work how what they care about their
values do you viscerally connect with
this human being I think you can accent
more on those elements of an inter
interview right I mean it'd be pretty
hilarious if if I asked you about kind
of some character you know value and
you're reading Ai and AI answer so I
think you might have more Accent on
right the the the soft pieces if you
will or what not second more questions
that that are difficult for AI to answer
at the moment with um with with a lot of
kind of backing behind it right more
questions about your personal experience
um literally what you did in a deep
manner at companies you were at right
almost like the the top grading method
right of interviewing like take me
through and unpack your journey your
wise your this that that's more
difficult as far as like chat GPT why
did I leave this company and what did I
learn like yeah so I think you're going
to see more Accent on those types of
things we talked about work trials long
time ago yeah like unless you have a
hologram it's pretty hard to have a you
know a work trial that's a really good
point I think you know I hadn't thought
about that direct line but I think
you're exactly right which is I do think
we're going to see uh more simulation
type of
interviews to detect these sorts of
things we've always said on this show
that we think interviewing is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and so like you know it's just it's so
performative there's so many errors like
nobody's actually really good at it and
so the best way to actually assess
somebody is through a simulation or some
sort of work trial and yeah it could be
that moment this could be the moment of
like well we got to do it because now
everyone's cheating or everyone has
access to should cheat these interviews
um which could be net positive for
companies and
state hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors Real Talk most Talent leaders
haven't yet cracked how to leverage AI
for Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effectively using AI to
transform their recruiting teams
efficiency and quality use metaview
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a
timesaver because perfect notes means
perfect data for every candidate in
every pipeline hiring teams can make
confident informed decisions and talent
leaders can finally take control of the
interview process join Forward Thinking
Talent leaders at high performing
organizations like brex hellofresh and
quora and check out medavie head over to
med. a/h Heritage to talk to one of
metav View's product experts or get
started for free you'll be UPR running
an AI enabled in
minutes I was thinking like if I was
leading ta right now you got to be smart
about AI you have to know what's out
there and use it in different ways and I
would really start to to start creating
more quality experiences if you will
more deep types of interviews that that
talk about things that AI can't cheat on
immediately and to your point that might
as an industry that you might see things
slow down because of that you might see
you know quality versus quantity and
speed so those are things that might
come out of this and then was thinking
of what what could
be tough about that and you know
thinking about the Hustler mindset and
and the lazy way you know if you hire
someone you
know then you get around the whole thing
like that's my concern is that and we
know all know that referrals hiring
people we know bias homo homo genius
like cultures like that might be a bad
byproduct of this because I've worked
with you for 10 years or know you from
college I can hire you and not you're
not a fake candidate you're probably not
cheating like unless and so you might
see more of these ancestral type of
situations and that's not good for
diversity and all those things so that's
my fear wow I hadn't considered it
really bringing it today I hadn't
considered it and I think you're totally
right the other thing I'll just say that
um that you validate that you just said
is you know Sam Alman when they were
asking him uh like what is going to be
the hardest thing to replace with AI
they said it's like the the soft skill
stuff like all the the um the hard
school like the math people are getting
crushed right now because AI is like
making them more affected my engineering
team told me Kelly they're using cursor
now and it's helping them write 40 to
 
code that's crazy and I love I love how
we just coin them the math people that
is hilarious and I
want that what Sam said the math people
yeah okay yeah I me look if I could just
sum it up it's what what can AI not
defend against right what what do we
still have and I think you'll see more
of that infiltrating into these proc I
agree okay let's talk about um the
second piece here which is fake
candidates so I have a friend who does
agency
recruiting and he texted me last week
and he goes noan you got to cover fake
candidates I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are
you talking about fake candidates and he
goes there's this this phenomenon that's
happening right now to where um it's
primarily it looks like Asian men who
are interviewing um with tech companies
they all have like these Stellar bit it
looks like Stellar resumes on LinkedIn
they worked at Apple or meta or
Amazon um and they're getting these
interviews and it turns out like they're
completely Liars but they are actually
pretty good
interviewers um and I was like what is
the possible reasoning for this and to
stop you in case anyone's confused are
these real humans when candidates
they're real they're real humans but
they are lying about their backgrounds
and the theory is is that they're
they're doing this with multiple
companies so they're getting multiple
jobs
simultaneously and as I've gone deep now
down the Reddit hole on this this is a
problem um and the theory is it's either
the CCP trying to infiltrate tech
companies or it's North Korea basically
trying to fund their
government so what's your take on
that I mean I thought my head was
exploding at the first part of this wild
so yeah I mean look okay just to just to
go full Foundation how are they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
getting
hired how like don't we check the
employment records with the name like
how how what do you mean employment
records like you know you do reference
checks background checks you do
reference did they work here did they
work at this company are they in the
system I mean if you don't do that now
you're gonna it's gonna start was hey
meta was Nolan Church's employee in your
HR System I think the thing we're we're
getting at in this episode is that many
companies actually have awful recruiting
practices and people are starting to
exploit
them yeah so I you used the word earlier
we're getting displaced and this is a I
think we're in a a churn like period
right now where we're crossing this
bridge between the old world and the new
world and to your point I I I think the
new world's going to have a lot more
security controls are you did you work
at these places I think that's going to
be a no-brainer you know and one day
it'll be are you a real person so what's
what's it so you're you're actually
talking about a term called proof of
personhood and I kind of thought this
thing was like a joke a couple years ago
when I was hat another hat when I was
hearing people talk about this it's
literally a thing so there's a um
there's a company called worldcoin um
who is offering crypto um if you scan
your iris like that's how you get access
to your wallet and they've actually
expanded into other products because of
that thing because they're worried AI is
going to impersonate humans in the
future yeah I was listening to a podcast
the other day and there's going to be
you know elon's talk there's be robots
like every human's going to have three
robots like one companion one friend one
like absolutely I think we're going to
see a lot of practices changing coming
up because of this
to I don't know like keep control right
create boundaries for for all this stuff
that's coming at at very warp speed and
and it's good in a lot of ways and it's
terrifying in a lot of ways and that
that's the point right that's what
everyone's saying about AI is be careful
what you wish for right don't run around
with scissors be prepared when this
comes and that's what we're talking
about is some of this stuff we are not
prepared so we are not yeah it's it's
honestly like an expect the unexpected
situation and people are smart people
are smart like they have technology
they're smart they they sit around here
all day thinking about the holes and how
to exploit and yeah it does feel like
we're crossing the chasm though of now
technology is finally smarter than us um
or at least it's approaching that aspect
and that's the thing I don't think most
people are comfortable with yet
obviously um and we're leading to these
sorts of behavior so look uh we're in a
weird time in the
world um you know ping me and Kelly I
appreciate the the listeners who pinged
us this week with these two stories
because I didn't think they were serious
at first and the deeper I went down the
rabbit hole the more I learned that
these are like now very serious concerns
well that's my my biggest takeaway for
for the group here all of us friends
like I love to say this when I give
feedback to people awareness is the
first step like you got to be aware like
the fact that we didn't know this a
thing like I think I'm gonna start
reading a little bit more here yep all
right everybody have a good one thanks
