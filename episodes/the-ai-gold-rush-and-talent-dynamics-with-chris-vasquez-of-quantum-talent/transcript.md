Heretics Chris you are running a very
 
Heretics Chris you are running a very
fast growing recruiting agency and I'm
 
fast growing recruiting agency and I'm
really hoping to get a sense of the
 
really hoping to get a sense of the
market from you today and I want to
 
market from you today and I want to
start with the last two years in Tech
 
start with the last two years in Tech
and the narrative has then layoffs cost
 
and the narrative has then layoffs cost
cutting do more with less but like given
 
cutting do more with less but like given
your lens of running an agency working
 
your lens of running an agency working
with early stage Tech specifically like
 
with early stage Tech specifically like
an AI what are you seeing
 
an AI what are you seeing
today look I've been in the recruiting
 
today look I've been in the recruiting
field for 11 years so I've seen a few
 
field for 11 years so I've seen a few
different Cycles I launched the company
 
different Cycles I launched the company
called Quantum four and a half years ago
 
called Quantum four and a half years ago
focused on Venture Capital back startups
 
focused on Venture Capital back startups
and so we've already seen a few
 
and so we've already seen a few
different Evolutions in that small time
 
different Evolutions in that small time
period but I launched the company two
 
period but I launched the company two
months before covid and because of that
 
months before covid and because of that
everything went on freeze which was my
 
everything went on freeze which was my
impetus to start moving to Silicon
 
impetus to start moving to Silicon
Valley because I was working primarily
 
Valley because I was working primarily
in San Diego based companies and
 
in San Diego based companies and
everything went on hold there and then
 
everything went on hold there and then
there was this giant freeze because
 
there was this giant freeze because
people like well we have to cut
 
people like well we have to cut
resources we have to uh preserve Runway
 
resources we have to uh preserve Runway
we don't know when business is going to
 
we don't know when business is going to
be open again and then I think we saw a
 
be open again and then I think we saw a
huge Capital push right we printed a ton
 
huge Capital push right we printed a ton
of money and there was this massive
 
of money and there was this massive
overcorrection right and now we wanted
 
overcorrection right and now we wanted
to grow at all costs companies started
 
to grow at all costs companies started
going crazy it's it was a super exciting
 
going crazy it's it was a super exciting
time in recruiting and Tech in general
 
time in recruiting and Tech in general
but then we realized that we completely
 
but then we realized that we completely
forgot business principles and it was
 
forgot business principles and it was
like growth at all costs you saw
 
like growth at all costs you saw
companies go from a couple hundred to a
 
companies go from a couple hundred to a
couple thousand employees in a couple
 
couple thousand employees in a couple
year time period it was like the gold
 
year time period it was like the gold
rush but then I think what we've seen
 
rush but then I think what we've seen
recently in the last we'll call it year
 
recently in the last we'll call it year
and a half or so is a massive course
 
and a half or so is a massive course
correction back to fundamental
 
correction back to fundamental
businesses strong unit economics and
 
businesses strong unit economics and
just good Sound business principles so
 
just good Sound business principles so
it's been more about growing
 
it's been more about growing
intelligently and I think that's been
 
intelligently and I think that's been
even further highlighted with the boom
 
even further highlighted with the boom
and AI in the last call it one year
 
and AI in the last call it one year
because we're realizing that we can do a
 
because we're realizing that we can do a
lot more with fewer people you got Elon
 
lot more with fewer people you got Elon
who buys Twitter now called X fires I
 
who buys Twitter now called X fires I
think close to 80% of the employees and
 
think close to 80% of the employees and
runs it better than it was run before
 
runs it better than it was run before
and we realized that we had massive
 
and we realized that we had massive
inflated companies where a lot of people
 
inflated companies where a lot of people
weren't doing much at all and then with
 
weren't doing much at all and then with
the influence of AI now and the power
 
the influence of AI now and the power
and leverage of AI we're realizing that
 
and leverage of AI we're realizing that
we can do a lot more with fewer people
 
we can do a lot more with fewer people
and then I think there's this big
 
and then I think there's this big
Paradigm Shift right now to Talent
 
Paradigm Shift right now to Talent
density and it used to be that way I
 
density and it used to be that way I
think if you look at like some of the
 
think if you look at like some of the
best companies PayPal early on with the
 
best companies PayPal early on with the
PayPal Mafia it was just a really Talent
 
PayPal Mafia it was just a really Talent
dense team with remarkable people and
 
dense team with remarkable people and
they accomplished incredible things I
 
they accomplished incredible things I
think we've returned to that we're
 
think we've returned to that we're
seeing Capital come back to I think
 
seeing Capital come back to I think
Venture Capital Market's very healthy
 
Venture Capital Market's very healthy
especially in AI you see a lot of power
 
especially in AI you see a lot of power
being deployed a lot of funds being
 
being deployed a lot of funds being
raised but I think the Paradigm is still
 
raised but I think the Paradigm is still
shifted where people are growing and
 
shifted where people are growing and
there's some serious growth happening
 
there's some serious growth happening
but it's much more intelligent we're
 
but it's much more intelligent we're
looking for more Talent dense people and
 
looking for more Talent dense people and
AI is especially in exciting right now
 
AI is especially in exciting right now
because you can hire these Cutting Edge
 
because you can hire these Cutting Edge
 
amounts of Enterprise valueing companies
 
amounts of Enterprise valueing companies
and you are going to see a handful of
 
and you are going to see a handful of
you know five six seven employee
 
you know five six seven employee
companies build billion dollar companies
 
companies build billion dollar companies
I mean we're seeing companies on our own
 
I mean we're seeing companies on our own
portfolio with 10 15 employees that are
 
portfolio with 10 15 employees that are
already a billion dollar valuations you
 
already a billion dollar valuations you
know so I think it's really really
 
know so I think it's really really
exciting but I think it's more
 
exciting but I think it's more
competitive than ever because there's a
 
competitive than ever because there's a
handful of talent that is creating
 
handful of talent that is creating
exponential returns but there's a huge
 
exponential returns but there's a huge
supply demand shock because it's such a
 
supply demand shock because it's such a
new relative skill set that's what I'm
 
new relative skill set that's what I'm
seeing too and I think there's a
 
seeing too and I think there's a
narrative that AI isn't going to take
 
narrative that AI isn't going to take
jobs and I have a hard time believing
 
jobs and I have a hard time believing
that that's true given the two things
 
that that's true given the two things
that you just discussed which is one the
 
that you just discussed which is one the
technology leverage but then two coming
 
technology leverage but then two coming
out of an era that we just we were
 
out of an era that we just we were
drowning in money and so I think the
 
drowning in money and so I think the
combination of it might it just be the
 
combination of it might it just be the
technology aspect but it's both of these
 
technology aspect but it's both of these
things coming together at once you just
 
things coming together at once you just
said it's very competitive what's your
 
said it's very competitive what's your
take on that I would agree I
 
take on that I would agree I
think look I've seen different cycles
 
think look I've seen different cycles
and there's all these different
 
and there's all these different
industries that have their Heyday right
 
industries that have their Heyday right
crypto about three years ago was insane
 
crypto about three years ago was insane
I think we'll return there AI obviously
 
I think we'll return there AI obviously
is the hot thing right now I think AI
 
is the hot thing right now I think AI
definitely will take jobs you can always
 
definitely will take jobs you can always
position it like it's not AI That's
 
position it like it's not AI That's
going to replace humans it's going to
 
going to replace humans it's going to
assist humans in a lot of ways and just
 
assist humans in a lot of ways and just
make humans more efficient so in some
 
make humans more efficient so in some
ways it's just going to make us better
 
ways it's just going to make us better
at our jobs uh and help us be more
 
at our jobs uh and help us be more
productive and spend more time in our
 
productive and spend more time in our
areas of genius and it's going to help
 
areas of genius and it's going to help
people in that way but you can't look at
 
people in that way but you can't look at
it from a myopic view it's certainly
 
it from a myopic view it's certainly
going to replace jobs I'm working with
 
going to replace jobs I'm working with
dozens of companies that are disrupting
 
dozens of companies that are disrupting
verticals whether it's insurance or
 
verticals whether it's insurance or
health care or the legal system if you
 
health care or the legal system if you
look at Harvey AI I mean they're going
 
look at Harvey AI I mean they're going
to make 80% or more of Associates at
 
to make 80% or more of Associates at
legal firms relevant in the next decade
 
legal firms relevant in the next decade
right or less and so you have customer
 
right or less and so you have customer
service you a lot of lower level and I
 
service you a lot of lower level and I
don't mean that in demeaning way I just
 
don't mean that in demeaning way I just
mean like there it doesn't require
 
mean like there it doesn't require
exceptional skills or exceptional
 
exceptional skills or exceptional
emotional intelligence those jobs will
 
emotional intelligence those jobs will
for sure get displaced it's almost like
 
for sure get displaced it's almost like
the like the non-exempt criteria Chris
 
the like the non-exempt criteria Chris
like repetitive exactly lot Jud way Uber
 
like repetitive exactly lot Jud way Uber
Uber launched when it was
 
Uber launched when it was
 
completely disrupted the taxi game right
 
completely disrupted the taxi game right
but now look we're GNA have self-driving
 
but now look we're GNA have self-driving
cars disrupting Uber right we're having
 
cars disrupting Uber right we're having
a whole another paradigm shift I mean we
 
a whole another paradigm shift I mean we
don't even need drivers soon it's pretty
 
don't even need drivers soon it's pretty
wild and so if you look at all these
 
wild and so if you look at all these
different uh Industries there's a ton of
 
different uh Industries there's a ton of
redundant work being done and there's a
 
redundant work being done and there's a
lot of expensive there's a lot of
 
lot of expensive there's a lot of
expensive payroll for people that make a
 
expensive payroll for people that make a
lot of very common errors don't work
 
lot of very common errors don't work
that hard and you gota you got to pay up
 
that hard and you gota you got to pay up
a lot of money for them and AI is just
 
a lot of money for them and AI is just
going to do the jobs better so like I
 
going to do the jobs better so like I
think it's both cases I think you got to
 
think it's both cases I think you got to
look at it through an optimistic lens
 
look at it through an optimistic lens
and say Hey how do I leverage AI to
 
and say Hey how do I leverage AI to
become more valuable and to 10x my
 
become more valuable and to 10x my
productivity and Effectiveness but you
 
productivity and Effectiveness but you
got to be realistic it's for sure going
 
got to be realistic it's for sure going
to displace a lot of people yeah and a
 
to displace a lot of people yeah and a
and AI is fairly new right I think we're
 
and AI is fairly new right I think we're
a couple years in the whole thing and
 
a couple years in the whole thing and
it's it's the new wave right everyone's
 
it's it's the new wave right everyone's
talking about it and blah blah blah so
 
talking about it and blah blah blah so
kind of a spicy CR question Chris like
 
kind of a spicy CR question Chris like
what what are people kind of Faking it
 
what what are people kind of Faking it
till they making it around do you know
 
till they making it around do you know
what I mean like what what have we not
 
what I mean like what what have we not
figured out are you seeing companies try
 
figured out are you seeing companies try
stuff or unsure like what are what are
 
stuff or unsure like what are what are
companies or Founders or teams still
 
companies or Founders or teams still
insecure about about AI because I feel
 
insecure about about AI because I feel
like everyone's like we figured it out
 
like everyone's like we figured it out
it's Ai and we're still pretty early so
 
it's Ai and we're still pretty early so
I just would love to know from the
 
I just would love to know from the
underbelly if you're seeing any like
 
underbelly if you're seeing any like
turbulence or speed bumps or or things
 
turbulence or speed bumps or or things
where people aren't really sure what's
 
where people aren't really sure what's
going on because I wor I wonder about
 
going on because I wor I wonder about
that real talk there's a lot of ways to
 
that real talk there's a lot of ways to
answer that I think just like when
 
answer that I think just like when
crypto came out everyone's like well we
 
crypto came out everyone's like well we
got to be on the blockchain it's like no
 
got to be on the blockchain it's like no
you don't like blockchain is but we got
 
you don't like blockchain is but we got
to be honest right it's but everyone has
 
to be honest right it's but everyone has
to think about AI strategy even we're
 
to think about AI strategy even we're
thinking about that as a high-end like
 
thinking about that as a high-end like
service based firm where you wouldn't
 
service based firm where you wouldn't
necessarily think of it but AI strategy
 
necessarily think of it but AI strategy
is I think important for everyone but I
 
is I think important for everyone but I
think there's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cases in
 
think there's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cases in
AI right there's a lot of AI where I'm
 
AI right there's a lot of AI where I'm
like that's a
 
like that's a
basic automation script like that's not
 
basic automation script like that's not
AI it's not self- learning so I think
 
AI it's not self- learning so I think
companies are scrambling to figure out
 
companies are scrambling to figure out
how they fit into this picture right how
 
how they fit into this picture right how
do they use AI to disrupt because they
 
do they use AI to disrupt because they
know if they don't figure it out someone
 
know if they don't figure it out someone
else is going to figure it out so just
 
else is going to figure it out so just
like anything when you build when you go
 
like anything when you build when you go
through a massive bubble in a wave you
 
through a massive bubble in a wave you
have 98% of the products created that
 
have 98% of the products created that
are absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and actually
 
are absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and actually
create no value and then certain people
 
create no value and then certain people
figure it out and win but I feel like
 
figure it out and win but I feel like
everyone feels the pressure to build AI
 
everyone feels the pressure to build AI
whether it's a a growth stage company
 
whether it's a a growth stage company
that wasn't AI first now they're like
 
that wasn't AI first now they're like
all right what's our AI strategy how do
 
all right what's our AI strategy how do
we make ourselves relevant and sexy and
 
we make ourselves relevant and sexy and
create additional utility and then AI
 
create additional utility and then AI
first companies obviously I think are
 
first companies obviously I think are
well positioned here because like you're
 
well positioned here because like you're
building from scratch the right way
 
building from scratch the right way
given absolute current technology but
 
given absolute current technology but
what I found there's a there's a huge
 
what I found there's a there's a huge
Exodus of talent leaving Google deepmind
 
Exodus of talent leaving Google deepmind
and Facebook's fair and Tesla autopilot
 
and Facebook's fair and Tesla autopilot
and like the top labs in the world
 
and like the top labs in the world
there's a lot of researchers leaving and
 
there's a lot of researchers leaving and
they want to find the next startup they
 
they want to find the next startup they
know this is the gold rush they know
 
know this is the gold rush they know
this is the best time in human history
 
this is the best time in human history
to start an AI company but they're just
 
to start an AI company but they're just
looking for the right use case they're
 
looking for the right use case they're
right they looking for the right
 
right they looking for the right
industry to pursue with the right team a
 
industry to pursue with the right team a
lot of them are starting their own
 
lot of them are starting their own
companies but a lot of them are just
 
companies but a lot of them are just
very selective and saying who are the
 
very selective and saying who are the
founders the teams and the use cases
 
founders the teams and the use cases
that I can really buy into some people
 
that I can really buy into some people
want to build Foundation models some are
 
want to build Foundation models some are
looking for vertical application uses
 
looking for vertical application uses
there's just so many different things
 
there's just so many different things
you can build in AI I've never worked
 
you can build in AI I've never worked
with more like 23-year-old Stanford phds
 
with more like 23-year-old Stanford phds
with multi hundred million dollar
 
with multi hundred million dollar
valuations in my life so everyone is is
 
valuations in my life so everyone is is
going we have Stanford professors right
 
going we have Stanford professors right
that have only been academic professors
 
that have only been academic professors
their whole life now starting companies
 
their whole life now starting companies
getting funded by top VCS so there's a
 
getting funded by top VCS so there's a
Gold Rush right now people are are
 
Gold Rush right now people are are
trying to find use cases and so it's
 
trying to find use cases and so it's
it's Uber competitive I'm really curious
 
it's Uber competitive I'm really curious
who's actually going to come out on top
 
who's actually going to come out on top
but I think kind of a Sidetrack here but
 
but I think kind of a Sidetrack here but
but I think there's a lot of people
 
but I think there's a lot of people
trying to do Foundation models and it's
 
trying to do Foundation models and it's
really hard to compete with open Ai and
 
really hard to compete with open Ai and
anthropic and those but there's so many
 
anthropic and those but there's so many
amazing vertical application use cases
 
amazing vertical application use cases
right if you want to disrupt insurance
 
right if you want to disrupt insurance
or health care or whatever it may be but
 
or health care or whatever it may be but
you have some sort of Competitive Edge
 
you have some sort of Competitive Edge
in an industry where you just understand
 
in an industry where you just understand
it better than anyone and you can
 
it better than anyone and you can
acquire a lot of proprietary data and
 
acquire a lot of proprietary data and
then use existing models G GPT whatever
 
then use existing models G GPT whatever
it may be to then become more
 
it may be to then become more
intelligent as a business so there's
 
intelligent as a business so there's
it's it's I think that the Tailwind of
 
it's it's I think that the Tailwind of
value creation happening right now is
 
value creation happening right now is
crazy
 
crazy
exciting Chris I have a friend who's uh
 
exciting Chris I have a friend who's uh
at a series a company that's raised an
 
at a series a company that's raised an
ungodly amount of money because of an AI
 
ungodly amount of money because of an AI
use case I think they actually do have
 
use case I think they actually do have
real utility in real business yeah she
 
real utility in real business yeah she
had mentioned how insane it is with the
 
had mentioned how insane it is with the
engineering Talent right now yeah and
 
engineering Talent right now yeah and
specifically the compensation so she
 
specifically the compensation so she
described it as the wild west she
 
described it as the wild west she
described it as every single one of
 
described it as every single one of
these Engineers has like an N of one
 
these Engineers has like an N of one
Market the the salaries and the equity
 
Market the the salaries and the equity
packages are absolutely crazy she also
 
packages are absolutely crazy she also
mentioned that there's this like call it
 
mentioned that there's this like call it
uh ship jumping that's happening every
 
uh ship jumping that's happening every
 
kind of going and acquiring these
 
kind of going and acquiring these
lottery tickets but her take was really
 
lottery tickets but her take was really
interesting which is I'm not mad about
 
interesting which is I'm not mad about
it like they're coming in and if these
 
it like they're coming in and if these
people are actually really good they're
 
people are actually really good they're
still providing a ton of value to our
 
still providing a ton of value to our
company it's just the game that we're
 
company it's just the game that we're
current currently playing so can you
 
current currently playing so can you
give our listeners a sense for what's
 
give our listeners a sense for what's
actually going on in the talent market
 
actually going on in the talent market
right now for engineers inside of these
 
right now for engineers inside of these
AI companies absolutely I think sorry to
 
AI companies absolutely I think sorry to
the VCS out there who love pave and
 
the VCS out there who love pave and
option impact but I'm sorry to say that
 
option impact but I'm sorry to say that
it completely falls short in this market
 
it completely falls short in this market
it is not the Benchmark you want to look
 
it is not the Benchmark you want to look
at especially in AI talent but we work
 
at especially in AI talent but we work
with hundreds of startups right most of
 
with hundreds of startups right most of
them we start with at seed in series a
 
them we start with at seed in series a
and they're we work with 80% of the tier
 
and they're we work with 80% of the tier
one VCS from Sequoia index besser
 
one VCS from Sequoia index besser
andreon you name it so we have a pretty
 
andreon you name it so we have a pretty
good data pool we're talking to
 
good data pool we're talking to
thousands of candidates a month we have
 
thousands of candidates a month we have
I don't know probably 15 to 20 offers
 
I don't know probably 15 to 20 offers
going out every seven to 10 days and the
 
going out every seven to 10 days and the
close rate's been harder than ever it's
 
close rate's been harder than ever it's
insane but what I can say is this
 
insane but what I can say is this
there's different levels of talent if
 
there's different levels of talent if
you're building a foundation model and
 
you're building a foundation model and
you're needing somebody who's going to
 
you're needing somebody who's going to
create Cutting Edge intellectual
 
create Cutting Edge intellectual
property that your Company Success lives
 
property that your Company Success lives
and dies on you have to go compete for
 
and dies on you have to go compete for
the best in the world and that is
 
the best in the world and that is
insanely competitive if you're just
 
insanely competitive if you're just
looking for an applied machine learning
 
looking for an applied machine learning
engineer to commercialize a product with
 
engineer to commercialize a product with
some GPT rappers like it's still very
 
some GPT rappers like it's still very
competitive but it's a different league
 
competitive but it's a different league
so there's just different levels of
 
so there's just different levels of
talent out here we have startups that
 
talent out here we have startups that
are offering up to $800,000 base
 
are offering up to $800,000 base
salaries for head of AI right now seed
 
salaries for head of AI right now seed
stage startups and we're trying to poach
 
stage startups and we're trying to poach
from open Ai and anthropic and a lot of
 
from open Ai and anthropic and a lot of
these top firms and they're offering one
 
these top firms and they're offering one
to2 million doll cash comp to pretty
 
to2 million doll cash comp to pretty
much everyone it's it's pretty absurd
 
much everyone it's it's pretty absurd
and so you have really inflated roles
 
and so you have really inflated roles
but I would say on General basis for
 
but I would say on General basis for
standard ml engineer you're looking at a
 
standard ml engineer you're looking at a
 
engineering and then if you're looking
 
engineering and then if you're looking
at AI researchers that is the most
 
at AI researchers that is the most
competitive skill set I've seen in the
 
competitive skill set I've seen in the
market right now and we have two-year
 
market right now and we have two-year
researchers with $400,000 and one to
 
researchers with $400,000 and one to
two% offers at Sten series a companies
 
two% offers at Sten series a companies
Chris what are these folks doing to
 
Chris what are these folks doing to
acquire these skills right a lot a lot
 
acquire these skills right a lot a lot
of these folks were not AI Engineers
 
of these folks were not AI Engineers
four years ago right like what what are
 
four years ago right like what what are
how are they from like Stanford programs
 
how are they from like Stanford programs
or just top universities and research
 
or just top universities and research
labs and I don't quite often to see like
 
labs and I don't quite often to see like
traditional backend Engineers or
 
traditional backend Engineers or
something go into cutting a ji usually
 
something go into cutting a ji usually
these people come from Top research Labs
 
these people come from Top research Labs
or top degrees where they got you know
 
or top degrees where they got you know
they specialized in they specialized in
 
they specialized in they specialized in
some form of artificial intelligence or
 
some form of artificial intelligence or
statistics or they had some sort of
 
statistics or they had some sort of

with as a community and that's what I
get really excited about that's where my

Nolan and I don't always like each other
 
Nolan and I don't always like each other
or agree and no we do like each other we
 
or agree and no we do like each other we
don't always agree but we do like each

there's something you're not me and then
 
there's something you're not me and then
I a little insecure no no no no no no
 
I a little insecure no no no no no no
look if we're gonna move past our
 
look if we're gonna move past our
differences we have to be unified by
 
differences we have to be unified by
stronger values than those differences
 
stronger values than those differences
right and so if you're in a company that
 
right and so if you're in a company that
core value could be Excellence like
 
core value could be Excellence like
we're here to do the best work and
 
we're here to do the best work and
create a product or a service that
 
create a product or a service that
really changes the world and you're more
 
really changes the world and you're more
you care more about that than are uing
 
you care more about that than are uing
over your political differences right if
 
over your political differences right if
you're in relationships it's like you
 
you're in relationships it's like you
there's there's deeper bonds than there
 
there's there's deeper bonds than there
are differences you have to make the
 
are differences you have to make the
bonds stronger than the walls right so
 
bonds stronger than the walls right so
we're gonna have things we disagree on
 
we're gonna have things we disagree on
but as long as we keep the fabric of
 
but as long as we keep the fabric of
those relationships and what's important
 
those relationships and what's important
at the Forefront it all that stuff
 
at the Forefront it all that stuff
doesn't matter
 
doesn't matter
totally can I pivot to a question or are
 
totally can I pivot to a question or are
we still yeah please please I think I'm
 
we still yeah please please I think I'm
almost sweating after that but like that
 
almost sweating after that but like that
was great we'll fire it up so like the
 
was great we'll fire it up so like the
we talked about the AI Talent Chris AI
 
we talked about the AI Talent Chris AI
Talent comp Etc I'm curious about
 
Talent comp Etc I'm curious about
Executives in AI as far as like you all
 
Executives in AI as far as like you all
as a recruiting agency your placing AI
 
as a recruiting agency your placing AI
exx I mean if we're only 18 two years 18
 
exx I mean if we're only 18 two years 18
months two years into this phenomenon I
 
months two years into this phenomenon I
have to believe there's not a huge
 
have to believe there's not a huge
supply of AI execs who kind of done this
 
supply of AI execs who kind of done this
or whatnot so who are you placing who
 
or whatnot so who are you placing who
are you finding what are kind of like
 
are you finding what are kind of like
the
 
the
musthave criteria for those execs and
 
musthave criteria for those execs and
what's more of a nice to have so is
 
what's more of a nice to have so is
pretty broad right there's so many use
 
pretty broad right there's so many use
cases you have companies that are
 
cases you have companies that are
building like search and recommendation
 
building like search and recommendation
products right and so you pull those
 
products right and so you pull those
folks you have people that are building
 
folks you have people that are building
like text to voice and voice to text and
 
like text to voice and voice to text and
text to video right looking for
 
text to video right looking for
multimodal people you have core models
 
multimodal people you have core models
right looking for Transformer diffusion
 
right looking for Transformer diffusion
experience there's there's so many
 
experience there's there's so many
different subsets of AI right and
 
different subsets of AI right and
there's different levels of scarcity
 
there's different levels of scarcity
depending on which roles there are some
 
depending on which roles there are some
some of these video companies that are
 
some of these video companies that are
doing animations they want Nerf
 
doing animations they want Nerf
researchers and it feels like there's
 
researchers and it feels like there's
only a couple hundred these people that
 
only a couple hundred these people that
exist in the world there's just some
 
exist in the world there's just some
really really Niche roles out there so
 
really really Niche roles out there so
there's different use cases if you're
 
there's different use cases if you're
looking for like heads of research to
 
looking for like heads of research to
come build Foundation models for use
 
come build Foundation models for use
there's very there's a those are very
 
there's very there's a those are very
hard to find you're gon to pull from Top
 
hard to find you're gon to pull from Top
research Labs or top startups that are
 
research Labs or top startups that are
already building their own models if
 
already building their own models if
you're looking for more of the applied
 
you're looking for more of the applied
side right where it's like hey we
 
side right where it's like hey we
already we're not trying to do anything
 
already we're not trying to do anything
new from a research perspective the
 
new from a research perspective the
existing technology works but we want to
 
existing technology works but we want to
build an application around this using
 
build an application around this using
llms to commercialize a new product
 
llms to commercialize a new product
right it's pretty rare to find people
 
right it's pretty rare to find people
that have already built successful
 
that have already built successful
commercial llm products right so you're
 
commercial llm products right so you're
wi you have a small subset of companies
 
wi you have a small subset of companies
that you can poach from some of the
 
that you can poach from some of the
bigger companies had already applied
 
bigger companies had already applied
that in commercialized products but
 
that in commercialized products but
there's a lot of startups being launched
 
there's a lot of startups being launched
like the Harvey of the world or the
 
like the Harvey of the world or the
Jaspers or the writers whatever it may
 
Jaspers or the writers whatever it may
be um and so you kind of just got to
 
be um and so you kind of just got to
know your do your homework and figure
 
know your do your homework and figure
out who's actually successfully launched
 
out who's actually successfully launched
llm based applications so it really
 
llm based applications so it really
really varies but in
 
really varies but in
general in general we're poaching out of
 
general in general we're poaching out of
top Labs we're poaching out of uh top
 
top Labs we're poaching out of uh top
startups both on the applied and the
 
startups both on the applied and the
research side and then I think the
 
research side and then I think the
interesting thing too executive AI
 
interesting thing too executive AI
search is very different than
 
search is very different than
traditional exec search and the reason I
 
traditional exec search and the reason I
say that is if you look at a CTO at a
 
say that is if you look at a CTO at a
series B or C company they want someone
 
series B or C company they want someone
who can scale an organization to 50 to
 
who can scale an organization to 50 to
 
hit 100 200 million are you're looking
 
hit 100 200 million are you're looking
for a smart technologist and business
 
for a smart technologist and business
strategist but you're looking for
 
strategist but you're looking for
someone who's really good at managing
 
someone who's really good at managing
people and process and ORS with AI you
 
people and process and ORS with AI you
just don't need a big team and so a lot
 
just don't need a big team and so a lot
of our executive searches these these
 
of our executive searches these these
people that are getting Chief AI officer
 
people that are getting Chief AI officer
titles in massive comps much higher than
 
titles in massive comps much higher than
any CTO we place they're managing five
 
any CTO we place they're managing five
to 15 person teams and so they don't
 
to 15 person teams and so they don't
really need the executive level
 
really need the executive level
operations in scale that traditional
 
operations in scale that traditional
execs need but they have to be the
 
execs need but they have to be the
smartest person in the room and bring a
 
smartest person in the room and bring a
lot of credibility right so they're more
 
lot of credibility right so they're more
Merit based technical Excellence yeah
 
Merit based technical Excellence yeah
technical intellectual Excellence so the
 
technical intellectual Excellence so the
smartest leaders that have the most pull
 
smartest leaders that have the most pull
and pedigree to them that are smart and
 
and pedigree to them that are smart and
can just rally small teams that's more
 
can just rally small teams that's more
what the exec look like so it's it's
 
what the exec look like so it's it's
kind of a hybrid between an individual
 
kind of a hybrid between an individual
contributor and an executive level
 
contributor and an executive level
search because you're you're you're
 
search because you're you're you're
poaching researchers for head ofy jobs
 
poaching researchers for head ofy jobs
that have maybe never even managed
 
that have maybe never even managed
before because they have the network and
 
before because they have the network and
they know what they're doing and they
 
they know what they're doing and they
have the strategy and so there's a bit
 
have the strategy and so there's a bit
difference uh in those exec
 
difference uh in those exec
profiles interesting I I want to talk
 
profiles interesting I I want to talk
about the candidate side so you know you
 
about the candidate side so you know you
have this really interesting purview
 
have this really interesting purview
into candidates on one side as you
 
into candidates on one side as you
mentioned earlier who have like 15 to 20
 
mentioned earlier who have like 15 to 20
offers and obviously there's like a
 
offers and obviously there's like a
technical aspect there and there's a
 
technical aspect there and there's a
supply and demand problem then on the
 
supply and demand problem then on the
other side I'm sure you have candidates
 
other side I'm sure you have candidates
who aren't getting
 
who aren't getting
offers and the the thing I want to hear
 
offers and the the thing I want to hear
from you Chris is like what advice do
 
from you Chris is like what advice do
you give to candidates to help them
 
you give to candidates to help them
become more
 
become more
marketable and you know specifically
 
marketable and you know specifically
given the the aperture that you have
 
given the the aperture that you have
what are the best people doing that we
 
what are the best people doing that we
can all learn from that's a very
 
can all learn from that's a very
interesting
 
interesting
question it's very
 
question it's very
interesting it's hard to give
 
interesting it's hard to give
non-general advice there because you
 
non-general advice there because you
kind of have to coach on the court
 
kind of have to coach on the court
versus like give blanket advice of like
 
versus like give blanket advice of like
hey just be better at coding but I think
 
hey just be better at coding but I think
I think communication actually is a big
 
I think communication actually is a big
thing I think a lot of especially we're
 
thing I think a lot of especially we're
doing ahead of AI search right now and
 
doing ahead of AI search right now and
 
communication alone and so I can't help
 
communication alone and so I can't help
someone be a better programmer they're
 
someone be a better programmer they're
gonna have to figure that out themselves
 
gonna have to figure that out themselves
but communication is critical especially
 
but communication is critical especially
when you're tasked with owning a big
 
when you're tasked with owning a big
project or a big product you have to be
 
project or a big product you have to be
excellent communicating and so I would
 
excellent communicating and so I would
advise those candidates to actually
 
advise those candidates to actually
spend time articulating what it is they
 
spend time articulating what it is they
want what it is their good at understand
 
want what it is their good at understand
hey what are the products and systems
 
hey what are the products and systems
you've built to date and actually be
 
you've built to date and actually be
able to speak to those in depth and and
 
able to speak to those in depth and and
listen to questions and actually give
 
listen to questions and actually give
responses that are appropriate for that
 
responses that are appropriate for that
question you got some people that ramble
 
question you got some people that ramble
for five minutes when they're asked to
 
for five minutes when they're asked to
 
emotional intelligence to say what is
 
emotional intelligence to say what is
this person asking can I answer this
 
this person asking can I answer this
quickly and sustin because you don't
 
quickly and sustin because you don't
have time to ramble on these things a
 
have time to ramble on these things a
lot of it is just around communication
 
lot of it is just around communication
is know how to tell your story come in
 
is know how to tell your story come in
with passion do your research on the
 
with passion do your research on the
companies you're interviewing for and
 
companies you're interviewing for and
actually come with thoughtful questions
 
actually come with thoughtful questions
so it shows that you're engaged know
 
so it shows that you're engaged know
your own career history and what you've
 
your own career history and what you've
done so you can speak to your
 
done so you can speak to your
accomplishments in depth make sure your
 
accomplishments in depth make sure your
code's good but at the end of the day
 
code's good but at the end of the day
it's communication and it's if you
 
it's communication and it's if you
haven't thought about certain questions
 
haven't thought about certain questions
that are fairly obvious it might take
 
that are fairly obvious it might take
you 10 minutes to answer them but if you
 
you 10 minutes to answer them but if you
thought about it and you know you're
 
thought about it and you know you're
going to be asked about systems
 
going to be asked about systems
architecture or you know you're going to
 
architecture or you know you're going to
be asked about what model you built you
 
be asked about what model you built you
should understand the bullet points in
 
should understand the bullet points in
advance so you can rattle off and sound
 
advance so you can rattle off and sound
like a genius I think a lot of it it
 
like a genius I think a lot of it it
comes down to communication
 
comes down to communication
yeah so so you disqualified 80% of a
 
yeah so so you disqualified 80% of a
pipeline because they fell short on
 
pipeline because they fell short on
communicating well with other humans
 
communicating well with other humans
absolutely that's very
 
absolutely that's very
interesting it makes total sense to me
 
interesting it makes total sense to me
right Kelly like we know we want to talk
 
right Kelly like we know we want to talk
about soft skills and you know that's
 
about soft skills and you know that's
that's actually I I hear it I I'll just
 
that's actually I I hear it I I'll just
give you a little bit slight of a Nuance
 
give you a little bit slight of a Nuance
on that Chris which is in the the two
 
on that Chris which is in the the two
ways that I think about communication
 
ways that I think about communication
which is one verbal and the other
 
which is one verbal and the other
written and you know there's obviously
 
written and you know there's obviously
verbal aspect of like how are we
 
verbal aspect of like how are we
interacting when you're on the spot and
 
interacting when you're on the spot and
like feeling like a little hot during an
 
like feeling like a little hot during an
interview but then there's this other
 
interview but then there's this other
aspect after you've had time to reflect
 
aspect after you've had time to reflect
and and this is the biggest piece of
 
and and this is the biggest piece of
advice I give friends is if you go into
 
advice I give friends is if you go into
an interview and you have a conversation
 
an interview and you have a conversation
with somebody and if it went well or it
 
with somebody and if it went well or it
didn't go well it doesn't matter what
 
didn't go well it doesn't matter what
you do after matters and like I see
 
you do after matters and like I see
people who are like oh my God I blew an
 
people who are like oh my God I blew an
interview and I'm like great what what
 
interview and I'm like great what what
what you send your follow-up
 
what you send your follow-up
email I didn't send a follow-up email
 
email I didn't send a follow-up email
I'm like well that's that's a missed
 
I'm like well that's that's a missed
opportunity and so I I totally agree
 
opportunity and so I I totally agree
with you and I think like this is going
 
with you and I think like this is going
back to the earlier conversation of like
 
back to the earlier conversation of like
oh AI is taking over and fewer people
 
oh AI is taking over and fewer people
are having jobs Sam Altman just said
 
are having jobs Sam Altman just said
this he's most concerned for the math
 
this he's most concerned for the math
people the the the the the written word
 
people the the the the the written word
and the the spoken word people he has a
 
and the the spoken word people he has a
ton of confidence in that are always
 
ton of confidence in that are always
going to be employable because they
 
going to be employable because they
interact with others as well that is
 
interact with others as well that is
spoton and it's such this kind of like
 
spoton and it's such this kind of like
reverberation effect where AI is going
 
reverberation effect where AI is going
to start displacing people and I think
 
to start displacing people and I think
he or mark andreon one of them said that
 
he or mark andreon one of them said that
he sees a huge opportunity in the next
 
he sees a huge opportunity in the next
decade in in-person highly human
 
decade in in-person highly human
connected events like anything that
 
connected events like anything that
facilitates human connection because
 
facilitates human connection because
we're going to stray further and further
 
we're going to stray further and further
away from it we're gonna
 
away from it we're gonna
be robots are G to be such such a big
 
be robots are G to be such such a big
part of our society and AI that human
 
part of our society and AI that human
connection learning emotional
 
connection learning emotional
intelligence how to connect and interact
 
intelligence how to connect and interact
with people effectively like robots
 
with people effectively like robots
can't do that and so AI can't do that
 
can't do that and so AI can't do that
and so yeah it's a very interesting
 
and so yeah it's a very interesting
thought and I totally agree and that's
 
thought and I totally agree and that's
why high level salespeople they're not
 
why high level salespeople they're not
going to be displaced if you look at law
 
going to be displaced if you look at law
firms the associates they'll be
 
firms the associates they'll be
displaced Partners who need the trust
 
displaced Partners who need the trust
and relationships they need someone to
 
and relationships they need someone to
call at 4 in the morning when everything
 
call at 4 in the morning when everything
goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you cannot put that on a
 
goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you cannot put that on a
robot or some sort of artificial
 
robot or some sort of artificial
intelligence like that comes down to
 
intelligence like that comes down to
human to human trust and connection and
 
human to human trust and connection and
so you should you should know that you
 
so you should you should know that you
have to invest in build in great
 
have to invest in build in great
relationships and people can't replace
 
relationships and people can't replace
that right so it's counterintuitive to
 
that right so it's counterintuitive to
an extent yeah it just it just scared me
 
an extent yeah it just it just scared me
that that that fun fact you know that
 
that that that fun fact you know that
that these folks are going to be kind of
 
that these folks are going to be kind of
running the world if you think about AI
 
running the world if you think about AI
taking over all those things they have
 
taking over all those things they have
very small teams they're taking away
 
very small teams they're taking away
people's jobs and they can't talk to
 
people's jobs and they can't talk to
other people so I just like I think we
 
other people so I just like I think we
have to make sure that that with this
 
have to make sure that that with this
very lots of power and responsibility
 
very lots of power and responsibility
comes that EQ and judgment because that
 
comes that EQ and judgment because that
that definitely scared the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I
 
that definitely scared the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I
think that that's there's going to be a
 
think that that's there's going to be a
huge premium on that moving forward it's
 
huge premium on that moving forward it's
gonna because there's going to be more
 
gonna because there's going to be more
candidates available for jobs we've seen
 
candidates available for jobs we've seen
it for the last two years and the the
 
it for the last two years and the the
technical differences there's a big one
 
technical differences there's a big one
right now just with like ML and like we
 
right now just with like ML and like we
don't have enough ml Engineers but
 
don't have enough ml Engineers but
that's going to the market always finds
 
that's going to the market always finds
an equilibrium and then the thing that's
 
an equilibrium and then the thing that's
going to be the determining factor is
 
going to be the determining factor is
your EQ is how you interact with others
 
your EQ is how you interact with others
is how you communicate so I I love to
 
is how you communicate so I I love to
hear that Chris that gives me even more
 
hear that Chris that gives me even more
optimism about the future that we're
 
optimism about the future that we're
going to build Kelly anything else from
 
going to build Kelly anything else from
you I just a quick quick tidbit anything
 
you I just a quick quick tidbit anything
else on other Industries I mean we love
 
else on other Industries I mean we love
AI but you you you see a lot of things
 
AI but you you you see a lot of things
Chris any other Trends or things going
 
Chris any other Trends or things going
on either by function or industry yeah I
 
on either by function or industry yeah I

I follow the talent right like I'm
 
I follow the talent right like I'm
trying to recruit for crypto companies
 
trying to recruit for crypto companies
right now all these different companies
 
right now all these different companies
deep Tech I can kind of see where the
 
deep Tech I can kind of see where the
smartest people are going right and I
 
smartest people are going right and I
think Talent is a good indication of
 
think Talent is a good indication of
where to be optimistic which is why I'm
 
where to be optimistic which is why I'm
still Uber optimistic on crypto for

right now even in this bare Market I
 
right now even in this bare Market I
think deep Tech is having its Heyday
 
think deep Tech is having its Heyday
right now I think this is the time where
 
right now I think this is the time where
investors are like all right we're

robotics space Tech I think space is
going to be a huge sector in the next 10
 
going to be a huge sector in the next 10
years I mean it's remarkable the
 
years I mean it's remarkable the
advancements we're going there with Elon
 
advancements we're going there with Elon

and the Falcon X and how it's Uber cheap
to send Rockets back to and from space
 
to send Rockets back to and from space
now so we can do it's incredible so I
 
now so we can do it's incredible so I
think space Tech is gonna have a big run

I think chip manufacturing is g to be
 
I think chip manufacturing is g to be
big I think our Reliance in Taiwan and
 
big I think our Reliance in Taiwan and
having 70 plus perc of the chips in
 
having 70 plus perc of the chips in
Taiwan and we have the looming threat
 
Taiwan and we have the looming threat
with China there we're starting to build
 
with China there we're starting to build
facilities in the US I think chips are
 
facilities in the US I think chips are
going to be big and I think gpus I think
 
going to be big and I think gpus I think
the most expensive commodity that we're
 
the most expensive commodity that we're
all everyone's got their eye on is GPU
 
all everyone's got their eye on is GPU
we need we need more we need more chips
 
we need we need more we need more chips
we need more power for for AI and I
 
we need more power for for AI and I
think just became the most valuable
 
think just became the most valuable
company in the world right it's pretty
 
company in the world right it's pretty
insane but we just don't have enough
 
insane but we just don't have enough
compute to support the amount of AI
 
compute to support the amount of AI
companies in scale that we're seeing
 
companies in scale that we're seeing
right now so I think compute is going to
 
right now so I think compute is going to
be a huge opportunity
 
be a huge opportunity
so because of this trend with AI and
 
so because of this trend with AI and
every you know everything else going on
 
every you know everything else going on
