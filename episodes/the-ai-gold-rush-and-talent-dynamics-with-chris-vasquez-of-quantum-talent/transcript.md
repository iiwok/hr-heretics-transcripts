all right everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics Chris you are running a very
fast growing recruiting agency and I'm
really hoping to get a sense of the
market from you today and I want to
start with the last two years in Tech
and the narrative has then layoffs cost
cutting do more with less but like given
your lens of running an agency working
with early stage Tech specifically like
an AI what are you seeing
today look I've been in the recruiting
field for 11 years so I've seen a few
different Cycles I launched the company
called Quantum four and a half years ago
focused on Venture Capital back startups
and so we've already seen a few
different Evolutions in that small time
period but I launched the company two
months before covid and because of that
everything went on freeze which was my
impetus to start moving to Silicon
Valley because I was working primarily
in San Diego based companies and
everything went on hold there and then
there was this giant freeze because
people like well we have to cut
resources we have to uh preserve Runway
we don't know when business is going to
be open again and then I think we saw a
huge Capital push right we printed a ton
of money and there was this massive
overcorrection right and now we wanted
to grow at all costs companies started
going crazy it's it was a super exciting
time in recruiting and Tech in general
but then we realized that we completely
forgot business principles and it was
like growth at all costs you saw
companies go from a couple hundred to a
couple thousand employees in a couple
year time period it was like the gold
rush but then I think what we've seen
recently in the last we'll call it year
and a half or so is a massive course
correction back to fundamental
businesses strong unit economics and
just good Sound business principles so
it's been more about growing
intelligently and I think that's been
even further highlighted with the boom
and AI in the last call it one year
because we're realizing that we can do a
lot more with fewer people you got Elon
who buys Twitter now called X fires I
think close to 80% of the employees and
runs it better than it was run before
and we realized that we had massive
inflated companies where a lot of people
weren't doing much at all and then with
the influence of AI now and the power
and leverage of AI we're realizing that
we can do a lot more with fewer people
and then I think there's this big
Paradigm Shift right now to Talent
density and it used to be that way I
think if you look at like some of the
best companies PayPal early on with the
PayPal Mafia it was just a really Talent
dense team with remarkable people and
they accomplished incredible things I
think we've returned to that we're
seeing Capital come back to I think
Venture Capital Market's very healthy
especially in AI you see a lot of power
being deployed a lot of funds being
raised but I think the Paradigm is still
shifted where people are growing and
there's some serious growth happening
but it's much more intelligent we're
looking for more Talent dense people and
AI is especially in exciting right now
because you can hire these Cutting Edge
 
amounts of Enterprise valueing companies
and you are going to see a handful of
you know five six seven employee
companies build billion dollar companies
I mean we're seeing companies on our own
portfolio with 10 15 employees that are
already a billion dollar valuations you
know so I think it's really really
exciting but I think it's more
competitive than ever because there's a
handful of talent that is creating
exponential returns but there's a huge
supply demand shock because it's such a
new relative skill set that's what I'm
seeing too and I think there's a
narrative that AI isn't going to take
jobs and I have a hard time believing
that that's true given the two things
that you just discussed which is one the
technology leverage but then two coming
out of an era that we just we were
drowning in money and so I think the
combination of it might it just be the
technology aspect but it's both of these
things coming together at once you just
said it's very competitive what's your
take on that I would agree I
think look I've seen different cycles
and there's all these different
industries that have their Heyday right
crypto about three years ago was insane
I think we'll return there AI obviously
is the hot thing right now I think AI
definitely will take jobs you can always
position it like it's not AI That's
going to replace humans it's going to
assist humans in a lot of ways and just
make humans more efficient so in some
ways it's just going to make us better
at our jobs uh and help us be more
productive and spend more time in our
areas of genius and it's going to help
people in that way but you can't look at
it from a myopic view it's certainly
going to replace jobs I'm working with
dozens of companies that are disrupting
verticals whether it's insurance or
health care or the legal system if you
look at Harvey AI I mean they're going
to make 80% or more of Associates at
legal firms relevant in the next decade
right or less and so you have customer
service you a lot of lower level and I
don't mean that in demeaning way I just
mean like there it doesn't require
exceptional skills or exceptional
emotional intelligence those jobs will
for sure get displaced it's almost like
the like the non-exempt criteria Chris
like repetitive exactly lot Jud way Uber
Uber launched when it was
 
completely disrupted the taxi game right
but now look we're GNA have self-driving
cars disrupting Uber right we're having
a whole another paradigm shift I mean we
don't even need drivers soon it's pretty
wild and so if you look at all these
different uh Industries there's a ton of
redundant work being done and there's a
lot of expensive there's a lot of
expensive payroll for people that make a
lot of very common errors don't work
that hard and you gota you got to pay up
a lot of money for them and AI is just
going to do the jobs better so like I
think it's both cases I think you got to
look at it through an optimistic lens
and say Hey how do I leverage AI to
become more valuable and to 10x my
productivity and Effectiveness but you
got to be realistic it's for sure going
to displace a lot of people yeah and a
and AI is fairly new right I think we're
a couple years in the whole thing and
it's it's the new wave right everyone's
talking about it and blah blah blah so
kind of a spicy CR question Chris like
what what are people kind of Faking it
till they making it around do you know
what I mean like what what have we not
figured out are you seeing companies try
stuff or unsure like what are what are
companies or Founders or teams still
insecure about about AI because I feel
like everyone's like we figured it out
it's Ai and we're still pretty early so
I just would love to know from the
underbelly if you're seeing any like
turbulence or speed bumps or or things
where people aren't really sure what's
going on because I wor I wonder about
that real talk there's a lot of ways to
answer that I think just like when
crypto came out everyone's like well we
got to be on the blockchain it's like no
you don't like blockchain is but we got
to be honest right it's but everyone has
to think about AI strategy even we're
thinking about that as a high-end like
service based firm where you wouldn't
necessarily think of it but AI strategy
is I think important for everyone but I
think there's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cases in
AI right there's a lot of AI where I'm
like that's a
basic automation script like that's not
AI it's not self- learning so I think
companies are scrambling to figure out
how they fit into this picture right how
do they use AI to disrupt because they
know if they don't figure it out someone
else is going to figure it out so just
like anything when you build when you go
through a massive bubble in a wave you
have 98% of the products created that
are absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and actually
create no value and then certain people
figure it out and win but I feel like
everyone feels the pressure to build AI
whether it's a a growth stage company
that wasn't AI first now they're like
all right what's our AI strategy how do
we make ourselves relevant and sexy and
create additional utility and then AI
first companies obviously I think are
well positioned here because like you're
building from scratch the right way
given absolute current technology but
what I found there's a there's a huge
Exodus of talent leaving Google deepmind
and Facebook's fair and Tesla autopilot
and like the top labs in the world
there's a lot of researchers leaving and
they want to find the next startup they
know this is the gold rush they know
this is the best time in human history
to start an AI company but they're just
looking for the right use case they're
right they looking for the right
industry to pursue with the right team a
lot of them are starting their own
companies but a lot of them are just
very selective and saying who are the
founders the teams and the use cases
that I can really buy into some people
want to build Foundation models some are
looking for vertical application uses
there's just so many different things
you can build in AI I've never worked
with more like 23-year-old Stanford phds
with multi hundred million dollar
valuations in my life so everyone is is
going we have Stanford professors right
that have only been academic professors
their whole life now starting companies
getting funded by top VCS so there's a
Gold Rush right now people are are
trying to find use cases and so it's
it's Uber competitive I'm really curious
who's actually going to come out on top
but I think kind of a Sidetrack here but
but I think there's a lot of people
trying to do Foundation models and it's
really hard to compete with open Ai and
anthropic and those but there's so many
amazing vertical application use cases
right if you want to disrupt insurance
or health care or whatever it may be but
you have some sort of Competitive Edge
in an industry where you just understand
it better than anyone and you can
acquire a lot of proprietary data and
then use existing models G GPT whatever
it may be to then become more
intelligent as a business so there's
it's it's I think that the Tailwind of
value creation happening right now is
crazy
exciting Chris I have a friend who's uh
at a series a company that's raised an
ungodly amount of money because of an AI
use case I think they actually do have
real utility in real business yeah she
had mentioned how insane it is with the
engineering Talent right now yeah and
specifically the compensation so she
described it as the wild west she
described it as every single one of
these Engineers has like an N of one
Market the the salaries and the equity
packages are absolutely crazy she also
mentioned that there's this like call it
uh ship jumping that's happening every
 
kind of going and acquiring these
lottery tickets but her take was really
interesting which is I'm not mad about
it like they're coming in and if these
people are actually really good they're
still providing a ton of value to our
company it's just the game that we're
current currently playing so can you
give our listeners a sense for what's
actually going on in the talent market
right now for engineers inside of these
AI companies absolutely I think sorry to
the VCS out there who love pave and
option impact but I'm sorry to say that
it completely falls short in this market
it is not the Benchmark you want to look
at especially in AI talent but we work
with hundreds of startups right most of
them we start with at seed in series a
and they're we work with 80% of the tier
one VCS from Sequoia index besser
andreon you name it so we have a pretty
good data pool we're talking to
thousands of candidates a month we have
I don't know probably 15 to 20 offers
going out every seven to 10 days and the
close rate's been harder than ever it's
insane but what I can say is this
there's different levels of talent if
you're building a foundation model and
you're needing somebody who's going to
create Cutting Edge intellectual
property that your Company Success lives
and dies on you have to go compete for
the best in the world and that is
insanely competitive if you're just
looking for an applied machine learning
engineer to commercialize a product with
some GPT rappers like it's still very
competitive but it's a different league
so there's just different levels of
talent out here we have startups that
are offering up to $800,000 base
salaries for head of AI right now seed
stage startups and we're trying to poach
from open Ai and anthropic and a lot of
these top firms and they're offering one
to2 million doll cash comp to pretty
much everyone it's it's pretty absurd
and so you have really inflated roles
but I would say on General basis for
standard ml engineer you're looking at a
 
engineering and then if you're looking
at AI researchers that is the most
competitive skill set I've seen in the
market right now and we have two-year
researchers with $400,000 and one to
two% offers at Sten series a companies
Chris what are these folks doing to
acquire these skills right a lot a lot
of these folks were not AI Engineers
four years ago right like what what are
how are they from like Stanford programs
or just top universities and research
labs and I don't quite often to see like
traditional backend Engineers or
something go into cutting a ji usually
these people come from Top research Labs
or top degrees where they got you know
they specialized in they specialized in
some form of artificial intelligence or
statistics or they had some sort of
deeper background there I don't really
see a lot of people retooling and
becoming these Cutting Edge researchers
if anything they might be on the applied
machine learning side but yeah they're
usually coming from the top top labs and
they're that's why they a lot of money
when you're looking at salary that's why
the pav and option impact absolutely
sucks for these because like it's not
about how many years of experience you
have it's what it's based on the Merit
of what you built and so if you had
someone who was a core contributor to
gpt3 two years ago that person can
command a million dollar salary plus
Equity almost anywhere right so it's
based on Merit and to your point earlier
yeah it is the wild west I mean you talk
about 12 to 18 month timelines and we we
have people jumping 30 days in right now
they're just getting monster offers
getting swooped away we just lost a few
people to elon's company xai we just
lost uh a couple guys that just accepted
head of AI roles to another companies it
is absolutely ridiculous and so what I
advise Founders to do is I'm like come
in hot show people you care give them
the equity and the comp they deserve
otherwise you might feel like you just
got a big win but they're gone in two
months because someone else come and
came and poached them and then also just
make sure they're truly bought into your
mission it's it's tougher to do that
when you're in AI though because a lot
of the AI companies aren't necessarily
Mission driven they're like all right
we're building a vector data base or
like oh we're building an AI agent for
salespeople and it's like it's cool but
it's like I don't know if it's going to
pull your heartstrings enough like if I
get a better offer from anthropic it's
like well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what do I do but yeah
it's ex it's the most competitive market
I've seen and everyone talks about that
but it genuinely is like our our hit
rates are probably 20 to 30% offer
acceptances they've got 10 to 15 offers
from the top companies and so we've had
to adjust our fee structure to allocate
bandwidth because these research roles
are just really really hard
that's you said something and I just
want to pull on real quick like and I'm
sure it's it's it's not black and white
obviously but like I I listen to all
these podcast Mark and dreon Etc talking
about Ai and how it's going to be great
for the world right like you mentioned
not really Mission driven maybe because
we're early on in the journey but that's
kind of the plight that at least I've
heard why AI is so great is to make the
world better yeah and better is a
spectrum I don't think it's black and
white right like if we can create an AI
sales agent for salespeople to to take
out 30 to 40% of their mundane tasks and
they can produce and create Better Lives
for their family and make more money
that is a net benefit for the world
right there are use cases that are
mission driven I think are really
compelling like health care for instance
we can actually use AI to predict
diseases effectively right zy
Therapeutics one of our clients they
just raised a billion dollars but
they're using it to create new drugs to
solve for massive diseases and so those
companies I think are really positioned
well from a recruiting perspective
because they have both elements but yeah
there's just so many AI companies and
every founder kind of goes to this thing
where like they're the hot chick against
the bar where they just think everyone's
gonna want to work at their company
right and it's like it's like dude I'm
sorry do you know how many people are
raising capital and have even more
impressive teams it's bananas and so we
have to kind of bring people down to
earth and say all right well you got a
great company we'll pit your story the
best we possibly can but like I just
want you to be aware of what what's out
there because we have to go in and we
can't just pretend like ah just because
you got XYZ on your cap table you're set
you
know Kelly the just to pull on your
mission Missi driven company thread like
I think there's just so many companies
who want to say that they're Mission
driven and it just turns out that they
have like great people that you you
trust that are really smart that you
enjoy working with and it's just like
we'll go solve whatever problem as long
as like that's around me I think this
whole like Mission driven thing in
Silicon Valley is like way oversold
especially like you know for these
Vector companies right Chris it's like
yeah like I'm not really like as long as
the people are dope I can learn from
them the problem like stimulates my
brain and like I'm getting paid really
well it kind of like checks off the
majority of my boxes and the things that
I optimize for now now granted there are
companies that are very Mission driven
you know stuff in like the health Tech
space and and things of that nature but
I think in general that's been one of
the big lies of Silicon Valley which is
like let's be Mission driven and it's
like well like you sell SAS software
that nobody gets a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about outside of
B2B Tech compies well that's kind of why
that's kind of why I brought it up I
mean I don't know if you heard the
sarcasm in my voice but like that's
that's why I brought it up because it's
like any other fad that comes up this is
going to save like it went we went
through it 20 years ago when I started
in Tech with you know whatever it was
then so I
just I I'm trying to I guess call a
little bit of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on this AI thing
and let's call it what it is it's a new
way of doing work and and and doing
business across all vectors all
Industries around the world to make a
difference in small ways right mundane
tasks and potentially big ways I don't
even think we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know yet like
let's be honest we're less than two
years in if you if you you know and
everyone's like we we know what's going
on you don't know like I can't wait 10
years from now I think we don't even
really know so I just wanted to kind of
unveil a little bit of BS on this whole
thing because every company's like we're
an AI company and it's like so yeah we
are in the top of the first inning and
and one of the things that Chris said
that I want to jump into is every
company now has to have an answer for AI
and like you know you're going to your
board meeting if you're not talking
about AI in the board meeting the board
meeting is like what is your strategy
here because like it's coming and
everyone's thinking about it so going
back to the talent layer Chris talk to
me about companies that are winning
right we talked about comp like that
obviously needs to be true and there's
like basically it's an N of one market
every time you're going after somebody
that has like a a deep ml background or
is working on foundational models but
what else are the the successful
companies doing outside of paying you a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money and raising a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton
of money from Top VCS it's a great
question we and we've seen that across
some of our more well-known companies
like character AI together AI who's
competing directly with open AI where
we're actually fairly consistently
beating open AI right and then we have
early stage companies that are pulling
off remarkable talent that you're like
how the hell did you land them across
the board I think there's patterns no
matter what stage you're at I think
number one is it's the interview
experience is a big thing like how how
how Elite is the team and how do they
make me feel do I have trust in this
team do I really Vibe with these people
you clearly have to have an amazing
vision and be able to articulate that
Vision like my my good friend Zeb Evans
at clickup he did a masterful job
jumping into a highly competitive space
everyone says why would you go compete
with aana in Monday it's such a crowded
space but he had three near-death
experiences and his last one really
taught him that we have a very finite
amount of time so he wanted to make
everything he did net positive and use
his time effectively to live the best
possible life and that was deeply dear
to his heart and he really evangelized
the mission and that vision and so I
think you got to be able to tell very
compelling Vision you gotta obviously
have good investors and a good backing
but you got to be able to tell a story
and back it up with real data real
traction you got to be able to sell like
the CEO I think is really really
important because there's a thousand
great companies you can join I think
Talent density is a really important
thing these really smart people that are
absolute game changers they're assessing
the team at the early stage you don't
have unit economics to flaw back on you
can talk about your Tam and all these
Market things that everyone loves to
harp on but like at the end of the day
you don't really even know your market
yet and so so you don't even know what
Market you could create and so it's
really about the team and the vision and
the energy and so I'm a huge proponent
of Founders just building super Elite
teams early on I think that having
talent magnets on board early make every
subsequent hire much easier so what a
lot of a lot of Founders want to chump
out on their early hires because they
want to preserve oneway and just get the
MVP I get the logic but when you're
competing in a space like AI you need to
go big like let's get a big name a
killer in there and then allow that
person to help attract the the talent
the team you build is the company you
build like reeno famous for saying that
when I look at some of the best Founders
whether it was Travis KCK his first
seven hires at Cloud kitchens were all
L7 Engineers from like Google and
Facebook the top top Engineers right
gome bardine the founder of ways we
helped build his founding team in his
last company it was all L Sev right just
supremely Savant Engineers you look at
David Marcus over at lightspark he was
the president of PayPal built Novi at
Facebook his team lightspark which we
also help build a good amount of they're
all the top top end Engineers you got
the CMO from um Robin Hood I mean an
elite team right that still had that
startup mindset when you can build an
elite team tell a compelling story and
you have great investors behind you you
can convince people of things but you
have to convince people after you've
convinced other impressive people to
join because then you're like hey he
joined what does he see that you're not
seeing right now because let me there's
something you like if there there's this
confirmation bias when other impressive
people are part of that Journey that I
think is is
underlooked hey everyone we'll be right

here's a crazy stat between hybrid and
Frontline employees about 80% don't
typically work in an office so it's no
surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun
that's where work Vio zoom's employee
experience platform comes in if you've
ever recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive
accessible and mobile First Tool people
actually like using it which is why
companies like ryion a Dollar General
virgin and more have rolled it out to
hundreds of thousands thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shoutouts and live streams among
other features help Elevate the employee
experience like never before the result
dramatically better retention
productivity and most importantly
connectedness a greater sense of the
belonging we all crave at work whether
we sit at a desk or drive a truck make
work Vivo the digital heart of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR Heretics
 
s they're the temp PES and you said
magnets I love I love the idea of talent
magnets I thought about it the exact
same way and it's it's really the only
way as an early stage company that you
can compete is like you know ideas are
cheap execution is everything well who's
going to be doing the execution it's the
people and so if you don't have great
people I mean it's going to really hard
to win now I would say that there's you
know we're we're talk we're having this
conversation on June 18th I think it was
like Friday of last week that Alexander
Wang's post came out from scale around
hiring based on marit and so my sense is
is that this is not like a new thing in
in early stage Tech I think this has
just been the thing for the last couple
of years but I think what Chris what
opponents would say to what you just
said is just like well how are we
thinking about diversity like how are we
thinking about bringing in people that
look different than us that have
different ideas than us and how do we
not repeat the mistakes of the last you
know 15 20 years in Tech to where all of
a sudden you look around a room and it's
all men that are white or Asian like
what's your take on that so interesting
cuz I was I was going to we didn't
script this ask the same question cuz
I'm even hearing in this conversation a
lot of male names a lot of he and I've
been seeing it AI Talent AI like where
are all the women Chris like what are
you seeing out there like actually have
a a number of female founder like
pabs Demi just raised an 80 million
series B they're crushing it Sarah over
at trunk tools Eric Schmid rer I mean
there's there we work with a number of
of companies founded by females too I
think the whole diversity conversation
is interesting and I'm pretty strongly
opinion on I think the Mei right the the
Merit excellence and intelligence I
think that is the foundation of how all
great companies have been built I think
we just deviated so far from the with
the woke movement for me diversity is
not about appointing a woman or a person
of color into a particular role it is
about who's the best person for the job
it's about diversity of experience
diversity of opinions diversity of
mindset right diversity of personality
traits right I think you need a diverse
set of personality traits to build a
successful company you can't hire people
that are all high drivers you know
hardcore you need some intellectuals
that are more numbers driven you need
people that are more strategic and more
collaborative like you need different
personality types on companies and I I
think diversity for me Isn't these these
metrics or or things that the narrative
was trying to tell us I feel like
there's a at the early stage level you
don't have the luxury of saying no we
can't hire that person because they
don't meet a demographic requirement it
will kill you right you you're competing
against the best of the best in
competition and capitalism it's about
the best person wins and I think Merit
is critical to that like you have to
hire the best people for the job you
have to be aware of biases I think
that's important otherwise I think the
consequence of that is you're G to reap
what you sow if you hire a company of 50
guys at some point there is going to be
a female that would have been the best
person for that job that could have been
a game changer that you will miss out on
and you will pay the consequence of that
so it's it's important to be intentional
about how you're creating your company
the collective energy of it I just don't
feel like it's it's worth getting overly
focused about having perfect headcount
and just trying to handpick different
genders and races I feel like it gets so
discombobulated like we have a mission
we want to attract certain people to
that mission we have to be cognizant but
we can't make that the primary thing
like it's just going to take the focus
off the
ball I agree and I have a hypothesis
that it's it actually starts
earlier than that I.E a lot of that
stuff can be avoided without even having
to explicitly or intentionally think
about it if you open the consideration
set of where you're looking right it's
like this whole referral thing like
people if you go to the same person
they're going to refer a lot of people
that look like them usually right so I'd
love your your both of your reactions on
that as you know recruitment but like I
always had a hypothesis that like open
up many funnels the intentional of where
you look and naturally you'll
find you know theoretically many people
that could be a fit for the job that all
look different and have different
experiences yeah we're going to do we're
going to do a segment on this Kelly so
it's you know I think the the scale post
is opening up this discussion again
which when I first saw it I was like I I
mean we saw coinbase do this four years
ago and I think coinbase actually did it
better than you know no no disrespect to
Alex but I think the thing I didn't
consider when I first read it was
how many people haven't said anything
that actually feel a certain way that
are still scared by the cancel culture
and the retribution aspect of coming out
and taking a stance that is Merit based
my take on diversity is it's it's going
to change we are not going to just look
at immutable traits anymore like race
and gender like I think those are
important like it is important to make
sure everybody feels comfortable working
inside of a company
but you know I I think uh you know I
posted about it this morning on LinkedIn
and Colleen mccre for of the show uh
came on and said well how are they
defining it and you know my my point was
like it's kind of like democracy like
Merit defining Merit is kind of like
democracy like it's ugly but it's like
the best version of what we have today
and so we should be trying to improve it
versus if I take the other side like we
know how diversity has been defined for
the last 10 to 15 years which is how
many women and how many people of color
do you have in the building not how
excellent are those people or like how
do we know we're getting different ideas
and that's what I think is going to
change as we think about the next 10 to
 
tumultuous you know zone right now kind
of like our politics and our democracy
to where I I I don't know how it's going
to get on the other side but I see like
I see a better Utopia in the future than
what we have just exited in the past
yeah I think we're correcting like and
whenever we print too much money we see
a massive drought in the economy after
right whenever we go way too far left
and it gets out of hand you're gonna see
a massive course correction so much so
that you're having major investors in
Silicon Valley now come out with their
support for Trump doing Trump
fundraisers right you have people that
would be crucified for saying the
Republican or voting for a republican
now doing so now you have people like
Alex where it's somehow it's big news
when he talks about building a company
on principles that have been used for
Generations that only recently were
deteriorated because we had to you know
we had to we had to completely change
the way we spoke about things to to
Pander to certain people look I I think
you got to be kind of Hardcore to build
companies and I think that the if we
want to maintain our position as a world
superpower I mean Empires usually last
about 250 years we're in year 248 I
think if we're going to thrive as an
American country and stay at the top of
our game we have to prioritize
Innovation and being at the top of the
economic curve and encourage people to
build and celebrate the hardcore
Builders not constantly talk about
mental health and work life balance and
diversity I understand there's
importance there but I think we went way
overboard and we forgot what made
America great and what continues to do
it it's it's hard work it's people with
Big Dreams it's people that have insane
perseverance and those people just don't
want to deal with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they want to
build great things for the world yeah
but like can't all those things be true
like I don't want to you know but but
like I feel like there's a lot of
there's a lot of ways to get to the
right answer and I think we all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
it up whether it's mental health or
diversity and we got to a terrible place
and then we put in maybe swung the
pendulum over rotated put in unnatural
rules and acts to fix it yeah but if we
would have done the right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] early and
often and consistent it's like working
out it's like do you eat your vegetables
and work out every day for two years or
or do you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up and go get whatever
it is now what is it called goie the
pills like the
o yeah AIC yeah so like I I just feel
like it's still the right answer you
guys it's just we just took I think
tried to take a shortcut path that
didn't feel good that was a little bit
unnatural I still think it's the right
answer but let's do it in in better ways
to get there is my is my take I I agree
how the how is you know just just like
said I just said the how was not working
no but I'm agreeing with you but what
I'm saying Kelly is is like I think it's
it's really easy for people to to point
poke poke holes into the the Merit
Excellence intelligence post and say
well how where's the rubric and you know
look like I don't like to take strong
man arguments but this is a perfect
example of like well how do we do
Dei like I I don't I haven't seen it
done well and there has been billions of
dollars invested into that idea for the
last 10 years and it we've come out into
this world to where it's like well we
don't like Merit anymore that's kind of
where the whole thing landed and again I
don't I don't want to take a straw man
and I I think I think most people do not
feel that way but that that has what has
happened at the broad sense do do you
see what happens now Chris you see what
this is all
about yeah no these are controversial
things and they're real but was it
Google or Facebook one of the the head
of Dei was embezzling money from the
company it that was Facebook that was
Facebook and it's just like so many
prominent VCS and Founders like hey if
you want to run a better company and
produce better results just fire your
Dei committee immediately and so I think
the way it was done wasn't right I think
the premise of it makes sense but
obviously I think it just got infested
with this woke virus to be very blunt
but to your point I think I think we can
be more Mindful and and more attentive
to it nuanced and nuanced like it's it's
going to require more Nuance like
startups are hardcore and it's not it is
a war and so like I think it's not for
everyone I think as companies get bigger
you want to make everybody happy and I
totally understand the draw towards that
but I think bottom line you have to be a
Savage to win as a startup so you got to
focus on winning and doing it with your
team and you know that's that's my just
core thesis is like the more time
Founders spent on that stuff the more
distracted they are and like I just
think you got to go build a great
product and that's why Brian Armstrong
and many other Founders like no politics
at work none of this like we've got a
mission and we don't want distractions
and I think that's what we've seen a lot
of a lot of distractions and we got to
get back to building because I I'm more
concerned with the fate of America right
like I don't want to be overtaken by
China and all these competitors because
we're slowing down Innovation we're
softening as a culture we do need hard
people that can solve hard problems and
have grit and perseverance to stay on
top hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
Real Talk most Talent leaders haven't
yet cracked how to leverage AI for
Meaningful impact on their hiring
processes and business goals but the
leaders who are effective using AI to
transform their recruiting team's
efficiency and quality use metaview
metaview is the AI assistant for the
interview process their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed that means
your people can focus on creating human
connections with candidates during calls
and save time on the busy work of
cleaning up notes after every interview
but it's so much more than just a time
saer because perfect notes means perfect
data for every candidate in every
pipeline hiring teams can make confident
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process join forward-thinking

I think the last thing I'll say in this
and we'll transition topics but this
this conversation is important I know a
lot of our listeners may not be used to
having and and hearing this type of
conversation and it's one perspective
and we'll bring on many different sorts
of perspectives but the thing that as I
think about on June 18 2024 that gives
me a lot of optimism is we're now
allowed to have the conversation yeah
and if I go back three years this four
years this was not a conversation we
were allowed to have and so whether or
not you agree or you disagree it's okay
it's just be open to hearing what other
people have to say that don't agree with
you and I think if we did that as a
culture and we we we leaned into that
especially in Tech that is where magic
and diversity comes from is when people
who you don't don't agree with you can
listen to you can find common ground
with and you can keep moving forward
with as a community and that's what I
get really excited about that's where my
optimism lies so I will jump off my
because guess what like people have
always disagreed forever like people
have always disagreed and they always
will so like you can't just work or hang
out with the people that you only like
or you only agree with I mean you can
but it's just not it's not realistic
especially in business you know I mean
Nolan and I don't always like each other
or agree and no we do like each other we
don't always agree but we do like each
other is what I'll say unless unless
there's something you're not me and then
I a little insecure no no no no no no
look if we're gonna move past our
differences we have to be unified by
stronger values than those differences
right and so if you're in a company that
core value could be Excellence like
we're here to do the best work and
create a product or a service that
really changes the world and you're more
you care more about that than are uing
over your political differences right if
you're in relationships it's like you
there's there's deeper bonds than there
are differences you have to make the
bonds stronger than the walls right so
we're gonna have things we disagree on
but as long as we keep the fabric of
those relationships and what's important
at the Forefront it all that stuff
doesn't matter
totally can I pivot to a question or are
we still yeah please please I think I'm
almost sweating after that but like that
was great we'll fire it up so like the
we talked about the AI Talent Chris AI
Talent comp Etc I'm curious about
Executives in AI as far as like you all
as a recruiting agency your placing AI
exx I mean if we're only 18 two years 18
months two years into this phenomenon I
have to believe there's not a huge
supply of AI execs who kind of done this
or whatnot so who are you placing who
are you finding what are kind of like
the
musthave criteria for those execs and
what's more of a nice to have so is
pretty broad right there's so many use
cases you have companies that are
building like search and recommendation
products right and so you pull those
folks you have people that are building
like text to voice and voice to text and
text to video right looking for
multimodal people you have core models
right looking for Transformer diffusion
experience there's there's so many
different subsets of AI right and
there's different levels of scarcity
depending on which roles there are some
some of these video companies that are
doing animations they want Nerf
researchers and it feels like there's
only a couple hundred these people that
exist in the world there's just some
really really Niche roles out there so
there's different use cases if you're
looking for like heads of research to
come build Foundation models for use
there's very there's a those are very
hard to find you're gon to pull from Top
research Labs or top startups that are
already building their own models if
you're looking for more of the applied
side right where it's like hey we
already we're not trying to do anything
new from a research perspective the
existing technology works but we want to
build an application around this using
llms to commercialize a new product
right it's pretty rare to find people
that have already built successful
commercial llm products right so you're
wi you have a small subset of companies
that you can poach from some of the
bigger companies had already applied
that in commercialized products but
there's a lot of startups being launched
like the Harvey of the world or the
Jaspers or the writers whatever it may
be um and so you kind of just got to
know your do your homework and figure
out who's actually successfully launched
llm based applications so it really
really varies but in
general in general we're poaching out of
top Labs we're poaching out of uh top
startups both on the applied and the
research side and then I think the
interesting thing too executive AI
search is very different than
traditional exec search and the reason I
say that is if you look at a CTO at a
series B or C company they want someone
who can scale an organization to 50 to
 
hit 100 200 million are you're looking
for a smart technologist and business
strategist but you're looking for
someone who's really good at managing
people and process and ORS with AI you
just don't need a big team and so a lot
of our executive searches these these
people that are getting Chief AI officer
titles in massive comps much higher than
any CTO we place they're managing five
to 15 person teams and so they don't
really need the executive level
operations in scale that traditional
execs need but they have to be the
smartest person in the room and bring a
lot of credibility right so they're more
Merit based technical Excellence yeah
technical intellectual Excellence so the
smartest leaders that have the most pull
and pedigree to them that are smart and
can just rally small teams that's more
what the exec look like so it's it's
kind of a hybrid between an individual
contributor and an executive level
search because you're you're you're
poaching researchers for head ofy jobs
that have maybe never even managed
before because they have the network and
they know what they're doing and they
have the strategy and so there's a bit
difference uh in those exec
profiles interesting I I want to talk
about the candidate side so you know you
have this really interesting purview
into candidates on one side as you
mentioned earlier who have like 15 to 20
offers and obviously there's like a
technical aspect there and there's a
supply and demand problem then on the
other side I'm sure you have candidates
who aren't getting
offers and the the thing I want to hear
from you Chris is like what advice do
you give to candidates to help them
become more
marketable and you know specifically
given the the aperture that you have
what are the best people doing that we
can all learn from that's a very
interesting
question it's very
interesting it's hard to give
non-general advice there because you
kind of have to coach on the court
versus like give blanket advice of like
hey just be better at coding but I think
I think communication actually is a big
thing I think a lot of especially we're
doing ahead of AI search right now and
 
communication alone and so I can't help
someone be a better programmer they're
gonna have to figure that out themselves
but communication is critical especially
when you're tasked with owning a big
project or a big product you have to be
excellent communicating and so I would
advise those candidates to actually
spend time articulating what it is they
want what it is their good at understand
hey what are the products and systems
you've built to date and actually be
able to speak to those in depth and and
listen to questions and actually give
responses that are appropriate for that
question you got some people that ramble
for five minutes when they're asked to
 
emotional intelligence to say what is
this person asking can I answer this
quickly and sustin because you don't
have time to ramble on these things a
lot of it is just around communication
is know how to tell your story come in
with passion do your research on the
companies you're interviewing for and
actually come with thoughtful questions
so it shows that you're engaged know
your own career history and what you've
done so you can speak to your
accomplishments in depth make sure your
code's good but at the end of the day
it's communication and it's if you
haven't thought about certain questions
that are fairly obvious it might take
you 10 minutes to answer them but if you
thought about it and you know you're
going to be asked about systems
architecture or you know you're going to
be asked about what model you built you
should understand the bullet points in
advance so you can rattle off and sound
like a genius I think a lot of it it
comes down to communication
yeah so so you disqualified 80% of a
pipeline because they fell short on
communicating well with other humans
absolutely that's very
interesting it makes total sense to me
right Kelly like we know we want to talk
about soft skills and you know that's
that's actually I I hear it I I'll just
give you a little bit slight of a Nuance
on that Chris which is in the the two
ways that I think about communication
which is one verbal and the other
written and you know there's obviously
verbal aspect of like how are we
interacting when you're on the spot and
like feeling like a little hot during an
interview but then there's this other
aspect after you've had time to reflect
and and this is the biggest piece of
advice I give friends is if you go into
an interview and you have a conversation
with somebody and if it went well or it
didn't go well it doesn't matter what
you do after matters and like I see
people who are like oh my God I blew an
interview and I'm like great what what
what you send your follow-up
email I didn't send a follow-up email
I'm like well that's that's a missed
opportunity and so I I totally agree
with you and I think like this is going
back to the earlier conversation of like
oh AI is taking over and fewer people
are having jobs Sam Altman just said
this he's most concerned for the math
people the the the the the written word
and the the spoken word people he has a
ton of confidence in that are always
going to be employable because they
interact with others as well that is
spoton and it's such this kind of like
reverberation effect where AI is going
to start displacing people and I think
he or mark andreon one of them said that
he sees a huge opportunity in the next
decade in in-person highly human
connected events like anything that
facilitates human connection because
we're going to stray further and further
away from it we're gonna
be robots are G to be such such a big
part of our society and AI that human
connection learning emotional
intelligence how to connect and interact
with people effectively like robots
can't do that and so AI can't do that
and so yeah it's a very interesting
thought and I totally agree and that's
why high level salespeople they're not
going to be displaced if you look at law
firms the associates they'll be
displaced Partners who need the trust
and relationships they need someone to
call at 4 in the morning when everything
goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you cannot put that on a
robot or some sort of artificial
intelligence like that comes down to
human to human trust and connection and
so you should you should know that you
have to invest in build in great
relationships and people can't replace
that right so it's counterintuitive to
an extent yeah it just it just scared me
that that that fun fact you know that
that these folks are going to be kind of
running the world if you think about AI
taking over all those things they have
very small teams they're taking away
people's jobs and they can't talk to
other people so I just like I think we
have to make sure that that with this
very lots of power and responsibility
comes that EQ and judgment because that
that definitely scared the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I
think that that's there's going to be a
huge premium on that moving forward it's
gonna because there's going to be more
candidates available for jobs we've seen
it for the last two years and the the
technical differences there's a big one
right now just with like ML and like we
don't have enough ml Engineers but
that's going to the market always finds
an equilibrium and then the thing that's
going to be the determining factor is
your EQ is how you interact with others
is how you communicate so I I love to
hear that Chris that gives me even more
optimism about the future that we're
going to build Kelly anything else from
you I just a quick quick tidbit anything
else on other Industries I mean we love
AI but you you you see a lot of things
Chris any other Trends or things going
on either by function or industry yeah I
mean I like to follow the capital
capital is usually an interesting
indicator of where things are headed and
I follow the talent right like I'm
trying to recruit for crypto companies
right now all these different companies
deep Tech I can kind of see where the
smartest people are going right and I
think Talent is a good indication of
where to be optimistic which is why I'm
still Uber optimistic on crypto for
instance we're still hiring ridiculously
talented people in crypto companies
right now even in this bare Market I
think deep Tech is having its Heyday
right now I think this is the time where
investors are like all right we're
looking at 20y year time Horizons
generational companies like space
companies like vaa you've got uh figure
doing humanoid robots
I think Brad adcock's doing some really
cool stuff but I think deep Tech
robotics space Tech I think space is
going to be a huge sector in the next 10
years I mean it's remarkable the
advancements we're going there with Elon
and the Falcon X and how it's Uber cheap
to send Rockets back to and from space
now so we can do it's incredible so I
think space Tech is gonna have a big run
I think chip manufacturing is g to be
big I think our Reliance in Taiwan and
having 70 plus perc of the chips in
Taiwan and we have the looming threat
with China there we're starting to build
facilities in the US I think chips are
going to be big and I think gpus I think
the most expensive commodity that we're
all everyone's got their eye on is GPU
we need we need more we need more chips
we need more power for for AI and I
think just became the most valuable
company in the world right it's pretty
insane but we just don't have enough
compute to support the amount of AI
companies in scale that we're seeing
right now so I think compute is going to
be a huge opportunity
so because of this trend with AI and
every you know everything else going on
I think we're going to see a rapid
explosion of a lot of Industries biotech
is booming I've seen so many companies
do Billion Dollar Plus rounds because
from what I understand it takes about
$200 million do to commercialize a drug
right so one of our clients just raised
 
million for GPU and then they're doing
four drugs in parallel $200 million each
and so I think there's going to be
massive breakthroughs in the
pharmaceutical industry
and so I think we'll see in real estate
Pharma healthare whatever it may be
because of the AI applications I think
we're going to be I think this is the
most exciting technological way we've
ever seen and I'm optimistic it's gonna
be a freaking long bull market I love it
Chris you know just the last thing for
the audience and and I think people
should really anchor on what you just
said because the some of my most
successful friends and people that I
aspired to be like they picked winners
and we don't talk enough about picking
winners in your career and so as people
right now are either on the market or
thinking about their next move or
wondering about like what's next for
them I think they should really hone in
on what you just said because picking
winners if you pick a winner and you're
at the right place at the right time not
only can It just be great for your life
it can be amazing for your career and
your future career opportunities so
thank you so much for the time it's been
super helpful we really appreciate it
well well well s Chris appreciate it
