recently with the government it's about
 
recently with the government it's about
 
are now tied to government in some way
 
are now tied to government in some way
or another like if you're at Boeing and
 
or another like if you're at Boeing and

missiles even but like state governments
 
missiles even but like state governments
are getting bigger local governments are
 
are getting bigger local governments are
getting bigger and and my take on it as
 
getting bigger and and my take on it as
I've been thinking about it for the last
 
I've been thinking about it for the last
couple of weeks is I think it's because
 
couple of weeks is I think it's because
of safety and because we don't know
 
of safety and because we don't know
what's on the other side of not having
 
what's on the other side of not having
this job anymore Peterson what's your
 
this job anymore Peterson what's your
take on that I I love that bringing this
 
take on that I I love that bringing this
up uh this is the the the whole issue
 
up uh this is the the the whole issue
with connectivity is that you can't
 
with connectivity is that you can't
connect with somebody unless you trust
 
connect with somebody unless you trust
them and that trust is fundamentally a
 
them and that trust is fundamentally a
driver of safety our brains are wired
