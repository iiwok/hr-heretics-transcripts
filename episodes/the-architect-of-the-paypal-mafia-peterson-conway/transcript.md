# The Architect of the Paypal Mafia: Peterson Conway

## Transcript

 
Peter taught me a question very early on
and I use it in I I do 12 to 15 calls A
Day 2000 uh 70 to 80 calls a week and
 
question every single time and that is
uh you know I usually send them an email
and I asked them any surprises it
doesn't matter if they've just had an
interview if I've known the person for
years and they've just come out of an
interview or I've sent them into the big
boss's office any
surprises and
it is a binary answer if they come out
and say no you know that this is a
person that is not curious that isn't an
optimist because anyone that that meets
anything for the first time will always
find something surprising it doesn't
matter if you're meeting the garbage man
out front like you can find something
beautiful and interesting and surprising
in any business any bad idea any failed
founder
and think about that for a second if
you're you know if you're taking 2,000
meetings a year for 20 years as Kevin
still does as Joe Londale still does I
think you have to be an optimist like
you have to be constantly learning I
think that these are tremendously
Dynamic people that continually evolve
and learn they've had to put up with my
Antics and and uh you know my my
eccentricities I think it's because
they're they're they're curious and
valuable themselves what stands up to
you what else have you learned
specifically from Peter
teal well this may get me in

trouble all right welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics today we
have an amazing guest we have Peterson
Conway on with us uh Peterson's
background is quite interesting he was
at zoom in the early days that's Zoom
with an X like now we're using Zoom with
the Z uh and you could tell it's like
two generations removed because it's
like the same name just spelled
differently um but what was interesting
about that company is it was acquired by
PayPal and this is in the days of the
PayPal Mafia and Peterson has worked
very closely with people like Peter teal
and Joe Lonsdale and many of the PayPal
Mafia he's been at Founders fund he
helped construct the early paler team
and so Peterson I'm so excited to have
you on today thanks for joining us thank
you for having him big consumer of your
material here love it all right let's
talk about your early career so I kind
of gave the lead in of like you ended up
at Zoom which was acquired by PayPal how
did that come about like tell us about
that story and what happened there well
if anyone is familiar with the the Peter
sers movie being there uh where this
Gardener kind of constantly chansy the
garden wanders in uh to you know various
you know Mansions the presidential Oval
Office and he's a complete idiot but uh
he seems blessed with good luck and uh
he ends up you know dispensing uh you
know massive economic advice and you
know all of these things and taken for a
real genius and uh you know that's my
nickname at ABC uh is
chansy that's
incredible but I'll give you the quick
answer because it's a good one uh I got
lucky I you know as was a Humanities
major uh barely got through Dartmouth
flunked my only CS class there and uh
had this idea that I wanted to you know
very liberal arts romantic idea that I
wanted to work in a off in a warehouse
where I could ride my motorcycle into it
and uh I had tried going into Investment
Banking uh Peter teal has a lot of
theories about you know if you're really
smart uh you have but three choices you
go into medicine you know if you're
really smart but you don't have any
technical capacity you go into medicine
you go into law or you go into to
Banking and uh I was a terrible Banker
but uh you know sitting at home after
two years of that uh day trading my 401k
which is awful way to make a living and
uh I got this idea in my head and I
jumped on my motorcycle and I rode South
of Market and I found the first open
door and I literally rode my motorcycle
in there and lo and behold was Kevin
Harts and uh Keith her boy and David
Sachs and they were literally in a
meeting if I recall and they were
building you know PayPal was a thing uh
it was the dominant pay payments
platform out there they had yet uh to
take it public or sell it and uh they
were just building applications on top
of those and those would become
Eventbrite those would become zoom and I
got lucky rolled in there they thought I
was nuts I later brought an Airstream
later brought my dogs and I gu think I
think I was just kept around because I
was weird and I just did anything to
make myself useful Peterson I have to
ask this like you didn't know these
people before you did this in fact when
I met Kevin you didn't know they were be
there no when I met Kevin literally he
said uh you know we work with Peter Tila
and I said who's that I had no idea I I
just want to unpack this for two minutes
because I'm an HR freak and I just sound
like a security risk like well I just
want to know what it what it takes like
what is going through someone's mind and
body to get on a cycle and right up
Market Street and just go into a random
Warehouse like what what was that moment
where you were like I'm gonna get my key
or wh however you start your bike and
I'm gonna go into this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Warehouse
I don't even know if anyone well that's
what happens when you're day trading
your for and K at home you become a
little nutty oh you go Looney okay and
this is what's happening to all of us by
the way in in a hybrid and work remote
environment we're just becoming a little
nutty yeah that's what DHA said on our
episode Nolan and I agree
I literally found I found a rollup door
there was a nice security guard outside
there was a ramp cuz he was unloading uh
there was like a an antique thing and
they had the next story and so they had
a ramp for teing heavy objects and I
just thought it would be funny if I rode
my ramp right up there and that guy
later became a friend U but you know he
said well let me take you around you
seem like you'd fit right in here with
all these Misfits holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay so so
you show up and then
you you somehow start like recruiting
people is what I can ascertain from your
LinkedIn profile kind of uh yeah I I
like I said I was a Humanities major and
I just started bringing coffee lunch
Indian food motorcycles surfboards
airstreams anything I could and I had a
tiny little bit of money uh I think my
 
put it all on Kevin so Kevin was
building uh then what was called Molly
guard and they were just a bunch of
different products on top of PayPal just
trading on their money
licensing flagrantly and illegally by
the way uh and he had a the men's
bathroom was papered in uh cease and
desist letters from from uh States uh
various US states telling them to stop
and and we proceeded and and I basically
um got into this role for Kevin of
opening up really hard to reach doors
because as a Humanities major like to
write so I wrote oldfashioned letters
put them in a FedEx envelope sent them
off and we get a meeting with uh you
know the largest bank in India and I
jump on a plane and go to India and and
open up a distribution uh relationship
for zoom and then go on to the the next
one in in the Philippines and just
repeat I I'm just I'm trying to you know
have this sink in I mean you know a lot
of people talk about and you've alluded
to this in some AR like the magic of
silicon and the dream and all these
things I mean that story I mean it is
that magic like like this things don't
happen they do
happen I agre with you you I I think
good things happen to good people yeah
you know I think um you know you may not
like this on your on on your podcast but
um the smartest the best looking the
richest are not the ones that always win
it's it's the most affable often yeah no
we like that on our podcast that is that
is well said that is that is really well
said and for our audience if you don't
know Kevin Harts was not only the
co-founder of Zoom with an x uh also a
venture partner at Founders fund but
most importantly what you probably know
him as is the co-founder of
Eventbrite and much more there's a great
backstory real quick to Kevin uh so
Kevin was head of the democratic student
body at Stanford and Peter teal famously
was anything but and so they were almost
uh you know Arch Rivals but I you know
Kevin uh at SGI had also a little uh you
know beer and Chip money pile and he
started putting everything he had into
anything Peter did and they eventually
became friends and now of course the
rest is history but Kevin went on to
invest in PayPal paler uh Airbnb
Pinterest Oculus andrel I mean the guy
is a generational
investor so cool okay so you have
supported
Legends in Silicon Valley and want to
talk a little bit about about it because
some of these people like Peter like
Keith like Joe Lonsdale are known to be
brutal to work with and you've been
working with them for now two decades
going on two decades plus how have you
survived
that my wife would like to know this the
answer to that as well
um I I think the most important thing I
would share on that uh is loyalty
it's it's a it's not a Silicon Valley uh
value and they have seen me through hard
things uh and I have stuck with them
when I you know Kevin Harts famously put
a trash can on my
head can you elaborate on that story
please uh yes he he didn't like my
performance he stuck me actually in his
office and monitored my phone calls and
at one point didn't like the the it was
the sheer volume I just wasn't wasn't
making enough calls and he literally
walked over picked up the trash can
filled with food and let placed it on my
head holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and later later had that
story got out and uh and in due
diligence for for Eventbrite uh I got
approached to explain that story I was
gonna say a little hostile work
environment I'm not sure here we've all
we've all we've all grown up and frankly
I deserved it yeah it's an interesting
point that you say that we've all grown
up because one of the things that I've
learned is that people change
and people do grow up and especially
like when you're early in your career uh
I haven't heard anything that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
crazy candidly uh in my career but like
you know people are
emotional yeah and they grow past that
but H how have you like how have you
survived through this you know I think
that um they have been um they found me
a curiosity and in the beginning and
later I had a singular you know Peter
teal has a theory that in starting a
company everybody wants to do everybody
else's job and this is the problem with
generalist you know they say
specialization is for in insects when
you're starting a company and you're 10
people uh everybody has to be you know
profoundly focused on what they're good
at and I was lucky to have just one
skill and that was a needle that bounced
when I was close to good
people and I think that you know riding
by motorcycle up that ramp and into that
warehouse I'll take full credit for that
I'll take full credit for seeing that
Kevin was an unusual guy uh and you know
that's the one TR skill set I've traded
on my whole life you know I want to be
Rider I'm wnab be pilot I'm a terrible
father and farmer but I I I'm a very
good judge of of
character yeah Peterson we talk a lot on
this show about you know difficult
leaders difficult Founders and and how
to work with them sometimes survive them
but also to like change them and
influence them and be a force in that
Evolution I'm just curious how and if
you've played that role with them over
the years and you know some advice or
how how you did that i i people another
way to frame that question is like what
is the winning question when you're
meeting somebody and I'll get to you'll
see where this is going um but Peter
taught me a question very early on and I
use it and I I do um 12 to 15 calls a
day 2,000 uh 70 to 80 calls a week and
 
that question every single time and that
is uh you know I usually send them an
email and and uh in advance and I asked
them any surprises it doesn't matter if
they've just had an interview if I've
known the person for years and they've
just come out of an interview or I've
sent them into the big boss's office any
surprises and
it is a binary answer if they come out
and say no you know that this is a
person that is not curious that isn't an
optimist because anyone that that meets
anything for the first time will always
find something surprising it doesn't
matter if you're meeting the garbage man
out front like you can find something
beautiful and interesting and surprising
in any business any bad idea any failed
founder
and think about that first second if
you're you know if you're taking 2,000
meetings a year for 20 years as Kevin
still does uh as Joe laale still does I
think you have to be an optimist like
you have to be constantly learning and
and so to answer your question
specifically like I think that these
that these are tremendously Dynamic
people that continually evolve and
learn so providing you know the fact
that they've had to put up with my
Antics and and and uh you know my my
eccentricities I think it's because
they're they're they're curious and
malleable themselves yeah I don't know
what it's like to be their accountant
you know because I bet you they're not
very curious there but when it comes to
people you got to be curious maybe
there's some surprises though you know
yeah I I want to pull the thread of you
know
Peter I've heard Keith talk about Peter
a lot and a lot about um you know
Keith's learnings and interview
questions what stands out to you what
else have you learned specifically from
Peter
teal well this may get me in trouble uh
but the the first thing you're hit with
with Peter is almost this tormented
intelligence when we uh remember when uh
the uh sitcom or whatever it was Silicon
Valley came out and I was so excited
because you know I was down to seeing
Peter about once a year at the Christmas
party sort of thing this wasn't that
long ago I guess and uh and I went up to
Peter all eager and there were a bunch
of us all eager there that he was at the
Christmas party and I said Peter what
did you think about your portray how you
were portrayed in Silicon Valley and he
stopped and he looked up at like into
the corner like autistically in this
horribly
long silence and I was terrified that I
had asked him this question because I
thought for sure he was going to lay me
flat for like the differences between
communism and Marxism some profound
answer and he goes well for starters I
would never drive a car that
[Laughter]
small wow I have no idea what your
question was but that's my favorite
Peter teal story uh so I love that story
I want to know what what else did you
learn from him well you know I
think everybody's write his book 0 to
one or it's on all of our shelves and I
think everybody should go back and read
that book I think it's a foundational
text
uh uh for for the new economy um but
also frankly for being a good human
being you know Peter taught me really
early on um to to look for those um
people that really just didn't weren't
managing to be popular uh that were
naturally curious that were um thinking
about things on a massive uh scale and
um then I'll teach you one little thing
that he taught me that I thought was
very interesting he said never manage a
zero
inbox he said you know there are two
types of people in the world and he
loves these two types of people he had
these theories about people that live on
ridges versus people that live in The
Valleys um but he said you know there's
two types of managers those that manage
a zero inbox and those that don't and I
said what's not to would you love to
have someone running your company that
is that tight that is like getting their
inmail their mailbox down to zero he
goes no that's being reactive that's
letting somebody else tell you how
you're going to spend your day and very
interestingly when you look at Joe
lonsdale's schedule or Kevin Hart's
schedule there are these huge blocks
that are not scheduled every day when
they walk into the office because these
these people walk in and think about
what is the most important thing I need
to get done today and get that person on
the phone and that's what I do for a
living Peterson what what wasn't he good
at what did you see or what did he admit
that in the early days keev yeah in the
early days Joe Kevin Peter I this is
unfair of me to say now um but I think
like what they were not good at is what
I I've already told you what I think I'm
good at is I think just seeing you know
they were Peter in zero to1 writes a lot
about tribes and overlapping values and
when you are coming of age um in a
computer science department or in law
school even there's a lot of people that
are Sim
everyone around you is similar and I
think that that's really important when
you're building a company but when
you're trying to bring in new Talent
especially in areas that you haven't
built things in the past you can be a
terrible judge of talent because you've
only seen one type of
person and I would say of all three of
those Joe Lono is probably the best at
dealing with outliers you know really uh
you know seeing a glint of something and
taking a chance on somebody hey everyone

[Music]
you I want to talk about an article you
recently wrote and it has an interesting
title the title is butthole
notorious that's my favorite one
actually that's cool that you zeroed in
on it can you tell our audience uh what
it's about and what what caused you to
write it you bet uh Joe has a podcast of
course uh called the American Optimist
and
um I I hold Joe obviously in the highest
regard not all of our views overlap and
it uh you know I'm the son of a farmer
uh or the the grandson of a farmer but I
I was a farm kid and you know I was
raised uh in the Summers uh working on a
farm I I you know I can barely to this
day update the the software in my cell
phone um but I'm an American and I felt
like um you know Joe had it backwards
frankly and you know so I became
interested in in amer in Optimist Comm
American and uh I've written a piece
previously um about uh David Packard you
know I grew up in carmell and which was
the capital Spanish California montere
so there's a lot of big uh original
Spanish land grants down here and a lot
of Silicon Valley has come down um and
bought these big ranches and David
Packard was the first to do that and you
know so that first article was really
about how you know these people are
going up against these massive
Industries whether it's defense you know
or you know building software for the
first time they're they're they're not
running popularity contest they're jerks
they're
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and uh so that piece kind of
came out of a play of those two
 
things it's really interesting there's a
couple of uh of quotes that I love one
is a threatened
bureaucracy will cut off its own nose
when threatened by a
 
heretic can can you what does that mean
like explain that to
us um human beings uh are fundamentally
driven by one single thing and that's a
need to
connect and unfortunately um as those as
we connect and our organizations grow
bigger we also slow
down and um you know my view is that uh
these these groups then take on the
animated properties of a human being
themselves and they will do anything at
that point to survive we see this with
 
tied to the US government now right and
and we're going to preserve That Base at
all cost we're going to preserve that
being this you know whether it's a
corporation uh or a government or an
organization at all cost and I think
what get the tricky part of this is
balancing being an individual because we
live in a hyper individualized culture
this is my favorite subject right here
you know the crisis of the individual
and this is the the the dirty little
secret is that uh you know unless you
got a really good reason to do something
differently you better stick with the
status quo and at the same time
everything has a lifespan most of all
big organizations and even governments
yep it's an amazing piece by the way um
we can L we'll link it in the show notes
I I strongly encourage everybody to read
it um going back fine I will just I'll
just say one thing on that uh my my wife
uh wrote In Comedy and
and so every piece I write but
especially that one we really worked on
together and so I write these long
terrible things and she cuts them down
by 75% but as she says uh you know she
punches it up and she's really really
great at making these things uh a lot
more fun that's a little shout out to
Kelsey yeah that's super that's super
cool that your wife is your editor and
also helping you you know write a piece
called butthole notorious like that
sounds like a great Rel Rel she yeah she
has the mouth of a
sailor we should have her on here she'd
fit in perfect love her yeah I I think
the lifespan comment is is interesting
you know I've been doing HR around tier
Peterson for about 24 years and you know
the the notorious companies like the
yahoos who were in their Heyday and then
they dwindled away and everyone kind of
cries and is sad and I kind of I
remember talking about this a few times
over the past like 15 years I'm like
look does everyone think that companies
are going to live forever like it I
don't know if it's possible um and I
just just like we talk about the
elements of like retention and keeping
people at companies now is just we don't
it doesn't have to be taboo perhaps you
know companies having a lifespan and
knowing that things come to an end also
shouldn't be T well Nolan yeah Nolan
gave me a a little tip here that we're
going to talk about the future towards
you know later um in the episode so
we'll get to some of this but I
we're you know the future of employment
um is going to radicalize in in many
ways and these Cycles are going to get
shorter yeah I'll leave it at that I
don't I don't want to steal steal your
um your thunder on that one for for
later so so Kelly on that point yep
humans love
safety and what Peterson mentioned has
been a a threat I've been thinking about
recently with the government it's about
 
are now tied to government in some way
or another like if you're at Boeing and
you're making missiles right like the
government is the buyer of those
missiles even but like state governments
are getting bigger local governments are
getting bigger and and my take on it as
I've been thinking about it for the last
couple of weeks is I think it's because
of safety and because we don't know
what's on the other side of not having
this job anymore Peterson what's your
take on that I I love that bringing this
up uh this is the the the whole issue
with connectivity is that you can't
connect with somebody unless you trust
them and that trust is fundamentally a
driver of safety our brains are wired
for this if you look at um our fear of
rejection it actually is buried deep in
our amigdala which from an evolutionary
biological perspective should tell us
how important this is think about that
ejection from the clan your safety and
numbers yes all of that and and so in
this era of expansive government you
know it starts with you know being liked
on Facebook I what an awful concept
right being friended you know bring even
being connected with on LinkedIn you
know what I do for a living these are
awful awful Concepts but they are
neurologically tapping into something so
important and at the same time like it's
having the it's having its way with us I
completely agree with they they're very
addictive because of that you know and
we talk a lot about fear on this show
Peterson when it comes to you know in
the organization right the culture
feedback communication that fear of
being rejected I.E being fired losing
your job not being good not being liked
it it drives everything well I I agree
with that I would just add fear and
love I think that we're you know I
talked a second ago about everything
being driven by connection and if if you
dig into that a little bit it's really
motivated that you know whether you know
when you kicked your dogs out uh before
this interview or you even showed up
here every single thing you do in life
is driven by one of those two things
fear or love when I rode my motorcycle
up that ramp that was pure love when
Kevin put the trash can on my head that
was pure
fear and the and here's just the Mind
bender and we don't have to get into
this today but I actually think they're
the same thing interesting that's a Zen
perspective let let me let me tangit
this a little bit because I you know I
see just from a therapy session it's
preventative care I go like once every
two months and oh I think everybody
should do thery I go I I go twice a week
in fact right after this I'm going to
therapy I love it there was a time where
it was once every two weeks but now it's
once every two months so here we go um
guilt and Sh by the way when you work
for Joe and Kevin you need to go twice a
week oh there we
go do they go or just you
I don't think I should comment on that
but I will tell I will tell you that
I've asked them to talk to my therapist
that's
incredible um fear and love I I agree I
love it how do you see guilt and shame
fitting into that equation I have talked
about that quite a bit yeah these I
they're very powerful U because of
course you know it's Nolan's point that
um we you know fear uh
we want safety and safety is just
another uh mechanism for avoiding
avoiding vulnerability and I don't I you
know there's just so much work or or so
much stuff on this topic that it's not
mine to to pontificate on you know
Bernay Brown and uh and such but I I
think vulnerability is an incredibly
powerful thing including
oversharing including coming at people
with your
guilt right these these are forc
multipliers that um can be used for good
and bad interesting it's just the last
piece on this thread is like I think the
one thing I I'm an outsider I've never
met uh you know Peter or Joe I have met
Keith before um but it seems like the
one thing all of them have in common is
no
filter yeah you know I I was talking
about uh you know being buried deep in
the amydala and sometimes I wonder yeah
where's the prefrontal cortex
right I remember here's a good story for
you U with with uh with Peter
uh you know this very eager software
engineer comes uh running up to him
Peter has this theory about conferences
only go to a conference if you're going
to speak at it and this is one of the
early Ted conferences and when it was
held here in my hometown Carmel Monterey
and this eager kid comes up to him and
starts just vomiting on him you just
tell telling him his his you know life
story and about how Peter has changed it
and influenced it and you know any one
of us here would have just been so kind
to this person and just been so grateful
that this person would approach us with
their life story and I remember Peter
doing the same thing you know I talked
about looking up in the rightand corner
he looks up and then he looks he goes
I'm sorry I'm just really not into this
conversation and doesn't walk off just
just stands
there so let's take something positive
out of that it's discomfort right how
often can any of us just be
uncomfortable and I think that these
Kevin Joe Peter we can call them awkward
uh inappropriate no filter how about
just calling them tough how about just
saying and I don't mean tough on others
I mean like just sitting with something
hard I love that story I'm thinking
about using that move a little bit what
what did the kid do
I I got the kid I felt so bad for him I
think I gave him a hug yeah and and you
know I I think he goes to therapy now
with me or
something that's it's so amazing because
it it does encapsulate like what I know
and the stories that I've heard about
that Trio of people and you know I
learned something interesting from from
Henry as the CEO of cada that there's
power and
silence amen and most people don't
Embrace silence they want to fill the
airtime and just being quiet and sitting
with something that feels really awkward
often is a very powerful move in a
discussion 100% this is a perfect follow
up to your point just a second ago about
uh guilt and vulnerability because
silence is the most vulnerable
thing you know and I talked about you
know being kicked off The College radio
as long as you're talking it's hard to
get kicked off but in silence that's
when you take your shots God that's good
man okay I want to get into Team
Construction now oh this part is going
to be far less interesting I'm a
terrible team Builder you you build me
you build me at this uh I I'll I'll be
quiet
 
okay this is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brilliant okay
you have helped build some of the most
generational companies of our
time what is the secret to company
construction that first hire everybody
talks everybody asks me Founders come to
me all the time when we're on boarding
them you know have three to 400
portfolio companies now and the first
thing that they always ask me is like
tell me about team culture these you
know young eager kids you know maybe 19
years old and has dropped out of MIT
tell me about team culture and I always
tell them the same thing it is an
extension of the founder
and um that holds true I think for your
first 10
hires so one thing I want to say on this
point is a bit of a um a contrarian
Point everybody looks for those 10x
hires that that Define that team culture
what nobody ever talks about is avoiding
the that one toxic
hire because that will do more damage to
building teams than anything when you're
 
working 100 hour weeks and then you're
the person at your side gets offed for
any reason they were a toxic hire
whatever it's it a company you know can
lose so much time in trying to reput
itself back together you know you're
trying to perambulate around on regrown
regrown limbs but the most concise
answer there is like looking for that
first outside hire we talk a lot about
you know recruiting internally in our
known networks and we have some very
specific ratios about how much of our
Outreach has to be outside of those
those networks so that we're constantly
bringing in new New Blood you know we
own recruiting out of Stanford CS
recruiting out of Stanford right that's
a well-known fact I look at Palante here
yep well now we're spending a lot of
time with these tier 2 schools uh places
where people might have a chip on their
shoulder uh places where people are
learning to fight from the
bottom uh but those you know of
identifying those that early 10x higher
is is the most important thing to do
it's really interesting um and so when
you when you say like the the pipeline
from Stanford I'm assuming you're
referring to ABC
yeah yeah why I I am I'm am surprised
you guys are starting to look at tier
two schools because there's always been
like this uh or at least historically
there's been an elitism that I've I've
seen from you guys uh in your recruiting
practices that's very fair and and so
why are you changing now
yeah well one uh some of it's practical
um the when you're in an engineering
particularly rocketry or robotics uh
some of the state schools you know you
look at Michigan calply like the it the
difference in the quality of Education
just isn't there like I just don't see
the
differentiator Meanwhile we're you know
we're I I think that we're doing a lot
of these kids and and Injustice at these
top schools about constantly telling
them how great they are I mean
go look at the the recent um you know
interview with the CEO and founder of
Nvidia J W Nvidia yep unbelievable I
encourage everybody to look at that
everyone needs to watch it totally agree
yeah yeah maybe you can share a link to
that here but uh you know so part of
it's just practical there are really
good kids at State
schools and then uh the part that I like
the best is just um you know the softer
side a lot of these you know look for
you know we have this philosophy of give
a busy kid a job and the job gets done
so looking for kids that uh you know one
of the key wordss that we use on
LinkedIn is Varsity is athlete is um
Captain uh we look for people that you
know had jobs uh we look for people that
worked two jobs at the same time and you
see it like we have I have a candidate
right now that is without telling his
employers I'm not endorsing this but
he's literally working at two Elon
companies at the same time and nobody
knows yeah it's interesting the the
pedigree of the past that was thought of
as a positive signal right is like
Stanford Harvard Yale I think it's a
mistake to end to over index on on
education but I still understand you
know when you C when it comes to talent
I know I'm interrupting you here I I I
also want to point out the weaknesses
and the arguments that I'm making when
we talk to really good talent people we
almost always want them either a never
have worked in Talent OR or B have gone
to a good
school because it takes great to
recognize great and so I just want to
punch poke some holes in in my own
arguments here yeah I like I I do think
the pedigree of the future though is
going to be a lot more around
grit how do you yeah that's a real
that's a great point I just wonder how
you measure it but yeah yeah I well I
think you described it working two jobs
being an athlete and a great student
it's what you're what you do in your
life well okay and you talked earlier
about what's happening with the
expansion of government and and the
seeking of of safety um I yeah I think
sitting with hard
things people just don't
do life just got way too easy in many
ways California and and and I know I'm
digressing you can edit this out but uh
you know California doesn't look that
different from Italy we are a lifestyle
State now we produce great olive oil
great wine Drive beautiful cars and the
uh Hills are studded with beautiful oak
trees yeah Kelly we need to do that
segment on uh on the on the the the bill
that they're trying to pass right now in
California that you can't text me after
 
here too Peterson i' it's changed a
native California G yeah t yeah this is
interesting you know we have a no uh
auto reply uh
 
policy and we're currently being sued
actually by a former employee for for uh
you know for texting them at at 400 and
 
morning well maybe maybe you guys were
the the basis of the idea to pass the
legislation look at look at the fine
text the fine print Peterson's in there
pet I do have what my what my client
means to
say I have uh just one one more question
and you know in all your time working
with your portfolio companies and
whatnot I'm just curious your experience
with your um observations on the HR
function in general HR leaders the chro
CEO CEO founder relationship um I'm sure
you have thoughts opinions or
experiences I just love your
take yeah I mean everybody has that
their own definition of like what when a
company's you know culture you know
changes and people love to say you know
when you hire HR and there's a
well-known battle drawn between
recruiters like me and HR that see each
other as their you know and uh I don't
hold any of those views I think uh uh HR
uh you know when when done right makes
people familiar with the performance
standards of a global company but I'll
tell you what we do look for in hiring
uh our first people uh officers um it's
it's either an engineering or a law
background so that they've been
operationally involved wow good HR
people have managed a p&amp;l and so you
know if I were you know I would never be
hired um you to you know loose loose lip
sync ships guy but
um you know I I would be looking you
know to
gain operational experience p&amp;l
responsibility like really having your
own um uh Survival on the line then you
really understand yeah is that hard and
fast rule Peterson I mean you would
never hire someone if they didn't have
that is that no I'm not a hard hard and
fast rule guy but as I'm thinking about
specific people that I would point out
right now they actually came you know we
Peter uh you know well-known you know
law guy you know law student he was in
one of those rubrics right and we love
hiring people from law
backgrounds because Keith yes uh they
are very good at thinking several moves
down the chessboard
very good at anticipating counterparty
motivations so they make you know they
make great CH Chief people officers
super interesting tell can you tell us
the paler story in the early paler team
story specifically I don't think that
that's my story to tell but I will tell
you you know my
limited uh uh early
day vantage point so and it relates
directly to the motorcycle story uh you
know
we there was a first hire both at zoom
and later at paler uh well-known guy
named guy Godfather of one of my
daughters uh sham
Sankar and he was at Stanford and he had
built a remittance business to you know
basically had done in his dorm room what
we were trying to do with uh you know1
or20 million from Peter this kid was
doing on his own in a dorm room at
Stanford and I dragged him in
and kind of wound him up and put him in
front of everybody I'm like tell them
what you just told me and he went up
he's like this is why you're going to
fail and he did his thing and we like
hired him on the spot uh and you know he
sham uh went on to build zoom's product
and then later um be their head of
Business Development uh and we hired Joe
lawdale as an intern at at uh at zoom
and that was the the early beginnings of
of paler what I want to tell you here
the most interesting kind of non-
Peterson perspective on this is you know
Peter set out when he when Joe and Peter
and Sham and and everybody started out
with paler they wanted to organize the
world's information organize and analyze
the world's information it was it was
like building an oracle from scratch it
was crazy paler is older than Facebook
consider that but they defined a whole
generation you know they defined big
data and then they were smart enough to
to look at this and say like we don't
want to bill for services we want to we
want to build software and we want to
sell seats and and access to that
software and it was an extraordinary
Vision at the time God that's so cool
the the thing that keeps coming up in
this conversation which is also another
PE Peter
talism is finding undiscovered Talent
like you just mentioned Joe came in as
an intern
yeah how are you finding these people
well I'll let you in on some of my
secrets I hate sharing these things uh
because they literally are what we use
on LinkedIn uh so I'm going to get a lot
of angry text messages from my team
after this um we we use very strange
keywords and we use very strange lists
uh one is chess Champions looking for
people with a National Chess score we
look for people that took the Latin exam
we look for people that uh were the best
people always leave their country
Americans living abroad are you know
number for number usually smarter harder
working more Curious and the ones that
stayed at home just like we are a
country of
immigrants so we have these weird
LinkedIn features filters where we will
actually build lists of the top
engineering schools and everybody does
this for India but I mean in Italy I
mean the Grande KS and and in France uh
and you can there are these mechanis Ms
on LinkedIn where you can actually look
for somebody that graduated from one of
these schools but is living in
California so these people like Peter
has this theory of like it's great U
actually is a Trey Stevens
uh Trace even speaks to this at least
more more
frequently when you hire somebody for
faith meaning that they are a Christian
or they're Jewish or Muslim or whatever
one of his favorite questions is did
they choose to be that themselves like
if they just did what their parents did
it's it's obviously less interesting but
I I've been given a lot of crazy
searches in the early days of palent
where I had to go find you know a Jew
that was married to a Christian that was
gay living from the Outback of Australia
no joke that was an actual search string
I was
given is what does that tell you the I
well we were looking specifically at the
time uh to build uh Asia Pacific region
we're doing that in Australia and we
were looking for people that were
signals that they had done something
very very hard out of personal choice
and conviction on on their own on their
own so this is an incredible aha moment
for me I I have never heard this in my
whole career and well you're not allowed
to say it I just so so if I get this
right Peterson Peter is telling you
these things these theories are coming
up yeah increasingly through his chief
of staff but yes okay so looks up at the
corner and he looks down and he says go
find me chess players now is that kind
of how looks up at the corner and he
goes [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
Peterson that's actually my another go
find me a Gayu that lives in like this
is I want to I need to work with this
guy this is incredible very
interesting Peterson we have to have you
back we to I feel like we've I feel like
we've scratched the surface of my own
personal curiosity of the inner workings
of Founders fund 8 VC Palante here and
all of these amazing places that you've
worked at can I please I want to tell
you my my greatest Peter teal story I've
never told anyone and this a great great
risk um but uh during the Paris uh and
Brussels bombings and in in Europe in
you know 20145 I think it was um the
French government couldn't be seen as
working with a US software company and
so we were holding all of these meetings
these clandestine meetings basically in
the hotel lobbies these five star hotels
that we wouldn't even be staying at we
would just set up there as if we were
staying and we would interview young
software Engineers who would have show
up not having any idea who had had
invited them we couldn't say paler I uh
you know called my friend Trey at
Founders fund and I said hey I got to
let you know what I'm doing and he
basically was like blah blah blah I
don't want to hear I don't want to hear
I don't want to hear because I I printed
my own Founders fund stationary and I
sent out letters I literally hired a
young G to write around on a moped
around Paris hand delivering letters and
for a while if you if you Googled
Peterson Conway it autop populated the
Peterson Conway letter I sent so many
letters the only time I've ever been uh
in the Press actually in the front cover
of the New York Times was because I was
sending letters on behalf of Peter to
getting kids to drop out of college and
I was getting all this hate mail from
their mothers but so I'd sent out these
letters and I just signed it P you know
Peterson but of course there was some
room for inter so these kids would show
up and it became this game of could we
get somebody to accept a job get all the
way through their interviews in this
random hotel lobby accept a job without
ever knowing who the actual company
was and we we succeeded at that we built
up a big team uh in France that later uh
went on to run
Airbus uh but I had this kid on my last
day I was getting to the airport and I
had a couple of people with me and we're
rushing at the airport and I was eager
to get home we held all these successful
meetings this kid shows up and he's got
my letter and he sits down he says I
just need a moment with you and he says
I was at a dinner party with Peter teal
last night and I showed him this letter
and I just went white
I mean at this point I was pretty
removed you know and I had somewhat
covered my tracks with Trey but I really
had done something that I I really
shouldn't have done and he goes I want
you to know that I'm on to you and I
just didn't know what to say and I was
silent and he says Peter denied this
letter and then I was doubly scared and
he goes and I know that he actually sent
 
it and I'm like you're right I got to go
to the
airport and welcome aboard yeah and
evidently uh yeah I had sent the letter
unknowingly to a company that Peter had
funded and he was there at a cocktail
party with the founder was a was a
friend of his and this kid showed up
with the letter and this is the sort of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you know that they I guess
kind of look the other way and allow us
to go after like the hardest to reach
people because the best people never
look for a job that reminds me that
reminds me of my favorite value from the
door Dash early days which is ask for
forgiveness not for permission yes beg
for forgiveness that would yeah if I
could figure out how to say that in
Latin I'd tattoo it on my my shoulder
shoulder but there but there for the
grace of God goai how do we get Peter on
here is my question oh my God Peterson
this was so good this is so good thanks
great so much for this time you guys are
real pros this was fun oh it was so fun
and the biggest takeway is that you
would never hire me as a CPO in your
