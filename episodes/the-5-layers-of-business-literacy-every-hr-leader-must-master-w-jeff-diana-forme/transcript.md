Hey everybody. A few weeks ago, we
started bringing back some Essential
Heretics 101 content. For today, we're
discussing how HR professionals can move
beyond traditional people operations to
become true business leaders through
practical tactical strategies. featuring
Jeff Diana, investor, entrepreneur, and
former CPO of Kalandley.
We have our good friend Jeff Diana back
on with us today for a short segment.
You know, Jeff, he's been around the
block a few times, multiple times, CPO,
board member, adviser, etc. So, how you
doing, Jeff?
Doing well. Good to catch up.
Yep. Same. So, Nolan, Jeff and I went to
the Elevate conference in LA a couple
months ago. This was the one hosted by
Noetic CPO HQ. It was great. So Jeff
moderated a panel and it was all about
this concept that we all know about HR
people being business people first. Some
of the people were like, I'm so tired of
hearing this. Like it's just been this
thing for years. Has the puck really
moved? And so it was a really good chat
and we thought in this segment we could
kick the ball around a little and share
some highlights, some of the questions
and get your take as well. No one.
That's my initial take when I hear that
is like, "Oh my god, I've heard this
discussion, but it actually hasn't
translated into any specific action for
the most part." So, what what did you
guys talk about? What happened?
And so, that was it. People were like,
"Uh, it's like the old HR is at the
table, like Jesus, what does that mean?"
And so, it was all about not just saying
this stuff and talking at 80,000 ft, but
what do you do? What does that
tactically mean? and unpacking what the
hell that is so that people that were
there could take away some things to do.
So the first thing we kind of said is
like HR is business leaders first. That
is the most you know like what the hell
does that mean? So we talked about what
does that mean in your mind as far as
like break it down Jeff Nolan and I can
too on what exactly that means because
it's been thrown around so many times. I
ask 10 people I get seven different
answers.
Yeah. When I try to your point, it's
kind of funny because this conversation
has been going going on for a while and
there was frustration that we're still
having it. Yet, I think at the same time
there was still an acknowledgement that
we're not there yet, right? So, we could
be frustrated by it, but what the heck
do we do about it? When I think about
being that business leader first
mentality, I like to think about it in
sort of dos and don'ts. And the
correlary I give is we always talk about
our values at a company. You're like,
what does it look like? And sometimes
people are good by seeing the what you
do and sometimes they're like the
absolutely don't do right or is equally
valuable. So to me when you start a
conversation when you dissect an issue
where do you start from? Do you start
from classic HR oriented activities like
what programs do we offer? Will are
people like it? Will they be happy with
it? Like we're in our own track of
thinking. A business lead or first HR
person starts by understanding what is
the financial variables? What's our
trend within it? How is that tracking to
where the business would like to be? How
does it look relative to competitors or
the market? So, it's all about those
financial measures, those external
variables, those trends in our company
performance. Nowhere in there is how
will it impact our people? Will our
people be happy with it? How do we sell
it to our people? It's all about that
business orientation, marketing,
customer landscape. So, starting with
those measures, I think is the number
one way that I see people talk about it.
And when I talk about it and people tell
me you don't seem like a an HR person at
all, part of me gets very frustrated at
that comment. I know there's a
compliment in it. And when you ask them
to unpack it, they say, one, you conduct
the numbers as well as a functional
leader and two, you never give me any of
that HR speak or HR jargon. And so on
the don't list to me that's important. I
never start with we ought to do this.
It's the right thing to do kind of
concept. Now I have that lens guiding me
not not only a personal moral compass
but a cultural compass for the company
but it's not my plan of attack and how I
speak or how I try and influence on a
decision. And so those kind of two
elements to me are probably the best
examples I can give. One litmus test
that I often you know when I was in the
seat I used to say is like in the last
two weeks who on the seauite team have I
had like a very very intense
conversation about our business and our
direction like no HR no nothing but who
have I gone toeto- toe with not
necessarily toeto- toe but who have I
chatted with about what we're doing
where we're going etc that was a big
witness test for me because I think that
starts to change you you know, the
perception of us only talking about the
the HR stuff. And there's two things
that I'll add that I I really didn't
think about enough early in my career
that I think are pretty actually
powerful. And one is not just do you
know your business, the one that you sit
in, but do you understand the market
landscape, the competitive nature? Can
you talk about what you're doing in
relation to what's going on outside?
because that's where I've seen and I've
actually myself gotten kind of stumped
or brickwalled where the conversation
quickly went to a competitive nature and
whatnot and I couldn't really talk to
that and that is a speed bump. The
second one, and this is kind of
interesting because it might be
controversial, is I don't think you can
be a great influencer and a business
leader in founder-led companies unless
you understand how the founder is
actually irrational, maybe irrational
about their business, about their
product, about their baby because
that matters, right? like you can come
with all the data and all the stuff, but
I mean Nolan's a CEO and if it's
something that he feels so visceral
about and so emotional about, you have
to talk about that a little bit
differently and you're not going to get
very far. And so I just want to put it
out there that understanding and
somewhat empathizing with this this
founder emotion is a big part of leading
the business.
Yeah. And I think look to your point
around influencing why do you do that?
Why do you get out there and talk to the
customer and do CS? It's like so you
understand literally how the the work
unfolds in the business. You can talk
intelligently about it. Why do you have
to understand the business economics to
do the same thing? Because when you're
in that room with other leaders, they're
talking about the overall impact of the
company on its financials, on its
shareholders, on its customers. So, we
don't have that level of knowledge. We
can't contribute. One thing you said,
Kelly, to me is like knowing knowing the
numbers. Like when I think about this
and I talk to folks in HR that are like
I want to be more businessoriented. I'll
usually ask them and I'm thinking of
layers of the cake around the metrics
right usually simple question like do
you know your operating plan and the
goals? Sure know that. Now they may not
know how that work unfolds to Nolan's
point of like being in the track doing
it. I may ask them like well do you
understand our financials? Usually I get
a little bit more wobble. I might be
able to tell you the AR growth number
but can they really go through and
dissect the financials? Then I ask them
like within those two things, do you
really understand the functional metrics
of our business? Like what is CS
measuring? What do they care about? What
is engineering driving? What is the
marketing team looking at? Do you even
know the top metrics, let alone the
trends on them? And that's all still
insular. Then you go to the outside of
like what about our competitors? Do you
know their health? Do you know their
performance? Do you know the broader
market landscape? Do you understand
macroeconomic trends going on in the
world and around interest rates and the
flow of money and the price of money?
Like there's so many layers to this cake
and the most effective HR leaders are
well schooled in all of those and they
leverage all of those in the
conversation because what I actually
find fascinating as much as we feel like
we're at this position of lack of
literacy and we are guess what most of
our functional leaders can't cover all
those layers of the cake either. So if
you can and you can have some knowledge
as broad as macroeconomics to markets to
competitors to us and you have some
insight across that and you bring that
into the conversation now you're not
only adding real value to the business
but you have legitimacy to your voice in
a way you've never had before.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
Your workforce is your organization's
greatest strength and often its largest
single expense. But without the right
tools, understanding where your
workforce spend is going or how it

I must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talented signal fire,
told me to check out Metaview. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting." And
this product is sick. Metave is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview. And I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. MeteView changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process.
Metaview covers all your compliance
needs, works with all your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at
organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora, and check out
Metave. Head over to metav.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metabuse's product
experts. Tell them that me and Kelly
sent you. Or you could just go to their
website and get started for free. You'll
be up, running, and AI enabled in
minutes.
Then you take it when you're sitting in
the other ones then it is your job as a
leader to take those learnings back and
synthesize the learnings for your team
right because that's that's the main
thing is like hey it's great for you to
get this knowledge but if your team can
be a reflection of that then all of a
sudden like the sound bite internally
changes and that's when you really start
to win the war and when it's like we
don't think of them as the HR or
recruiting team we just think of them as
our as our colleagues.
Totally. And at first it might be like,
"Oh, how cute. Look, HR wants to do a
review." Like, fine, you know, take it.
Get in the ring and keep going.
I tell you two other examples to me
where it's helpful. One, I've always
pushed my team to say we can impact the
business as a function by being the best
run discipline in the company. And you
think about what we want to advise the
company on. It's their spend, their
efficiency, how well they operate, how
well they execute, their org design, all
these types of things. And so I try to
rally my team on and pride myself on
wanting to be recognized as the bestrun
function in the company because there is
respect from functional and business
leaders of like they know how to run an
amazing ship. That's everything from how
we define and execute on work, how well
we can measure what we do. All of those
types of activities our operating rhythm
of how we meet how efficient it is
because we all know at the company level
there's inefficiency in there and if we
can demonstrate high performance I've
been at several companies where cos have
said you have the best run function of
the company help teach us how to run the
company more efficient more effectively
and that's not just squeezing cost right
that's how well we execute how well we
can predict how knowledgeable the team
is all of that type of stuff and it
gives HR teams something to rally around
where we do feel like especially outside
of the seauite role you're like I'm just
deep in the business like I'm off on an
island I do this little functional work
now it's like no we can be about the
business show them something that will
impact the business and that gains a ton
of credibility
yeah and also the mobility right just to
be you know a little selfish for a
minute we're seeing more fluidity now
with HR folks going into the business
and business folks going to HR that that
is I mean I was in a go to market role
for a year before I left Pendo and you
don't you don't do that unless you can
demonstrate and understand that you you
know add value. So there's a lot of
things around that that are really cool
that that could open up with this too.
Yeah. I'll give you a great example when
I was at Success Factors with with Lars.
I still remember my first 30 days on the
job and the thing that Lars was most
impressed with was I asked to go to
sales kickoff. HR had not typically gone
and I literally met every single
salesperson there. I didn't sit at the
dinner. I went table to table. I met
folks. I asked what they were working
on. I told them call upon me. Now
granted, you know, selfish advantage.
We're selling to HR so they care a
little bit more about what we think.
Yeah. Yeah. But where did that lead?
That led to the sales organization
going, "Wow, he gets it. Maybe we should
get him into some deals." And it led to
my team taking our own sales quota. I
had two or three members make sales club
every year I was there because we sold
so much for the business with the
business. And that would have never
happened if I had just pitched the
concept. But I got out into the
business. They showed I was
knowledgeable. They showed I cared that
I was willing to learn and roll up my
sleeves. and then they were willing to
let me into those functional areas to
have greater impact. They're going to
let you into their business by virtue of
you're knowledgeable and you've sort of
been vetted that you get it and you're
smart and you're intelligent. It's going
to open up opportunities to have more
impact for the the people function than
we will get otherwise.
Amen.
This is great. Anything else from you
from you both on this for today?
No, I think I think you guys nailed it.
I'm at like again for somebody who's
like generally annoyed with this topic.
I think these are the the tactical
things people should do in order to make
sure that they actually are thought of
as a respected colleague, which is the
goal.
Awesome. Well, great to see you, Jeff.
