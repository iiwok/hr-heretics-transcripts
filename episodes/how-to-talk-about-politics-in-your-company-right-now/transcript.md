# How to Talk About Politics in Your Company Right Now

## Transcript

 
there's conflict in the Middle East
Kelly and a lot of Founders and chro are
asking themselves how do we talk about
this situation and so I'll give you just
a little insight into the way that we
think about it at Continuum I I don't
know if this is right but I'm just going
to tell you what we do and I would love
to get your take on things we follow the
Brian Armstrong we don't talk about
politics at work in general we are
trying to build a business and
ultimately we want to be so successful
that our employees get wealthy from this
experience and that they can allocate
their wealth to solve problems that we
cannot solve as a business so Kelly I'm
actually curious about your take and how
you guys think about this and how you
specifically think about solving this
problem I will speak to this more
generally in my experience as a cheap
people officer and it's actually not to
not talk about things at work I tend to
take the the middle ground on a lot of
things and try and be in as inclusive as
possible but with clear boundaries if
that makes sense so for us a lot of the
the pieces around this was talk about it
with groups of people that feel
comfortable talking about it versus
companywide channels Etc that are really
there for doing business so clubs
specific Affinity groups lunchtime
meetings communities of Silence other
chat groups right we we never shut that
down we actually encourage that I do
like the boundary element though as far
as it seeping in to the day-to-day and
for me it's never never been easy right
because in our roles we might have
different viewpoints and as example I
had a situation once right I'm lgbtq I
have a wife Etc and we have an lgbtq
affinity group most do and I had someone
say look I want an affinity group for
Christian conservative values
that are yes against the LGBT you know
and we had to deal with that and it was
like H like right that inclusivity I
think is a very very common denominator
that we have to solve for is even if
it's like 1% of a hundred everyone
should feel like they have a voice but
where you put that voice and how you
have that voice interact with
companywide values and where we do
business I think that's the work so did
you draw the line or did you create a
new group we did not allow for a again a
company sponsored affinity group cuz
again I'm like damn what's what's the
backbone like how do I simplify and that
affinity group would fly in the face of
one of our biggest values which is
respect for all that example is exactly
the reason why I don't want to talk
about it at work CU creating that line
is it's arbitrary it is arbitrary and it
does take a lot of time so you're saying
that you didn't didn't even have it
anywhere yeah we put it in our culture
docs explicitly stating we do not talk
about politics at work our take is is
that many of these topics are
controversial and just getting even into
that context and Nuance takes up a ton
of time and is a
distraction and so I I know it's not
like the warm and fuzzy culture I do
believe companies should indicate to
candidates during the interview process
how they view politics at work and let
candidates either opt in or opt out
because once somebody is there and if
then if you change policies on them it's
a little bit unfair because they
accepted a job you know with a with a
premise or a guise of how they expected
you to respond and then you move the
ball around on them and that's where I
do think coinbase did it right is they
said look we are changing our policy and
we are also allowing you to opt out and
we will give you Severance to opt out
and I think that's done really well and
I think a lot of companies are now
following in their footsteps I
personally think that we should allow
some of this conversation at work I
think it's going to happen anyway Nolan
whether you have your handbook or not we
talked about this in our Patty episode
like sometimes things are slippery
slopes and all of a sudden everything is
in that consideration set so I do
applaud folks like you that are like no
it out but I think that it's going to
seep in anyway I guess is my there's not
a perfect answer I think is is the short
answer here and unfortunately Founders
and cheap people officers do have to
figure out their stance and how they
navigate these issues and so all I can
recommend is to think about it
beforehand because when you're in it
tensions rise and it's really easy uh to
get pulled along in a narrative um or
onto one side as to where you should be
and if you think about it beforehand and
how you're going to respond to these
sorts of things hopefully it provides a
little bit more clarity when you
actually are in the fog of War like I
remember when George Floyd happened and
whatnot I mean we had leaders running
around grabbing HR leaders like toddlers
on their pant leg being like what do I
do what do I do what do I do and that
wasn't that long ago this is I think
this is this is fairly new it it
absolutely is I'm not saying it should
be like that well and that's but that's
kind of my point is like there is a new
expectation from employees that a
company comments every for every
situation that happens I don't think
that's a fair expectation I think your
stance on it is we will comment but we
will say we don't know this is really
hard and that's that's fair I think
another take that more companies are
starting to lean into
is we're just not going to comment and
talk about it it's not perfect because
you don't want to people to be
robots um and I don't expect that but I
I do think now in this new world with
higher interest rates valuations lower
harder to fundraise companies have to
focus on building real businesses I
don't think we will have a choice it's
like another [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing to solve but
if you solve it when there isn't a
crisis I think it's a lot better for
everybody
I agree I but like I said I think it
will be part of the table Stakes like
intake form of what companies need to
think about going forward totally but
let's also empathize this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is not
easy like a lot of times companies
Founders even she people officers avoid
leaning into this until they have to
because it's scary and there is fear of
what the responses are and what the
reactions are and if I can avoid it and
not deal with any reaction that might be
less distracting
acting but I think we are getting to a
point now where that's going to be more
and more impossible I think it is
impossible I think we're already there
the more you try and Tuck this thing
under the rug the bigger the problem
becomes and the harder it is to solve
for me this is the future of work
conversation that is the real
conversation around the future of work
