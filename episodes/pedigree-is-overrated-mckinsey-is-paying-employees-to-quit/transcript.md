a timeline for which to do that uh and
it worked really well now the thing I'll
 
it worked really well now the thing I'll
say about this though and we've talked
 
say about this though and we've talked
about this many times is Clarity
 
about this many times is Clarity
transparency and Clarity of identity I
 
transparency and Clarity of identity I
don't know if they're being honest about
 
don't know if they're being honest about
that or not like one could discern that
 
that or not like one could discern that
right a reasonable person could discern
 
right a reasonable person could discern
based on the article and this option
 
based on the article and this option
that this is going to happen but you
 
that this is going to happen but you
have to say and this is what's going to
 
have to say and this is what's going to
happen to give people all the
 
happen to give people all the
information if you want to stay here and
 
information if you want to stay here and
you don't want to raise your hand you're
 
you don't want to raise your hand you're
rolling the dice a little bit so I don't
 
rolling the dice a little bit so I don't
know if they're being upfront about that
 
know if they're being upfront about that
but that is the key in my mind and
 
but that is the key in my mind and
especially the why behind it you know
 
especially the why behind it you know
that's really interesting Kelly so okay
 
that's really interesting Kelly so okay
so here's I I've done the opt out too at
 
so here's I I've done the opt out too at
CA when we did our layoff in 2020 uh we
 
CA when we did our layoff in 2020 uh we
gave people the opportunity to take the
 
gave people the opportunity to take the
same Severance as the impacted employees
 
same Severance as the impacted employees
I'm now every time I talk to a founder
 
I'm now every time I talk to a founder
or a che people officer who's doing a
 
or a che people officer who's doing a
layoff I recommend they do this um
 
layoff I recommend they do this um
because ultimately you want people in
 
because ultimately you want people in
the business who want to be there and if
 
the business who want to be there and if
they don't want to be there give them
 
they don't want to be there give them
the opportunity to leave in the same way
 
the opportunity to leave in the same way
that you're giving the severance to
 
that you're giving the severance to
folks that are being impacted now that
 
folks that are being impacted now that
said the Counterpoint is all always well
 
said the Counterpoint is all always well
what about business
 
what about business
continuity and 9 months of severance is
 
continuity and 9 months of severance is
a legit package like you got to tip your
 
a legit package like you got to tip your
hat to that like that's that's like at
 
hat to that like that's that's like at
the top of the scale and so how did you
 
the top of the scale and so how did you
guys think about the business continuity
 
guys think about the business continuity
issue yeah that's where the timeline
 
issue yeah that's where the timeline
comes in you know what I mean so like
 
comes in you know what I mean so like
and and the scale too I will say the
 
and and the scale too I will say the
bigger the company arguably the harder
 
bigger the company arguably the harder
it is right we were 400 people so if I
 
it is right we were 400 people so if I
have 30 people that raise their hand I
 
have 30 people that raise their hand I
can talk to them one by one we can plan
 
can talk to them one by one we can plan
for what's going on in the business we
 
for what's going on in the business we
can interesting you know if someone
 
can interesting you know if someone
raises their hand we don't want to raise
 
raises their hand we don't want to raise
their hand you can try to figure out how
 
their hand you can try to figure out how
to keep or what not but if you can't you
 
to keep or what not but if you can't you
have enough time to to think about
 
have enough time to to think about
succession planning before the rift so
 
succession planning before the rift so
that was the chronology of the timing at
 
that was the chronology of the timing at
scale it might be harder but still
 
scale it might be harder but still
possible as long as it's all not happy
 
possible as long as it's all not happy
at the same time that makes sense yeah
 
at the same time that makes sense yeah
that's it makes total sense so you're
 
that's it makes total sense so you're
just basically saying like hey if like
 
just basically saying like hey if like
if you have a 45,000 person company and
 
if you have a 45,000 person company and
call it 3,000 people raise their hand
 
call it 3,000 people raise their hand
logistically it's going to be a
 
logistically it's going to be a
nightmare to have all of those
 
nightmare to have all of those
conversations but like that's the
 
conversations but like that's the
trade-off of not doing a broad-based
 
trade-off of not doing a broad-based
drift that's the tradeoff and you know
 
drift that's the tradeoff and you know
presumably that people team is
 
presumably that people team is
multipliers bigger as well so it's just
 
multipliers bigger as well so it's just
it's just a matter of scale with the
 
it's just a matter of scale with the
same motions you know and then someone
 
same motions you know and then someone
could be like well that's a nightmare
 
could be like well that's a nightmare
fine but it's a nightmare if they all
 
fine but it's a nightmare if they all
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quit the same time anyway it's
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quit the same time anyway it's
