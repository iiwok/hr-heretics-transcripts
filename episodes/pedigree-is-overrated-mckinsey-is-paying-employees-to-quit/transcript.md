firm so here's the background in 2018
McKenzie had about 28,000
employees now they have about 45 ,000
seems like they over hire during the
pandemic as did many tech companies and
what they're trying to do now is to
reduce headcount and the way that
they're trying to reduce headcount
instead of doing a riff is by offering
people the opportunity to quit and to
start looking for a job they will give
you nine months of pay you don't have to
work anymore but you can't come work at
the firm what you take yep look uh let's
just break this into pieces a little bit
Yeah so I actually applaud the opt out
move I am not opposed to that move at
all we did that at hired back in
 
business we had to reduce and shift
skills and yes we were doing a rift but
as a part of that we also gave an opt
out we'll give you six months etc etc
and and we actually got more hand raises
than we anticipated which made the
reduction easier right oh you guys did
it before the we did it during the same
we did it during the same time we
announced there was going to be a riff
right and then and the why behind it and
this and that and if you were thinking
about leaving anyway or you're unhappy
like help us and help us help you right
raise your hand and then we'll take that
consideration that's really interesting
a timeline for which to do that uh and
it worked really well now the thing I'll
say about this though and we've talked
about this many times is Clarity
transparency and Clarity of identity I
don't know if they're being honest about
that or not like one could discern that
right a reasonable person could discern
based on the article and this option
that this is going to happen but you
have to say and this is what's going to
happen to give people all the
information if you want to stay here and
you don't want to raise your hand you're
rolling the dice a little bit so I don't
know if they're being upfront about that
but that is the key in my mind and
especially the why behind it you know
that's really interesting Kelly so okay
so here's I I've done the opt out too at
CA when we did our layoff in 2020 uh we
gave people the opportunity to take the
same Severance as the impacted employees
I'm now every time I talk to a founder
or a che people officer who's doing a
layoff I recommend they do this um
because ultimately you want people in
the business who want to be there and if
they don't want to be there give them
the opportunity to leave in the same way
that you're giving the severance to
folks that are being impacted now that
said the Counterpoint is all always well
what about business
continuity and 9 months of severance is
a legit package like you got to tip your
hat to that like that's that's like at
the top of the scale and so how did you
guys think about the business continuity
issue yeah that's where the timeline
comes in you know what I mean so like
and and the scale too I will say the
bigger the company arguably the harder
it is right we were 400 people so if I
have 30 people that raise their hand I
can talk to them one by one we can plan
for what's going on in the business we
can interesting you know if someone
raises their hand we don't want to raise
their hand you can try to figure out how
to keep or what not but if you can't you
have enough time to to think about
succession planning before the rift so
that was the chronology of the timing at
scale it might be harder but still
possible as long as it's all not happy
at the same time that makes sense yeah
that's it makes total sense so you're
just basically saying like hey if like
if you have a 45,000 person company and
call it 3,000 people raise their hand
logistically it's going to be a
nightmare to have all of those
conversations but like that's the
trade-off of not doing a broad-based
drift that's the tradeoff and you know
presumably that people team is
multipliers bigger as well so it's just
it's just a matter of scale with the
same motions you know and then someone
could be like well that's a nightmare
fine but it's a nightmare if they all
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quit the same time anyway it's
going to be worse then you have
zero you know Head Start um arguably so
it's just hard either way but but it is
hard and McKenzie interesting huh Nolan
I mean 45 thou and and we're not talking
about you know us public school kids
coming in we're talking about creme de
La Creme like high degree high paid
Highly Educated arguably harder to screw
over the ways we've talked about you
know with companies and so that's a
tough one that's a tough one it feels
like a rug pole honestly like you know
uh even five years ago working at
McKenzie uh was just thought of as like
if you get into McKenzie like the rest
of this thing is like a gravy train yes
my my wife went to to Stanford and I you
know I went to University of New Orleans
so I the joke I always make about
Stanford is you know there's like a the
Wily Wonka golden ticket
totally and you can just like wave that
thing around and you get into all these
places that like us public school kids
can't get into and McKenzie's kind of
the same way but it feels like these
older institutions whether it be
universities or whether it be like
McKenzie Bane BCG or investment Banks it
feels like the rug is being pulled on
some of these people who have gotten in
there recently yeah because the promise
before was hey you get in here you get
this amazing Network you know you could
tap into it whenever you want uh
whatever you want to do after this
becomes easier if you come and put your
time in here and my take and I think
this is what you and I have been seeing
happening is like these older
institutions are changing yes and as it
relates to
startups the signal that you used to get
if you worked at McKenzie or if you had
a Stanford MBA was like oh my God we
must talk to this person right away yes
now
the signal is like why' they go there
yeah it's so funny like I I I agree and
before this we were we were saying that
right these schools these um
institutions we were singing We got the
golden ticket I mean your life was just
I I think honestly as as it's as simple
as as Generations you know are evolving
right like our generation were the new
bosses right 20 years ago it was the
baby boomer Our Generation
these these younger Generations are
questioning the accuracy of all of that
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I like it you know and I think
that and you're seeing it I started
seeing it 10 years ago right our best
engineer at hired in 2016 was a former
truck driver that just happened to go to
some boot camp Academy and was like
crushing code out of his van out of San
Diego it was the best one and and now
you know then we saw the Google GPA go
out the window because they were you
know they wouldn't hire anyone unless
they were a 4.0 that was gone everyone
was H questioning that and then now
we're questioning not even schools but
degrees in general you don't need a
degree like all these things are
changing and I remember back when I was
at Yahoo as well 2007 I remember the
McKenzie suits coming in and they were
helping us redo the whole go to market
model at Yahoo and they would come in
and everyone's like well they're from
McKenzie she from Mackenzie she's like a
God and it was just assumed and I and I
don't think that I'm not saying that's
bad not saying she wasn't a God I'm just
saying that I think this next crop we
are questioning things that were just
believed before and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] meter
is kind of higher so yeah these these
resume stamps that you used to be able
to get that really meant something I
think are they don't mean as much
anymore hey everyone we'll be right back
in a moment after a word from our
sponsors

heretic sent
 
you and so Kelly and I did an episode a
couple of weeks ago about how to layoff
proof yourself and really what we talked
about in that is networking um but I
think some other things that we might
have missed there Kelly that I've been
thinking about a lot is you know
everyone needs to have marketable skills
and everyone needs to be able to talk
about how those marketable skills apply
to a future
employer and you know it's we are in
such a weird time right now as these
Confluence of forces are happening of
like you know we're postco everyone over
hired and so everyone has to trim head
count interest rates are high now and so
like everyone's really being thoughtful
about their their Opex and then you have
ai coming in which is making businesses
significantly more efficient and so it's
just like on every angle there's
pressure to the existing system and so
my guidance to people that are listening
to this is things are changing really
fast and the old model is not going to
be the new model and so you have to
invest in yourself you have to invest in
your skill skills you have to learn to
talk about your skills you have to grow
your network because there is no safety
net as it used to
be yes and the thing that I'm seen
feeling and frankly have looked for
myself like the past you know X number
of years for people is the pedigree and
even to some extent like hardcore
brilliant text technical or functional
skill sets with AI with tech they will
matter less than people like being able
to work with other people and
communicate well and collaborate and
being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
well-rounded right we just talked to
Peterson Conway I won't give it away but
some of the search like parameters
they're doing on people you would never
ever think right that that that would be
a valuable thing and they're searching
for this and so I think the nature is
not like the GPA only the pedigree the
school it's are you a well-rounded
person
that can handle a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] handle
stress problem solved and work with
other people because the technology will
solve a lot of the other stuff it will
never I think solve that at least not
for you know till we're we're
gone it's it's it's a really well said
comment Kelly because you know we talk
about soft skills and soft skills are
always like this like fluff it feels
really fluffy in normal conversations
when you hear about it but what you're
talking about is problem solving skills
that's right with other people and not
the way that makes them miserable and no
one wants to work with you like exactly
really important yeah like it's it's
about business is about solving problems
and AI is not going to be near the point
of solving problems without people I
think for a long time and it's it's a
really interesting take to put a premium
on teamwork on collaboration on
resilience
which I think is in super short supply
that's right look at these kids right my
kids are what almost 14 and they they
could sit at home all day with their no
you know nose in a book and be brilliant
and not know how to like talk to a
person but get out there go play even if
you're not good at it go play [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
team sport and go go get some some grit
go get a job early figure out how to
work with people I mean the these skill
sets are really important and I've seen
a lot of these young very brilliant
people maybe Adam mckin maybe not they
they drop into these organizations
especially the ones that we're used to
and live in and they're just like eyes
wide paralyzed because it's you know
it's very messy yeah business building
it turns out is messy and I've been
talking to some friends about this who
have been thinking about searching for a
job right now and I'm like why are you
looking like a it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mess here
yeah and I was like hey I got news it's
a mess everywhere that's the point
that's why you're there to help clean it
up that's right and and I think um it's
just a very interesting time I'll leave
the audience with this you know as you
think about where you are right now in
your career and as you think about your
next move the contract between employees
and employers is changing right now and
it's changing it's moving underneath
people's feet and so the number one
thing the number one piece of advice for
me and Kelly is invest in yourself and
invest in your network because you might
need it and market so let us know what
you think give us some feedback in the
comments thanks all thanks HR Heretics
