cognition again because there's been an
cognition again because there's been an
 
cognition again because there's been an
interesting update on X from employee
interesting update on X from employee
 
interesting update on X from employee
number two. So, let me just read this to
number two. So, let me just read this to
 
number two. So, let me just read this to
everybody because it's worth the the
everybody because it's worth the the

never been a more exciting time and
never been a more exciting time and
 
never been a more exciting time and
place for it." Now, at Cognition, I had
place for it." Now, at Cognition, I had

a place at Google DeepMind as part of
a place at Google DeepMind as part of
 
a place at Google DeepMind as part of
the deal. I won't go into detail for
the deal. I won't go into detail for
 
the deal. I won't go into detail for
legal reasons, but I'd like to be
legal reasons, but I'd like to be
 
legal reasons, but I'd like to be

I was given an offer that would explode
I was given an offer that would explode
 
I was given an offer that would explode

I've chosen a different direction. For
I've chosen a different direction. For
 
I've chosen a different direction. For
someone who loves software engineering,
someone who loves software engineering,
 
someone who loves software engineering,
Cognition feels like home. It reminds me

best IDE and coding agents. So just to
best IDE and coding agents. So just to
 
best IDE and coding agents. So just to
break this down for people, right, what
break this down for people, right, what
 
break this down for people, right, what
it sounds like he's saying, the
it sounds like he's saying, the

you you need to trust. And we did go
 
you you need to trust. And we did go
through it with Looker and I will tell
through it with Looker and I will tell

you stuff got reaped back, right? Things
you stuff got reaped back, right? Things
 
you stuff got reaped back, right? Things
got reset.

got reset.
Uh, and there were a lot of sacrifices
Uh, and there were a lot of sacrifices
 
Uh, and there were a lot of sacrifices
that those leaders made to get that deal
that those leaders made to get that deal
 
that those leaders made to get that deal
through. It's great for the employees,
through. It's great for the employees,
 
through. It's great for the employees,
but that stuff happens a lot. And I
but that stuff happens a lot. And I
 
but that stuff happens a lot. And I
guess my my my takeaway is like
guess my my my takeaway is like
 
guess my my my takeaway is like
Google didn't do that. Those leaders
Google didn't do that. Those leaders
 
Google didn't do that. Those leaders
agreed to it.
agreed to it.
 
agreed to it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense? like the Windsor
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense? like the Windsor
 
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense? like the Windsor
leaders agreed to that.
leaders agreed to that.
 
leaders agreed to that.
&gt;&gt; Well, so so yeah, let's be clear like
&gt;&gt; Well, so so yeah, let's be clear like
 
&gt;&gt; Well, so so yeah, let's be clear like
let me just highlight just a couple of
let me just highlight just a couple of
 
let me just highlight just a couple of
the points that you said so people
the points that you said so people
 
the points that you said so people
really gro this thing.
really gro this thing.
 
really gro this thing.
&gt;&gt; So thing one is is like there is no such
&gt;&gt; So thing one is is like there is no such
 
&gt;&gt; So thing one is is like there is no such
thing anymore as protections, right?
thing anymore as protections, right?
 
thing anymore as protections, right?
Like every single one of these deals
Like every single one of these deals
 
Like every single one of these deals
that you have on the way in, if you're
that you have on the way in, if you're
 
that you have on the way in, if you're
an even if you're an exec, you have
an even if you're an exec, you have
 
an even if you're an exec, you have
single trigger, you have double trigger.
single trigger, you have double trigger.
 
single trigger, you have double trigger.
Go look it up if you don't know what it
Go look it up if you don't know what it
 
Go look it up if you don't know what it
means. But what Kelly's saying is it
means. But what Kelly's saying is it
 
means. But what Kelly's saying is it
just doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter. And it
just doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter. And it
 
just doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter. And it
doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter because when the
doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter because when the
