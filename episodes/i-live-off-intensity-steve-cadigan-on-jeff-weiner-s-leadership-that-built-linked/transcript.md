For today's Essential Heretics 101
feature, we talked to Steve Katigan,
LinkedIn's first hired CHRO. Steve
dissects LinkedIn's hyperrowth
challenges, contrarian HR principles,
and the fundamental shift from acquiring
to developing talent internally. Hey
everybody, welcome back to the HR
Heretics podcast.
&gt;&gt; Today we have Steve Katigan on the show.
Steve was the CHRO at LinkedIn from 400
to 4,000 employees.
&gt;&gt; Steve, welcome to the show. We're so
excited to have you.
&gt;&gt; So great to be here. I'm looking forward
to this.
&gt;&gt; I think conventional wisdom in HR is to
be really fluffy, to not say anything
like controversial.
And so what we've been hearing from our
listeners so far as it relates to
feedback is they want to hear you get
into like the meaty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of what you've
seen in your career, the stuff that you
haven't talked about and the stuff that
other people aren't talking about
publicly. I I think I built a career I
believe that uh I broke more policies
than I made and um non-traditional and
so you know that's more fun to me
solving problems than being HR and uh
it's such a weird weird profession from
the standpoint of it's highly
relationship based there is no
accreditation.
&gt;&gt; All right I want to jump into LinkedIn.
So, you were at LinkedIn from 400
employees to 4,000 employees. And the
interesting thing for me about LinkedIn
is it wasn't considered sexy like Google
and Facebook back in the day, but it
actually was known for having an amazing
culture and then ultimately had a
massive exit to Microsoft.
How did you guys do it? I can't tell you
uh what a great opportunity it was on
one level to be do practicing HR in a
company whose main product is HR whose
main customer is HR. Our biggest problem
as a company was recruiting people and
our biggest product was selling
recruiting. And if our customers knew at
that point we had no idea why we weren't
more effective um I think it really
would have harmed us. We were surrounded
by Google and their daycare centers and
their sushi chefs and their fancy buses.
We had to go over new hire orientation,
how to avoid getting hit by the Google
buses walking to the buildings. So, it
was really, really hard. And so,
finally, we have a moment of truth as an
executive team where I sit around and
say, "Guys,
&gt;&gt; we really got nothing here." And our
decline rate was off the charts scary. I
mean, something like 40% offer
acceptance rate. So um that was the
moment of truth where we finally asked
the question which every company should
ask which is so elemental but so
profound. Why would anyone want to work
here? And the reason we never asked the
question is we just assume cuz we're
nice, people are number one, you know,
we're great. And what a candidate hears
when you say that is blah blah blah blah
blah. We have a problem we're solving.
Helping people find their dream jobs. No
one can touch that. That is really
beautiful. It's better than selling
DVDs. It's better than helping kids
develop their short attention span
capability over there at Facebook. Uh
and if you have the opportunity to do
this as a company, I would highly
recommend that you really leverage it,
which was we said, what asset do we
have, you know, so why would you want to
work here? Okay, answer problem we're
solving. Second thing is, what assets do
we have to really differentiate oursel
in a very, you know, candy store career,
you know, of Silicon Valley? Like it's a
career candy store. And we said,"Well,
we can't pay people more. We don't have
all these things, but we can make
working here the most learning rich
experience of your lifetime." And then
someone said, it wasn't me. Someone
said, and by the way, we're the
professional network. Shouldn't we be
the best place for professionals? Steve,
you said something that I thought I've
felt in my own career and I think a lot
of folks maybe on the line are feeling
and maybe they're the founders are the
one the ones that are imprinting this on
them, but you said, you know, I got
there and they didn't like HR. Can you
unpack like when that moment for you
happened at LinkedIn and how that
worked?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. I knew in the interview
process, okay, these people don't know
what HR can do. If I take a look at HR
in general, you are serving two things
primarily at the end of the day.
Judgment and credibility. Those are your
products. Okay? And the best way to
realize whether your judgment matters
and whether you have credibility is to
deal with gnarly stuff quickly. Every
executive is asking, "Can I trust you?"
And they're going to set you, they're
going to put you in situations where
they're going to tell you something and
they're going to see if you're going to
run to the CEO or the CFO or what you're
going to do. So, for example, in the
performance review discussion, they were
so ready to hear me say, "Oh, we have to
have performance reviews." Like, "Hey, I
hate performance reviews." And they're
like, "What?" I said, "Oh, yeah. I hate
it." I said, "Can you tell me the moment
in your career that changed your life?
Was that great performance review that
you had?" It's like, "Has any executive
ever said that pivotal moment? Was that
great performance review I got?" No.
It's deflating. It's a horror show that
you're asking your leaders to go
through. And most people, especially in
Silicon Valley, have never been trained
on how to deliver this. really really
well. So, I'm like, "Yeah, I'm all in."

&gt;&gt; Jeff Jeff Weiner is a legendary CEO and
I have heard he can be a total [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
What was it like working with Jeff?
&gt;&gt; It was really intense. So, I'll give you
a great story. One day, I walk into
Jeff's office and um something really
bad had happened. We've been hacked by
some hackers and they stole passwords,
like millions of them. And this was a PR
nightmare. And Jeff was as calm as I've
ever seen him. He said, "Steve, you need
to understand something about me." And
I'm grateful this was early earlier in
our relationship. He said, "I live off
of intensity. And if people aren't as
intense as I am in the moment, I'm going
to create a situation that's going to
make them intense.
And so I'm like, whoa. So this moment is
really intense and you're just right in
your element. It's like this is it. And
he's like, yep. The second uh great
story about Jeff is we would have as an
executive team um employee surveys every
six months and everyone, every manager
would get the results. We would share as
a group what our scores were, what our
team thought of us, including Jeff who
whose results were those of us in the
room, like 12 of us. And every year for
like two and a half years, Jeff got the
lowest score among us of do you inspire
your team? Okay. And it was killing him.
So he pulls me in the office one day.
He's like, "Hey, for the last year, I
see this bulletin board right next to
me. He's like, it's been my number one
priority to inspire people. you know,
I'm just I'm at my wit's end. Like, what
what do you think I can do? And I said,
Jeff, let me ask you a question. And
this was one of those moments, my hair
is still rising in my arm just
remembering the story because it was
just so I was very proud of this moment.
I said, Jeff, when you meet with your
team, where do you meet with them? He
goes, "Right here in this office." I
said, "Okay, when you're meeting with
them, what's usually the issue?
Something going well or something
broken?" And he goes, "Oh, my job is
to." And he stopped right there and he
realized that office was a place where
bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was getting discussed and
uncomfortable stuff. And he's like, "Ah,
okay." And from that day forward, most
of his one-on- ones were walking around
outside in the building. It was never
there. And so Jeff became a master. And
the the part that I loved about working
with him is he learned so fast. Like I
didn't even have to get through. And the
second part of that story that of the
hacking incident in Jeff's I I believe
in his growth as a leader was he got in
front of the company and took full
ownership for that. He's like, I'm going
to fix this. This is on me. And he was
terrified. He's like, Steve, it's really
uncomfortable for me. He became
vulnerable for the first time. And guess
what happened? He got back to his office
and his email had never been more filled
with employees going, oh my god, I love
you. You're the best. and he saw, oh,
being vulnerable was really a superpower
that he'd never tested before, right?
And that was really cool. Those of the
listeners who are HR leaders who may be
struggling for, you know, for whatever
reason, uh, that's our destiny to be
struggling, I guess, all the time. I got
some I got some advice for you. You
don't own the you don't own HR. Your
leadership team does. Your job is to get
them to own it. So, I you know, you want
to make sure something doesn't work in a
company, make it an HR program. that's
like destined for failure. Don't get
your leadership team to advocate it. Get
in front of them. Help them, support
them, coach them. You as a leadership
team, you got to own this is our
company. You don't want to you don't
want me to bureaucratize some sort of
system that you guys don't like. Like
let's do this together. And I think
that's where some of the insecurities of
people who feel like I need to have my
FIFA in HR. We need to operate in a
black box. That's just a failed
strategy. I love in your book, Steve,
you talked about those serendipitous
moments of you never know who you're
going to meet and where and it creates
different opportunities. The same thing
happens at work, right, with colleagues
and the distributed remote nature of
things kind of makes that more difficult
and I I just would love your take on how
do you counsel organizations to try and
create those as much as possible?
&gt;&gt; We don't know yet. Honestly, we are, you
know, this is the hardest part for most
of the business leaders that I talk to
around the world and this the biggest
question which is, "Hey, Steve, who's
doing this right?" I go, "Nobody." And
every time in life when we face
something hard, what do we do? Let's go
benchmark. Who's the benchmark? I go,
"It's time to be the benchmark." And so
they say, "Steve, stay at home, hybrid,
you know, remote." And I say, "Yes." And
they go, "No, no, we're asking you which
one." I go, "Yes."
I said, "You're going to have to try."
Every CEO who's never done remote at the
scale we're doing now is knows what the
outcomes are when we work together. They
have no idea what the long-term outcome
is when we're remote. So, they're
scared. They're scared. I want to talk
about blitzcaling. You were essentially
head of blit scaling at LinkedIn. It's
never that clean internally and I'm just
I want to get your take on what didn't
go well with blitz scaling at LinkedIn
and what you learned about that.
biggest uh mistake I have for you is at
some point we realized, hey, I think
we're g we're going to make this thing.
And so, let's go uh look around the
table. Has anyone here run a billion
dollar business? And the answer was,
nope, not even close. So, well, let's go
get some people who run a billion dollar
business who can teach us and show us
the way. So, we did. We went out and got
two hires in different parts of the
business, marketing and sales that had
led, you know, billion-dollar
portfolios. And they both failed
miserably.
And they failed because they didn't
build a billion-dollar industry. They
just led a billion dollar industry. So
they would come in and say, "Okay,
where's my six admins?" And uh, you
know, then we can get going. We're like,
"We don't have admins here, you know,
and if we do, they're shared by three
executives. like what are you talking
about? And they were just paralyzed in
fear of how chaotic things were and so
you know that's when we realized at that
early phase blitzkilling you really need
builders man you need people that just
groove off of crazy that realize this
highest source of energy in the universe
is chaos and that can be a good thing
and they they are good people at
bringing order from nothing. the hiring
builders versus hiring people who
inherited the business at scale is such
an interesting lens. How did you guys
figure that out? Like how did you
actually like assess for builders and
because a lot of people who have done
this never want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it again?
I used to go into my one-on- ones with
Jeff and say, "Do you hear that sound?"
He goes, "What's that?" I go, "Those are
all the balls I'm dropping right now."
as a perfectionist, as someone who
really has a, you know, a high, you
know, self-confidence, I don't want to
let someone else do my I want to do my
stuff. And my biggest problem was, you
know, saying no. You know,
&gt;&gt; Steve, you you mentioned it's actually a
great time to be in this business,
right? That it's it's blank slate. It's
new practices, not best practices, but
yet you got you would never do it again
till hell froze over. What why is that?
And because I'm hearing that from a lot
of HR leaders, I don't want to go back
in that seat. What is that phenomenon?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's, you know, honestly,
if I'm honest, I'm like, I fear I fear
myself. I really fear myself. Like I am
not good at saying no. Haven't haven't
been. I've gotten better over time. Um
I'm a perfectionist. I take take a lot
on and I don't miss that. I don't miss
And here's the the the biggest heartache
I had over that experience for me was
having three young kids. when I was
home, I wasn't home.
And uh I what broke it for me that led
to my final, you know, decision to go.
It was a Friday and my son uh it was the
fall and it was like trick-or- treat or
something coming up and he's like
Friday. He's like, "Dad, are you going
to be home early tonight?" And I said,
"Oh yeah." He goes, "8 nyear-old."
 
I'm like, "Oh my gosh, what have I
done?" Right? And so I had an enormous
parental guilt, but it's like I've I've
done that and I will coach anyone who's
in that situation. I got you. Um, but
no, I'm not ready for full full-time.
&gt;&gt; And so the last thing I want to ask you
is do you have advice for our audience?
&gt;&gt; Advice I have for leaders is recognize
that learning and growth is part of the
new compensation stack of the future of
work. And I'm not talking about classes
with your professors from MIT, Stanford,
Cal. talking about new assignments, new
experiences, new opportunities. Enroll
will unlock energy that will get the
work not to feel like work. As Simon
says, you know, it's all about the why
and it's all about the how. So, we are
increasingly finding that to find
qualified people is increasingly
impossible. We I began my career, you
don't hire someone unless you're 95%
qualified. Today, I think we're around
 
that gap? You're going to re-engineer
the job so I don't need that extra 30
 
fill it by moving people around. We're
going to have to move from a buy talent
economy to a bill talent economy. That
is the future. So as you're thinking
about how to lay the foundations, don't
be so worried about I don't have all the
experience I need. You want that
experience because you want to
accelerate your opportunity to, you
know, to thrive, but you also uh want it
because you don't know how to grow
people. you know how to develop people.
And if you can get comfortable with
that, that's going to lower your risk of
not being able to recruit so well
because that experienced talent pool is
never going to come back, I believe, in
this economy right now.
&gt;&gt; Amen, Steve. So great. Thank you so much
for the time.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Steve.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.
