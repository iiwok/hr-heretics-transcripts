&gt;&gt; All right I want to jump into LinkedIn.
So, you were at LinkedIn from 400
 
So, you were at LinkedIn from 400
employees to 4,000 employees. And the
 
employees to 4,000 employees. And the
interesting thing for me about LinkedIn
 
interesting thing for me about LinkedIn
is it wasn't considered sexy like Google
 
is it wasn't considered sexy like Google
and Facebook back in the day, but it
 
and Facebook back in the day, but it
actually was known for having an amazing
 
actually was known for having an amazing
culture and then ultimately had a
 
culture and then ultimately had a
massive exit to Microsoft.
 
massive exit to Microsoft.
How did you guys do it? I can't tell you
 
How did you guys do it? I can't tell you
uh what a great opportunity it was on
 
uh what a great opportunity it was on
one level to be do practicing HR in a
 
one level to be do practicing HR in a
company whose main product is HR whose
 
company whose main product is HR whose
main customer is HR. Our biggest problem
 
main customer is HR. Our biggest problem
as a company was recruiting people and
 
as a company was recruiting people and
our biggest product was selling
 
our biggest product was selling
recruiting. And if our customers knew at
 
recruiting. And if our customers knew at
that point we had no idea why we weren't
 
that point we had no idea why we weren't
more effective um I think it really
 
more effective um I think it really
would have harmed us. We were surrounded
 
would have harmed us. We were surrounded
by Google and their daycare centers and
 
by Google and their daycare centers and
their sushi chefs and their fancy buses.
 
their sushi chefs and their fancy buses.
We had to go over new hire orientation,
 
We had to go over new hire orientation,
how to avoid getting hit by the Google
 
how to avoid getting hit by the Google
buses walking to the buildings. So, it
 
buses walking to the buildings. So, it
was really, really hard. And so,
 
was really, really hard. And so,
finally, we have a moment of truth as an
 
finally, we have a moment of truth as an
executive team where I sit around and
 
executive team where I sit around and
say, "Guys,
 
say, "Guys,
&gt;&gt; we really got nothing here." And our
 
&gt;&gt; we really got nothing here." And our
decline rate was off the charts scary. I
 
decline rate was off the charts scary. I
mean, something like 40% offer
 
mean, something like 40% offer
acceptance rate. So um that was the
 
acceptance rate. So um that was the
moment of truth where we finally asked
 
moment of truth where we finally asked
the question which every company should
 
the question which every company should
ask which is so elemental but so
 
ask which is so elemental but so
profound. Why would anyone want to work
 
profound. Why would anyone want to work
here? And the reason we never asked the
 
here? And the reason we never asked the
question is we just assume cuz we're
 
question is we just assume cuz we're
nice, people are number one, you know,
 
nice, people are number one, you know,
we're great. And what a candidate hears
 
we're great. And what a candidate hears
when you say that is blah blah blah blah
 
when you say that is blah blah blah blah
blah. We have a problem we're solving.
 
blah. We have a problem we're solving.
Helping people find their dream jobs. No
 
Helping people find their dream jobs. No
one can touch that. That is really
 
one can touch that. That is really
beautiful. It's better than selling
 
beautiful. It's better than selling
DVDs. It's better than helping kids
 
DVDs. It's better than helping kids
develop their short attention span
 
develop their short attention span
capability over there at Facebook. Uh
 
capability over there at Facebook. Uh
and if you have the opportunity to do
 
and if you have the opportunity to do
this as a company, I would highly
 
this as a company, I would highly
recommend that you really leverage it,
 
recommend that you really leverage it,
which was we said, what asset do we
 
which was we said, what asset do we
have, you know, so why would you want to
 
have, you know, so why would you want to
work here? Okay, answer problem we're
 
work here? Okay, answer problem we're
solving. Second thing is, what assets do
 
solving. Second thing is, what assets do

in a very, you know, candy store career,
you know, of Silicon Valley? Like it's a
 
you know, of Silicon Valley? Like it's a
career candy store. And we said,"Well,
 
career candy store. And we said,"Well,

someone said, it wasn't me. Someone
said, and by the way, we're the
 
said, and by the way, we're the
professional network. Shouldn't we be

felt in my own career and I think a lot
of folks maybe on the line are feeling
 
of folks maybe on the line are feeling
and maybe they're the founders are the
 
and maybe they're the founders are the

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. I knew in the interview
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. I knew in the interview
process, okay, these people don't know
 
process, okay, these people don't know
what HR can do. If I take a look at HR
 
what HR can do. If I take a look at HR
in general, you are serving two things
 
in general, you are serving two things
primarily at the end of the day.
 
primarily at the end of the day.
Judgment and credibility. Those are your
 
Judgment and credibility. Those are your
products. Okay? And the best way to
 
products. Okay? And the best way to
realize whether your judgment matters
 
realize whether your judgment matters
and whether you have credibility is to
 
and whether you have credibility is to
deal with gnarly stuff quickly. Every
 
deal with gnarly stuff quickly. Every
executive is asking, "Can I trust you?"
 
executive is asking, "Can I trust you?"
And they're going to set you, they're
 
And they're going to set you, they're
going to put you in situations where
 
going to put you in situations where
they're going to tell you something and
 
they're going to tell you something and
they're going to see if you're going to
 
they're going to see if you're going to
run to the CEO or the CFO or what you're
 
run to the CEO or the CFO or what you're
going to do. So, for example, in the
 
going to do. So, for example, in the
performance review discussion, they were
 
performance review discussion, they were
so ready to hear me say, "Oh, we have to
 
so ready to hear me say, "Oh, we have to
have performance reviews." Like, "Hey, I
 
have performance reviews." Like, "Hey, I
hate performance reviews." And they're
 
hate performance reviews." And they're
like, "What?" I said, "Oh, yeah. I hate
 
like, "What?" I said, "Oh, yeah. I hate
it." I said, "Can you tell me the moment
 
it." I said, "Can you tell me the moment
in your career that changed your life?
 
in your career that changed your life?
Was that great performance review that
 
Was that great performance review that
you had?" It's like, "Has any executive
 
you had?" It's like, "Has any executive
ever said that pivotal moment? Was that
 
ever said that pivotal moment? Was that
great performance review I got?" No.
 
great performance review I got?" No.
It's deflating. It's a horror show that
 
It's deflating. It's a horror show that
you're asking your leaders to go
 
you're asking your leaders to go

through. And most people, especially in
Silicon Valley, have never been trained
 
Silicon Valley, have never been trained
on how to deliver this. really really
 
on how to deliver this. really really

people who feel like I need to have my
 
people who feel like I need to have my
FIFA in HR. We need to operate in a
 
FIFA in HR. We need to operate in a
black box. That's just a failed
 
black box. That's just a failed
strategy. I love in your book, Steve,

you talked about those serendipitous
 
you talked about those serendipitous
moments of you never know who you're
 
moments of you never know who you're
going to meet and where and it creates
 
going to meet and where and it creates
different opportunities. The same thing
 
different opportunities. The same thing
happens at work, right, with colleagues
 
happens at work, right, with colleagues
and the distributed remote nature of
 
and the distributed remote nature of
things kind of makes that more difficult
 
things kind of makes that more difficult
and I I just would love your take on how
 
and I I just would love your take on how
do you counsel organizations to try and
 
do you counsel organizations to try and
create those as much as possible?
 
create those as much as possible?
&gt;&gt; We don't know yet. Honestly, we are, you
 
&gt;&gt; We don't know yet. Honestly, we are, you
know, this is the hardest part for most
 
know, this is the hardest part for most
of the business leaders that I talk to
 
of the business leaders that I talk to
around the world and this the biggest
 
around the world and this the biggest
question which is, "Hey, Steve, who's
 
question which is, "Hey, Steve, who's
doing this right?" I go, "Nobody." And
 
doing this right?" I go, "Nobody." And
every time in life when we face
 
every time in life when we face
something hard, what do we do? Let's go
 
something hard, what do we do? Let's go
benchmark. Who's the benchmark? I go,
 
benchmark. Who's the benchmark? I go,
"It's time to be the benchmark." And so
 
"It's time to be the benchmark." And so
they say, "Steve, stay at home, hybrid,
 
they say, "Steve, stay at home, hybrid,
you know, remote." And I say, "Yes." And
 
you know, remote." And I say, "Yes." And
they go, "No, no, we're asking you which
 
they go, "No, no, we're asking you which
one." I go, "Yes."
 
one." I go, "Yes."
I said, "You're going to have to try."
 
I said, "You're going to have to try."
Every CEO who's never done remote at the
 
Every CEO who's never done remote at the
scale we're doing now is knows what the
 
scale we're doing now is knows what the
outcomes are when we work together. They
 
outcomes are when we work together. They
have no idea what the long-term outcome
 
have no idea what the long-term outcome
is when we're remote. So, they're
 
is when we're remote. So, they're
scared. They're scared. I want to talk
 
scared. They're scared. I want to talk
about blitzcaling. You were essentially
 
about blitzcaling. You were essentially
head of blit scaling at LinkedIn. It's
 
head of blit scaling at LinkedIn. It's
never that clean internally and I'm just
 
never that clean internally and I'm just
I want to get your take on what didn't
 
I want to get your take on what didn't
go well with blitz scaling at LinkedIn
 
go well with blitz scaling at LinkedIn
