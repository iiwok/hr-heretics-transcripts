going to sign a proclamation, in many
ways a directive to have the USCIS and
 
ways a directive to have the USCIS and
the relevant stakeholder immigration
 
the relevant stakeholder immigration
agency assess this $100,000
 
agency assess this $100,000
fee on H1B petitions. And I think what
 
fee on H1B petitions. And I think what
made it seismic is that there were a lot
 
made it seismic is that there were a lot
of comments on a live stream that made
 
of comments on a live stream that made
people fear that it applied in a lot of
 
people fear that it applied in a lot of
different circumstances that made it
 
different circumstances that made it
seem that if you had an H-1B employee,
 
seem that if you had an H-1B employee,
you were immediately going to be
 
you were immediately going to be
assessed this $100,000 invoice, so to
 
assessed this $100,000 invoice, so to
speak. But that's basically what
 
speak. But that's basically what
happened is that they signed this into
 
happened is that they signed this into
effect that night. And then since then,
 
effect that night. And then since then,

So, we're recording this. It's Monday,
September 22nd at 300 p.m. Pacific time.
 
September 22nd at 300 p.m. Pacific time.
What do we know today? Like, what are
 
What do we know today? Like, what are
the facts today?
 
the facts today?
&gt;&gt; So, I'll tell you what we do have. We
 
&gt;&gt; So, I'll tell you what we do have. We
have a written proclamation that was
 
have a written proclamation that was
signed by President Trump on Friday that
 
signed by President Trump on Friday that
explained that we need to start
 
explained that we need to start
assessing this $100,000 fee on H1B
 
assessing this $100,000 fee on H1B
petitions and that potentially the
 
petitions and that potentially the
Secretary of Homeland Security can label
 
Secretary of Homeland Security can label
what exemptions occur for this
 
what exemptions occur for this
particular fee. Thereafter, we had
 
particular fee. Thereafter, we had
guidances that were issued in two main
 
guidances that were issued in two main
formats or two buckets of formats. We
 
formats or two buckets of formats. We
had the press secretary of the United
 
had the press secretary of the United
States and the rapid response team
 
States and the rapid response team
representing the president of the United
 
representing the president of the United
States publishing on X, formerly known
 
States publishing on X, formerly known
as Twitter, tweets that basically
 
as Twitter, tweets that basically
expressed, hey, these things may not
 
expressed, hey, these things may not
necessarily apply to every single H1B.
 
necessarily apply to every single H1B.
It's not going to be quote unquote an
 
It's not going to be quote unquote an
annual fee, but a one-time fee on a new
 
annual fee, but a one-time fee on a new
petition. And then we also got published
 
petition. And then we also got published
guidance from USCIS and CBP, Customs and
 
guidance from USCIS and CBP, Customs and
Border Patrol, on how they would be
 
Border Patrol, on how they would be
adjudicating some of these applications
 
adjudicating some of these applications
moving forward. But I think the one
 
moving forward. But I think the one
thing that I have to express to every
 
thing that I have to express to every
single person who's listening to this
 
single person who's listening to this
particular podcast and this episode is
 
particular podcast and this episode is
that where we're at today is that there
 
that where we're at today is that there
are some things that are very clear and
 
are some things that are very clear and
then there are some things that are not
 
then there are some things that are not
that clear.
 
that clear.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So can you get into the very clear
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So can you get into the very clear
and not very clear so people can better
 
and not very clear so people can better
understand?
 
understand?
&gt;&gt; For sure. So what is very clear is that
 
&gt;&gt; For sure. So what is very clear is that
individuals who are exempted from this
 
individuals who are exempted from this
fee include people who filed a pending
 
fee include people who filed a pending
application prior to September 21st of
 
application prior to September 21st of
 
have a currently valid approved petition
 
have a currently valid approved petition
that was approved prior to that date in
 
that was approved prior to that date in
addition to individuals who are
 
addition to individuals who are
currently holding valid H1B visas. And
 
currently holding valid H1B visas. And
they used or statements for a lot of
 
they used or statements for a lot of
these things. So it's if you have one of
 
these things. So it's if you have one of
those three things, you are currently
 
those three things, you are currently
exempted from having to pay that fee.
 
exempted from having to pay that fee.
and the government has made it clear
 
and the government has made it clear
that you don't necessarily need to be
 
that you don't necessarily need to be
running over the hills to come back to
 
running over the hills to come back to
the United States if you have one of
 
the United States if you have one of
those three things. That could still
 
those three things. That could still
differ from what my personal advice
 
differ from what my personal advice
would be for every single employee or
 
would be for every single employee or
every single person who is operating or
 
every single person who is operating or
overseeing these programs, but that has
 
overseeing these programs, but that has
been made extremely clear. The other
 
been made extremely clear. The other
thing that we know for a fact that is
 
thing that we know for a fact that is
out there that the government has made
 
out there that the government has made
clear is that for sure next year's
 
clear is that for sure next year's
lottery for March of 2026 is when a lot
 
lottery for March of 2026 is when a lot
of these fees are going to definitely be
 
of these fees are going to definitely be
in effect. They're saying that if you
 
in effect. They're saying that if you
are a new applicant and you have won
 
are a new applicant and you have won
that H1B lottery, chances are you're
 
that H1B lottery, chances are you're
going to be paying this $100,000
 
going to be paying this $100,000
fee.
 
fee.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um and then what's left unclear,
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um and then what's left unclear,
&gt;&gt; right? So two things that are definitely
 
&gt;&gt; right? So two things that are definitely
on the top of people's mind. Let's start
 
on the top of people's mind. Let's start
with the easy one, the exemptions.
 
with the easy one, the exemptions.
Right? So in the written proclamation,
 
Right? So in the written proclamation,
the government says like, "Hey,
 
the government says like, "Hey,
Secretary of Homeland Security, you can
 
Secretary of Homeland Security, you can
make the judgment call of what
 
make the judgment call of what
industries and what companies are
 
industries and what companies are
exempted from this fee." And I feel like
 
exempted from this fee." And I feel like
that's a very significant carve out, but
 
that's a very significant carve out, but
we don't actually know what those carve
 
we don't actually know what those carve
arts are going to be. Is it that they're
 
arts are going to be. Is it that they're
going to say, "Hey, if you're in health
 
going to say, "Hey, if you're in health
care or if you're a physician or if
 
care or if you're a physician or if
you're what is known as a capex exempt
 
you're what is known as a capex exempt
H-1B, like you have this company that is
 
H-1B, like you have this company that is
exempted from doing the lottery process
 
exempted from doing the lottery process
like a university or a college if
 
like a university or a college if
they're going to be exempted because
 
they're going to be exempted because
that's kind of the inclination or the
 
that's kind of the inclination or the
insinuation of that particular carve
 
insinuation of that particular carve
out. But we don't know. We still don't
 
out. But we don't know. We still don't
know who is exempted completely in that
 
know who is exempted completely in that
type of mechanism. The second thing that
 
type of mechanism. The second thing that
we also are unclear about is the way
 
we also are unclear about is the way
that USCIS described who doesn't count,
 
that USCIS described who doesn't count,
which is this whole H-1B renewal
 
which is this whole H-1B renewal
concept. USCIS in their guidance
 
concept. USCIS in their guidance
basically said, hey, if you are doing an
 
basically said, hey, if you are doing an
H-1B renewal, you don't need to pay this
 
H-1B renewal, you don't need to pay this
fee. But what is the definition of a
 
fee. But what is the definition of a
renewal? So, for us here as
 
renewal? So, for us here as
practitioners that deal a lot with
 
practitioners that deal a lot with
H-1Bs, a renewal can mean many different
 
H-1Bs, a renewal can mean many different
things. Is it that I'm filing to change
 
things. Is it that I'm filing to change
employers? I'm currently working for one
 
employers? I'm currently working for one
company. I'm transferring to a different
 
company. I'm transferring to a different
company. I'm now asking for an extension
 
company. I'm now asking for an extension
because I am doing this transfer. Is
 
because I am doing this transfer. Is
that a renewal? Or is it that I'm
 
that a renewal? Or is it that I'm
staying with the same company, right?
 
staying with the same company, right?
And I'm asking for an extension of my
 
And I'm asking for an extension of my
time to continue working for the same
 
time to continue working for the same
company. And it's because of all of
 
company. And it's because of all of
these things and this vagueness of the
 
these things and this vagueness of the
terminology of renewals that we actually
 
terminology of renewals that we actually
don't know if a transfer or a domestic
 
don't know if a transfer or a domestic
filing of that nature will be exempted
 
filing of that nature will be exempted
from these fees moving forward.
 
from these fees moving forward.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
 
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
 
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
 
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
 
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
 
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply, HR isn't about
 
put it so simply, HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
 
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
 
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
 
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
 
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
 
such a fan of what Melanie and her team

Is it fair to say based off of how the
 
Is it fair to say based off of how the
weekend ended up playing out that even
 
weekend ended up playing out that even
though we don't know for sure, what will
 
though we don't know for sure, what will
likely be the case is that transfers
 
likely be the case is that transfers
will not have this fee applied to it and
 
will not have this fee applied to it and
that it will be more of the net new
 
that it will be more of the net new
H-1Bs.
 
H-1Bs.
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I would say that
 
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I would say that
confidently to be honest with you
 
confidently to be honest with you
because like it's very interesting that
 
because like it's very interesting that
they decided to use the term renewal.
 
they decided to use the term renewal.
They could have made it a lot more
 
They could have made it a lot more
clear, let's say, in terms of saying
 
clear, let's say, in terms of saying
like, hey, it's only for what we call
 
like, hey, it's only for what we call
new employment applications. There's a
 
new employment applications. There's a
specific checkbox that we can mark off
 
specific checkbox that we can mark off
on the forms. But, you know, technically
 
on the forms. But, you know, technically
a transfer, especially if you're
 
a transfer, especially if you're
changing companies, could be considered
 
changing companies, could be considered
new employment, right? It could be
 
new employment, right? It could be
considered a new petition. So, I don't
 
considered a new petition. So, I don't
think I would say just straight up that
 
think I would say just straight up that
like, hey, I think the end result is
 
like, hey, I think the end result is
that transfers won't count. I actually
 
that transfers won't count. I actually
think it's better and more conservative
 
think it's better and more conservative
to assume that transfers will count and
 
to assume that transfers will count and
will not be exempted and will need to
 
will not be exempted and will need to
pay that particular fee.
 
pay that particular fee.
&gt;&gt; That's interesting. Okay. I'm assuming
 
&gt;&gt; That's interesting. Okay. I'm assuming
Sunday then was like the first time when
 
Sunday then was like the first time when
enforcement started happening on some of
 
enforcement started happening on some of
this stuff. Like did you see anything in
 
this stuff. Like did you see anything in
enforcement on Sunday that you think the
 
enforcement on Sunday that you think the
audience should know about? Well, that's
 
audience should know about? Well, that's
the curious thing is that I didn't
 
the curious thing is that I didn't
really see much on enforcement, but
 
really see much on enforcement, but
there were people who traveled after
 
there were people who traveled after
 
who traveled into the country
 
who traveled into the country
successfully have been the individuals
 
successfully have been the individuals
that qualify for those three examples
 
that qualify for those three examples
that I gave earlier, which is that you
 
that I gave earlier, which is that you
already had an approved petition before
 
already had an approved petition before
that date. You already had a valid um
 
that date. You already had a valid um
H-1B visa before that date or you had at
 
H-1B visa before that date or you had at
minimum a pending application and you
 
minimum a pending application and you
were coming back whether it's on a
 
were coming back whether it's on a
different visa or based on the fact that
 
different visa or based on the fact that
you had a timely filed extension. So all
 
you had a timely filed extension. So all
of this is to say that I haven't seen
 
of this is to say that I haven't seen
push back. I haven't seen somebody not
 
push back. I haven't seen somebody not
be able to enter since then, but I think
 
be able to enter since then, but I think
we have very little information because
 
we have very little information because
only a day has really passed by and
 
only a day has really passed by and
people were so cautious that they would
 
people were so cautious that they would
rather not risk even traveling into the
 
rather not risk even traveling into the
country if they didn't qualify under one
 
country if they didn't qualify under one
of those three things so far.
 
of those three things so far.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. I saw an X on Friday
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. I saw an X on Friday
night or Saturday, an Emirates flight to
 
night or Saturday, an Emirates flight to
where literally like people were like
 
where literally like people were like
trying to get off of the plane in SFO.
 
trying to get off of the plane in SFO.
uh which was just like a wild scene. So,
 
uh which was just like a wild scene. So,
here's how I'm thinking about this. All
 
here's how I'm thinking about this. All
right. Again, it's Monday. I have a lot
 
right. Again, it's Monday. I have a lot
of friends who I've been talking to this
 
of friends who I've been talking to this
weekend. Um and I think there's a
 
weekend. Um and I think there's a
there's a number of topics for us to
 
there's a number of topics for us to
discuss, but the first one I want to
 
discuss, but the first one I want to
discuss is like if I was one of these
 
discuss is like if I was one of these
people running an immigration program
 
people running an immigration program
moving forward, here's what I would do,
 
moving forward, here's what I would do,

would do an immediate audit of every
candidate in the pipeline to understand
 
candidate in the pipeline to understand
if any of those candidates are on H-1B.
 
if any of those candidates are on H-1B.
And then what I would do is I would say,
 
And then what I would do is I would say,
okay, we're going to put these people on
 
okay, we're going to put these people on
pause except for very special
 
pause except for very special
circumstances in which like we can
 
circumstances in which like we can
fasttrack somebody through if we needed
 
fasttrack somebody through if we needed
to. The reason being
 
to. The reason being
I think the administration has made very
 
I think the administration has made very
clear that H-1B is going to be a target
 
clear that H-1B is going to be a target
and we already you know most of the
 
and we already you know most of the
people who are listening to this show if
 
people who are listening to this show if
you're thinking about this problem you
 
you're thinking about this problem you
probably already have folks on H-1B uh
 
probably already have folks on H-1B uh
as employees and so for me the first
 
as employees and so for me the first
thing I would want to do is not make
 
thing I would want to do is not make
that problem any bigger. That would be
 
that problem any bigger. That would be
thing one. Thing two would be starting
 
thing one. Thing two would be starting
to explore other options that you know
 
to explore other options that you know
traditionally maybe we haven't explored.
 
traditionally maybe we haven't explored.
So for example like 01 EB1 those sorts
 
So for example like 01 EB1 those sorts
of things. Nicole what's your feedback
 
of things. Nicole what's your feedback
for me on that potential path forward.
 
for me on that potential path forward.
So, I will say that I agree with you
 
So, I will say that I agree with you
that an immediate audit needs to happen.
 
that an immediate audit needs to happen.
And I wouldn't be surprised if at
 
And I wouldn't be surprised if at
minimum some really great immigration
 
minimum some really great immigration
practices have already reached out
 
practices have already reached out
proactively to their clients saying,
 
proactively to their clients saying,
"Let's put together this Excel sheet or
 
"Let's put together this Excel sheet or
I already have a report of a list of all
 
I already have a report of a list of all
of your candidates or all of your
 
of your candidates or all of your
employees who are on this status and how
 
employees who are on this status and how
they could be affected." Right? I do
 
they could be affected." Right? I do
think that a lot of it is going to be a
 
think that a lot of it is going to be a
case-byase analysis. Where are they in
 
case-byase analysis. Where are they in
the pipeline? Are they abroad? Are they
 
the pipeline? Are they abroad? Are they
even in the United States? What
 
even in the United States? What
nationality are they in? So, I 100%
 
nationality are they in? So, I 100%
agree with you that an immediate audit
 
agree with you that an immediate audit
needs to happen. And I also agree with
 
needs to happen. And I also agree with
you that the conversation about
 
you that the conversation about
alternate plans and being able to
 
alternate plans and being able to
present within the company to relevant
 
present within the company to relevant
stakeholders that hey, if the H-1B
 
stakeholders that hey, if the H-1B
really does collapse and we already know
 
really does collapse and we already know
that it's going to be the focus and
 
that it's going to be the focus and
attention of the current administration,
 
attention of the current administration,
what do these alternatives look like?
 
what do these alternatives look like?
because I don't necessarily see a
 
because I don't necessarily see a
universe where there's completely zero
 
universe where there's completely zero
immigration. There will always be a need
 
immigration. There will always be a need
to rely to some degree with foreign
 
to rely to some degree with foreign
talent or the ability to just bring
 
talent or the ability to just bring
someone from outside who has a very
 
someone from outside who has a very
specific skill set, especially in an
 
specific skill set, especially in an
innovation forward economy like ours
 
innovation forward economy like ours
here in the United States.
 
here in the United States.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's talk about some of these
 
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's talk about some of these
alternatives.
 
alternatives.
Like I think you know when we were
 
Like I think you know when we were
talking before we started recording you
 
talking before we started recording you
called it the alphabet soup uh of
 
called it the alphabet soup uh of
immigration. So what do these things
 
immigration. So what do these things
mean? What are the likelihood that we
 
mean? What are the likelihood that we
can take somebody that's on an H1B and
 
can take somebody that's on an H1B and
put them through one of these different
 
put them through one of these different
paths? And what are you recommending to
 
paths? And what are you recommending to
your clients today?
 
your clients today?
&gt;&gt; Right. So I'll break it down into like
 
&gt;&gt; Right. So I'll break it down into like
let's call it three buckets of
 
let's call it three buckets of
alternative plans. And when I say it's
 
alternative plans. And when I say it's
the alphabet suit is because they
 
the alphabet suit is because they
literally use all of these letters and
 
literally use all of these letters and
numbers. It just does feel like an
 
numbers. It just does feel like an
alphabet soup of different visas. But
 
alphabet soup of different visas. But
the first bucket that I try to think of
 
the first bucket that I try to think of
because it's usually like the fastest
 
because it's usually like the fastest
has to do with what we call
 
has to do with what we call
countryspecific
 
countryspecific
visas, right? And the reason why I say
 
visas, right? And the reason why I say
that they're called country specific
 
that they're called country specific
visas is because if you have a candidate
 
visas is because if you have a candidate
who was swapped into an H-1B or was on
 
who was swapped into an H-1B or was on
an H-1B and they were here from
 
an H-1B and they were here from
Australia, they were a national of
 
Australia, they were a national of
Australia or they're a national of
 
Australia or they're a national of
Canada or Mexico. Swapping those
 
Canada or Mexico. Swapping those
individuals to an E3 for Australian
 
individuals to an E3 for Australian
nationals is a little bit safer because
 
nationals is a little bit safer because
they're protected by a treaty between
 
they're protected by a treaty between
the United States and Australia. And
 
the United States and Australia. And
separately for Canadians and Mexicans,
 
separately for Canadians and Mexicans,
it's the same thing. they're protected
 
it's the same thing. they're protected
by the NAFTA agreement or the USMCA that
 
by the NAFTA agreement or the USMCA that
have established these pathways for
 
have established these pathways for
immigration to the United States or at
 
immigration to the United States or at
least work visas. So that's like a very
 
least work visas. So that's like a very
quick way because both of them usually
 
quick way because both of them usually
are faster at processing because they
 
are faster at processing because they
could be done domestically here in the
 
could be done domestically here in the
US or very quickly at a border or at a
 
US or very quickly at a border or at a
consulate at least for the TN in
 
consulate at least for the TN in
particular. But that's like a very quick
 
particular. But that's like a very quick
one. The second one is actually a little
 
one. The second one is actually a little
bit more interesting and much more
 
bit more interesting and much more
flexible for individuals who run STEM
 
flexible for individuals who run STEM
related organizations or what I call
 
related organizations or what I call
very innovative organizations and it's
 
very innovative organizations and it's
known as the J1 program. Many of you who
 
known as the J1 program. Many of you who
are listening to this podcast may have
 
are listening to this podcast may have
heard of the J1 whether it's through
 
heard of the J1 whether it's through
summer work travel like you know ski
 
summer work travel like you know ski
instructors or like people like running
 
instructors or like people like running
like the ski mountains in like Vermont
 
like the ski mountains in like Vermont
or you might have heard of the J1 intern
 
or you might have heard of the J1 intern
or trainee program where you have an
 
or trainee program where you have an
intern coming to the United States or a
 
intern coming to the United States or a
trainee who wants to just experience
 
trainee who wants to just experience
American culture or an American
 
American culture or an American
workplace culture for the first time.
 
workplace culture for the first time.
However, there are actually a lot of
 
However, there are actually a lot of
underutilized J1 programs that are very
 
underutilized J1 programs that are very
STEM initiative forward. And the main
 
STEM initiative forward. And the main
one that I want to talk about is the J1
 
one that I want to talk about is the J1
research scholar program, which grants
 
research scholar program, which grants
an individual a up to 5year work visa
 
an individual a up to 5year work visa
regardless of nationality and allows
 
regardless of nationality and allows
spouses to work in the United States.
 
spouses to work in the United States.
And when you hear the term research
 
And when you hear the term research
scholar, maybe some of you will
 
scholar, maybe some of you will
immediately think, isn't that only for
 
immediately think, isn't that only for
universities? Isn't that only for
 
universities? Isn't that only for
colleges? like you're a scholar, right?
 
colleges? like you're a scholar, right?
But the reality is that the definition
 
But the reality is that the definition
is very expansive. It just says, are you
 
is very expansive. It just says, are you
someone who is an expert in your field?
 
someone who is an expert in your field?
Let's say an engineer, right? Or a data
 
Let's say an engineer, right? Or a data
scientist. And are you contributing to
 
scientist. And are you contributing to
some level or consulting in some level
 
some level or consulting in some level
of research or innovation within your
 
of research or innovation within your
industry for this private organization.
 
industry for this private organization.
So if you are developing the latest and
 
So if you are developing the latest and
greatest of the next version of
 
greatest of the next version of
windmills that are out there to generate
 
windmills that are out there to generate
wind power or if you are designing what
 
wind power or if you are designing what
could be the future of digital banking
 
could be the future of digital banking
infrastructure. To be frank with you,
 
infrastructure. To be frank with you,
all of those things are very innovative
 
all of those things are very innovative
and require some level of research to
 
and require some level of research to
push those initiatives forward. So the
 
push those initiatives forward. So the
J1 research scholar program is actually
 
J1 research scholar program is actually
a really great alternative to some of
 
a really great alternative to some of
the programs that are out there. And
 
the programs that are out there. And
there's no lottery. you can immediately
 
there's no lottery. you can immediately
file for it and it's a relatively quick
 
file for it and it's a relatively quick
visa and it's something that a lot of
 
visa and it's something that a lot of
individuals have kind of missed out on
 
individuals have kind of missed out on
and really should be leveraging. And
 
and really should be leveraging. And
then there's like the third bucket of
 
then there's like the third bucket of
options here which is related to
 
options here which is related to
extraordinary ability or the 01 visa or
 
extraordinary ability or the 01 visa or
its bigger brother let's call it which
 
its bigger brother let's call it which
is the EB1A which is the green card
 
is the EB1A which is the green card
variation of it. Very quickly, the
 
variation of it. Very quickly, the
reason why I really want to touch upon
 
reason why I really want to touch upon
extraordinary ability visas is because I
 
extraordinary ability visas is because I
captured one thing from the Trump
 
captured one thing from the Trump
presentation when they were signing the
 
presentation when they were signing the
proclamation live on the live stream,
 
proclamation live on the live stream,
which is wording, right? Word choice
 
which is wording, right? Word choice
matters in my point of view. When you
 
matters in my point of view. When you
say things repeatedly, there's got to be
 
say things repeatedly, there's got to be
a reason for it. And in that
 
a reason for it. And in that
presentation, they kept on repeating, we
 
presentation, they kept on repeating, we
want the top talent to be rewarded. We
 
want the top talent to be rewarded. We
want to bring the best and the brightest
 
want to bring the best and the brightest
to the United States. So they're not
 
to the United States. So they're not
necessarily saying we don't want any
 
necessarily saying we don't want any
foreign workers. They just want to
 
foreign workers. They just want to
hyperfocus the immigration programs on
 
hyperfocus the immigration programs on
bringing quote unquote the best. And
 
bringing quote unquote the best. And
they use the term extraordinary ability
 
they use the term extraordinary ability
a lot during that conversation. So
 
a lot during that conversation. So
extraordinary ability is tied to the 01.
 
extraordinary ability is tied to the 01.
It's tied to the EB1A. So I can perceive
 
It's tied to the EB1A. So I can perceive
it in that all of the alphabet soup or
 
it in that all of the alphabet soup or
visas that are out there that the
 
visas that are out there that the
government may not necessarily be
 
government may not necessarily be
targeting and are trying to really
 
targeting and are trying to really
uplift it really would be these
 
uplift it really would be these
extraordinary ability visas that try to
 
extraordinary ability visas that try to
capture the best and the brightest of
 
capture the best and the brightest of
talent to the United States. And there
 
talent to the United States. And there
are ways for employers to support those
 
are ways for employers to support those
programs to support the ability to meet
 
programs to support the ability to meet
it. Some people think it's a very
 
it. Some people think it's a very
subjective visa, but take a look at the
 
subjective visa, but take a look at the
numbers. It has some of the highest
 
numbers. It has some of the highest
approval rates within the government.

you're looking at an above 90% approval

You guys put out an amazing memo this
 
You guys put out an amazing memo this
weekend. And the thing that I learned
 
weekend. And the thing that I learned
when that memo came out is that the 01
 
when that memo came out is that the 01
has a 94.5%
 
has a 94.5%
approval rate. Now, Nicole, I hear that
 
approval rate. Now, Nicole, I hear that
and I go, how is that possible? Right?
 
and I go, how is that possible? Right?
Like there's got to be fraud. Like that
 
Like there's got to be fraud. Like that
feels completely off to me. But I
 
feels completely off to me. But I
remember when we were at Door Dash, we
 
remember when we were at Door Dash, we
only had I think there was like one
 
only had I think there was like one
person on 01 and we were very judicious
 
person on 01 and we were very judicious
about who like we put down that path. So
 
about who like we put down that path. So
are you saying that you think there's a
 
are you saying that you think there's a
world to where like we can expand that
 
world to where like we can expand that
pool of people as long as there is the
 
pool of people as long as there is the
supplemental evidence?
 
supplemental evidence?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think there is a way. I
 
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think there is a way. I
think the reason why maybe right now the
 
think the reason why maybe right now the
approval rates are so high is because
 
approval rates are so high is because
people are judicious. But maybe it's
 
people are judicious. But maybe it's
because we've been limiting ourselves,
 
because we've been limiting ourselves,
right? Maybe it's because there's an
 
right? Maybe it's because there's an
over reliance on the traditional
 
over reliance on the traditional
playbook of how we deal with
 
playbook of how we deal with
immigration. But again, I think maybe
 
immigration. But again, I think maybe
it's like a selling point, right? which
 
it's like a selling point, right? which
is that the government would like to
 
is that the government would like to
say, hey, we tamped down and we shut
 
say, hey, we tamped down and we shut
down the H-1B program, but look at the
 
down the H-1B program, but look at the
uptick of extraordinary individuals that
 
uptick of extraordinary individuals that
we brought to the United States through
 
we brought to the United States through
this 01 mechanism, right? This feeling
 
this 01 mechanism, right? This feeling
of vetting through a very set rubric and
 
of vetting through a very set rubric and
criteria that can clearly be explained
 
criteria that can clearly be explained
as why this person is extraordinary. I
 
as why this person is extraordinary. I
think maybe what they're trying to move
 
think maybe what they're trying to move
towards. Can I prove it? No. But I
 
towards. Can I prove it? No. But I
really want to go back to what I said.
 
really want to go back to what I said.
Word choice matters. There's got to be a
 
Word choice matters. There's got to be a
reason why they kept on saying
 
reason why they kept on saying
extraordinary ability and top tier
 
extraordinary ability and top tier
talent. I think that's the direction
 
talent. I think that's the direction
that they're moving in.
 
that they're moving in.
&gt;&gt; Yep. So, I want to talk about this
 
&gt;&gt; Yep. So, I want to talk about this
debate that happened this weekend,
 
debate that happened this weekend,
right? There's the actual policy.
 
right? There's the actual policy.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
 
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And I think there's a there's a very
 
&gt;&gt; And I think there's a there's a very
large debate to be had here and you have
 
large debate to be had here and you have
on one side I think like the Gary Tans
 
on one side I think like the Gary Tans
of the world. So Gary Tan is the CEO of
 
of the world. So Gary Tan is the CEO of
Y Combinator and he put on X and on
 
Y Combinator and he put on X and on
LinkedIn this weekend a 100,000 H1B fee
 
LinkedIn this weekend a 100,000 H1B fee
won't bother big tech but it kneecaps
 
won't bother big tech but it kneecaps
startups and body shops the same and
 
startups and body shops the same and
that's a mistake. Early teams can't
 
that's a mistake. Early teams can't
swallow that tax. Body shops who abuse
 
swallow that tax. Body shops who abuse
H-1B should be stopped. There are ways
 
H-1B should be stopped. There are ways
to do that without entrenching big tech
 
to do that without entrenching big tech
and throttling startups.
 
and throttling startups.
So look, I've built these programs. Like
 
So look, I've built these programs. Like
I've seen the inside of like how this
 
I've seen the inside of like how this
stuff works and the reality we're
 
stuff works and the reality we're
talking about H1B here, right? I know
 
talking about H1B here, right? I know
most founders are on 01. To your point,
 
most founders are on 01. To your point,
more people are starting to think about
 
more people are starting to think about
 
Door Dash, we decided not to put anybody
 
Door Dash, we decided not to put anybody
through the lottery because it was such
 
through the lottery because it was such
a like the I think last year's numbers
 
a like the I think last year's numbers
was like 11% of people got drawn in the
 
was like 11% of people got drawn in the
lottery. And so if you're a startup, you
 
lottery. And so if you're a startup, you
already need a hundred miracles to go
 
already need a hundred miracles to go
your way. And so then you're you're
 
your way. And so then you're you're
going to tell me the next miracle that
 
going to tell me the next miracle that
you're going to try and take on is like,
 
you're going to try and take on is like,
oh, we're going to hire this person.
 
oh, we're going to hire this person.
We're going to try and like put them
 
We're going to try and like put them
through the lottery. Like my
 
through the lottery. Like my
understanding, Nicole, is like this
 
understanding, Nicole, is like this
disproportionately affects growth stage
 
disproportionately affects growth stage
companies, later stage companies. Is
 
companies, later stage companies. Is
that true? Or do you see many earlier
 
that true? Or do you see many earlier
stage companies employing H-1B
 
stage companies employing H-1B
employees?
 
employees?
You know, I do have to say that it is a
 
You know, I do have to say that it is a
bitter pill to swallow, right? I cannot
 
bitter pill to swallow, right? I cannot
imagine like if you're starting a
 
imagine like if you're starting a
company and you start with whether it's
 
company and you start with whether it's
like seed funding, you only have so much
 
like seed funding, you only have so much
to start with and you need that ramp to
 
to start with and you need that ramp to
make sure that you're able to tell
 
make sure that you're able to tell
someone my company even if I burn x
 
someone my company even if I burn x
amount of money is going to survive for
 
amount of money is going to survive for
like a year, two years, you know,
 
like a year, two years, you know,
whatever it is. However, I try to think
 
whatever it is. However, I try to think
of it as an annualized cost, right? So,
 
of it as an annualized cost, right? So,
if let's say it's a h 100,000 for one
 
if let's say it's a h 100,000 for one
fee, right? a onetime fee. That's what
 
fee, right? a onetime fee. That's what
they're telling us, right? It's a
 
they're telling us, right? It's a
onetime fee. Then that's 33 and,000 and
 
onetime fee. Then that's 33 and,000 and
some change over a three-year period for
 
some change over a three-year period for
that H-1B. And all of a sudden, that
 
that H-1B. And all of a sudden, that
seems to be a little bit less of a
 
seems to be a little bit less of a
bitter pill because you can try to
 
bitter pill because you can try to
adjust your compensation structures to
 
adjust your compensation structures to
accommodate for it. And another thing is
 
accommodate for it. And another thing is

like, I've never seen the scheduled
maintenance be that long. And this is
 
maintenance be that long. And this is
why I can't help but say that maybe the
 
why I can't help but say that maybe the
government like really strategizes this
 
government like really strategizes this
really well to kind of make this panic
 
really well to kind of make this panic
kind of ensue because guess what? If I

wanted to. Right? So, it's just kind of
crazy how all of this is playing out to
 
crazy how all of this is playing out to
be honest with you. It's kind of a
 
be honest with you. It's kind of a
mixture of like disbelief, but also they
 
mixture of like disbelief, but also they
really thought about this. They really
 
really thought about this. They really
did to some degree at least in terms of
 
did to some degree at least in terms of
planning when to roll it out.
 
planning when to roll it out.
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting take because the
 
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting take because the
take from my friends who were scrambling
 
take from my friends who were scrambling
this weekend, you know, trying to bring
 
this weekend, you know, trying to bring
employees back into the United States
 
employees back into the United States
was like, I can't believe how haphazard
 
was like, I can't believe how haphazard

this was rolled out. And what you're
saying is is actually probably a lot
 
saying is is actually probably a lot
more methodical than people understand.
 
more methodical than people understand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's a mixture. There's
 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's a mixture. There's
definitely like this contemplation of
 
definitely like this contemplation of
like what stakeholders internally at the
 
like what stakeholders internally at the
government knew that this was going to
 
government knew that this was going to
happen considering like the tenor of the
 
happen considering like the tenor of the
guidances that were issued. They're like
 
guidances that were issued. They're like
one page. It was Adobe docuigned, right?
 
one page. It was Adobe docuigned, right?
You see the Adobe logo on some of these
 
You see the Adobe logo on some of these
guidances that are out. So, there's one
 
guidances that are out. So, there's one
side to that, but the other side is
 
side to that, but the other side is
like, well, like there was a lot of I
 
like, well, like there was a lot of I
wouldn't say it's like indicators, but
 
wouldn't say it's like indicators, but

And so again, we can disagree or agree
on if this policy is good like from a
 
on if this policy is good like from a
national standpoint, but I do think like
 
national standpoint, but I do think like
it does feel like that this is going to
 
it does feel like that this is going to
be achieved by limiting this visa. It
 
be achieved by limiting this visa. It
does feel like that that step could be
 
does feel like that that step could be
taken here. What do you think about that
 
taken here. What do you think about that
topic?

or we're an innovation economy that is
 
or we're an innovation economy that is
really going to rely on STEM and there's
 
really going to rely on STEM and there's
