Hey Nicole, how was your weekend?
&gt;&gt; Oh, the most relaxing weekend of my
whole entire career.
I mean, I think we all know why we're
why I'm here or why we're here today,
right? talking about H-1Bs and this
crazy $100,000 move that just came out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let me give the audience So,
what's up everybody? Welcome back to
another episode of HR Heretics. Today is
a special episode. If you were living
under a rock this past weekend, uh the
Trump administration late on Friday
night decided to make some changes to
the H1B program that many of us use in
tech to hire engineers and the like. And
so this weekend was a mad scramble for
many of you and trying to figure out
like what does this mean? How are we
going to like think about an immigration
program moving forward? Do we need to
bring back foreign nationals who are
current employees that are out of the
country right now right away which I
know many of you did. And so Nicole, can
you give the audience a quick background
on you, what you're doing, and why you
know a little bit about immigration?
&gt;&gt; For sure. So I am the principal
immigration attorney at manifest law. We
are a tech for tech enabled immigration
law firm and essentially my background
is that I have built a career in
developing, designing and establishing
corporate immigration programs and I
also have built a career in developing
creative solutions even in the most dire
of circumstances. So, if anything, I'm
probably like the right person for you
to really talk about what to do in a
crazy scenario like this where there's
just a sudden crisis or a sudden change
that really can change how you do or
deal with immigration.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, just give the audience a quick
rundown in case they were uh you know
doing a sbatical from their phone. What
happened on Friday?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So on Friday, the Trump
administration announced that they were
going to sign a proclamation, in many
ways a directive to have the USCIS and
the relevant stakeholder immigration
agency assess this $100,000
fee on H1B petitions. And I think what
made it seismic is that there were a lot
of comments on a live stream that made
people fear that it applied in a lot of
different circumstances that made it
seem that if you had an H-1B employee,
you were immediately going to be
assessed this $100,000 invoice, so to
speak. But that's basically what
happened is that they signed this into
effect that night. And then since then,
as you know, there's been a lot of
developments, a lot of announcements.
So, we're recording this. It's Monday,
September 22nd at 300 p.m. Pacific time.
What do we know today? Like, what are
the facts today?
&gt;&gt; So, I'll tell you what we do have. We
have a written proclamation that was
signed by President Trump on Friday that
explained that we need to start
assessing this $100,000 fee on H1B
petitions and that potentially the
Secretary of Homeland Security can label
what exemptions occur for this
particular fee. Thereafter, we had
guidances that were issued in two main
formats or two buckets of formats. We
had the press secretary of the United
States and the rapid response team
representing the president of the United
States publishing on X, formerly known
as Twitter, tweets that basically
expressed, hey, these things may not
necessarily apply to every single H1B.
It's not going to be quote unquote an
annual fee, but a one-time fee on a new
petition. And then we also got published
guidance from USCIS and CBP, Customs and
Border Patrol, on how they would be
adjudicating some of these applications
moving forward. But I think the one
thing that I have to express to every
single person who's listening to this
particular podcast and this episode is
that where we're at today is that there
are some things that are very clear and
then there are some things that are not
that clear.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So can you get into the very clear
and not very clear so people can better
understand?
&gt;&gt; For sure. So what is very clear is that
individuals who are exempted from this
fee include people who filed a pending
application prior to September 21st of
 
have a currently valid approved petition
that was approved prior to that date in
addition to individuals who are
currently holding valid H1B visas. And
they used or statements for a lot of
these things. So it's if you have one of
those three things, you are currently
exempted from having to pay that fee.
and the government has made it clear
that you don't necessarily need to be
running over the hills to come back to
the United States if you have one of
those three things. That could still
differ from what my personal advice
would be for every single employee or
every single person who is operating or
overseeing these programs, but that has
been made extremely clear. The other
thing that we know for a fact that is
out there that the government has made
clear is that for sure next year's
lottery for March of 2026 is when a lot
of these fees are going to definitely be
in effect. They're saying that if you
are a new applicant and you have won
that H1B lottery, chances are you're
going to be paying this $100,000
fee.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um and then what's left unclear,
&gt;&gt; right? So two things that are definitely
on the top of people's mind. Let's start
with the easy one, the exemptions.
Right? So in the written proclamation,
the government says like, "Hey,
Secretary of Homeland Security, you can
make the judgment call of what
industries and what companies are
exempted from this fee." And I feel like
that's a very significant carve out, but
we don't actually know what those carve
arts are going to be. Is it that they're
going to say, "Hey, if you're in health
care or if you're a physician or if
you're what is known as a capex exempt
H-1B, like you have this company that is
exempted from doing the lottery process
like a university or a college if
they're going to be exempted because
that's kind of the inclination or the
insinuation of that particular carve
out. But we don't know. We still don't
know who is exempted completely in that
type of mechanism. The second thing that
we also are unclear about is the way
that USCIS described who doesn't count,
which is this whole H-1B renewal
concept. USCIS in their guidance
basically said, hey, if you are doing an
H-1B renewal, you don't need to pay this
fee. But what is the definition of a
renewal? So, for us here as
practitioners that deal a lot with
H-1Bs, a renewal can mean many different
things. Is it that I'm filing to change
employers? I'm currently working for one
company. I'm transferring to a different
company. I'm now asking for an extension
because I am doing this transfer. Is
that a renewal? Or is it that I'm
staying with the same company, right?
And I'm asking for an extension of my
time to continue working for the same
company. And it's because of all of
these things and this vagueness of the
terminology of renewals that we actually
don't know if a transfer or a domestic
filing of that nature will be exempted
from these fees moving forward.
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
On this show, we tell the truth about
HR. And one of my favorite conversations
we've had was with Melanie Nanho. She
put it so simply, HR isn't about
optimizing for compliance. It's
optimizing for people, for culture,
trust, and workplaces where folks
actually want to stay. That's why I'm
such a fan of what Melanie and her team
at Athena are building. She was brutally
honest about it.
&gt;&gt; So, Athena, we're a compliance company,
which uh let's just put it out there.
That sounds pretty boring if you think
about it, right? Okay. Harassment
prevention training, not very exciting,
right? We are very lucky in that we are
in the HR tech space. That's required,
right? Harassment prevention training is
not really optional. You need it. The
question is, who are you going to use
for it?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. You're doing this training
whether you want to or not. But here's
what she told us about the impact.
&gt;&gt; The amount of impact that I've been able
to have from the HR perspective has been
just huge. It's phenomenal. We're doing
all these amazing things that quite
frankly too many companies don't do
because they don't understand the power
of their HR team. Instead of boring
check the box training that everyone
hates, Athena delivers content that's
modern and impactful. We're talking 200
plus courses in 100 plus languages with
a 93% learner positivity rating to back
it up. They take on all the tough
topics, harassment prevention, workplace
violence prevention, code of conduct,
and make them actually engaging. And for
HR, it's effortless. Training runs on
autopilot with automated enrollments and
reminders. There's even a built-in
hotline and case management system to
help a true speakup culture. Look,
you're going to do compliance training
anyway. Why not use something that
actually works and doesn't make your
people want to hide under their desks?
Done right, like with Athena, compliance
becomes a strategic tool. It's actually
a way to reinforce your values and build
a stronger workplace. Check them out at

Is it fair to say based off of how the
weekend ended up playing out that even
though we don't know for sure, what will
likely be the case is that transfers
will not have this fee applied to it and
that it will be more of the net new
H-1Bs.
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I would say that
confidently to be honest with you
because like it's very interesting that
they decided to use the term renewal.
They could have made it a lot more
clear, let's say, in terms of saying
like, hey, it's only for what we call
new employment applications. There's a
specific checkbox that we can mark off
on the forms. But, you know, technically
a transfer, especially if you're
changing companies, could be considered
new employment, right? It could be
considered a new petition. So, I don't
think I would say just straight up that
like, hey, I think the end result is
that transfers won't count. I actually
think it's better and more conservative
to assume that transfers will count and
will not be exempted and will need to
pay that particular fee.
&gt;&gt; That's interesting. Okay. I'm assuming
Sunday then was like the first time when
enforcement started happening on some of
this stuff. Like did you see anything in
enforcement on Sunday that you think the
audience should know about? Well, that's
the curious thing is that I didn't
really see much on enforcement, but
there were people who traveled after
 
who traveled into the country
successfully have been the individuals
that qualify for those three examples
that I gave earlier, which is that you
already had an approved petition before
that date. You already had a valid um
H-1B visa before that date or you had at
minimum a pending application and you
were coming back whether it's on a
different visa or based on the fact that
you had a timely filed extension. So all
of this is to say that I haven't seen
push back. I haven't seen somebody not
be able to enter since then, but I think
we have very little information because
only a day has really passed by and
people were so cautious that they would
rather not risk even traveling into the
country if they didn't qualify under one
of those three things so far.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. I saw an X on Friday
night or Saturday, an Emirates flight to
where literally like people were like
trying to get off of the plane in SFO.
uh which was just like a wild scene. So,
here's how I'm thinking about this. All
right. Again, it's Monday. I have a lot
of friends who I've been talking to this
weekend. Um and I think there's a
there's a number of topics for us to
discuss, but the first one I want to
discuss is like if I was one of these
people running an immigration program
moving forward, here's what I would do,
and I want your feedback on this. I
would do an immediate audit of every
candidate in the pipeline to understand
if any of those candidates are on H-1B.
And then what I would do is I would say,
okay, we're going to put these people on
pause except for very special
circumstances in which like we can
fasttrack somebody through if we needed
to. The reason being
I think the administration has made very
clear that H-1B is going to be a target
and we already you know most of the
people who are listening to this show if
you're thinking about this problem you
probably already have folks on H-1B uh
as employees and so for me the first
thing I would want to do is not make
that problem any bigger. That would be
thing one. Thing two would be starting
to explore other options that you know
traditionally maybe we haven't explored.
So for example like 01 EB1 those sorts
of things. Nicole what's your feedback
for me on that potential path forward.
So, I will say that I agree with you
that an immediate audit needs to happen.
And I wouldn't be surprised if at
minimum some really great immigration
practices have already reached out
proactively to their clients saying,
"Let's put together this Excel sheet or
I already have a report of a list of all
of your candidates or all of your
employees who are on this status and how
they could be affected." Right? I do
think that a lot of it is going to be a
case-byase analysis. Where are they in
the pipeline? Are they abroad? Are they
even in the United States? What
nationality are they in? So, I 100%
agree with you that an immediate audit
needs to happen. And I also agree with
you that the conversation about
alternate plans and being able to
present within the company to relevant
stakeholders that hey, if the H-1B
really does collapse and we already know
that it's going to be the focus and
attention of the current administration,
what do these alternatives look like?
because I don't necessarily see a
universe where there's completely zero
immigration. There will always be a need
to rely to some degree with foreign
talent or the ability to just bring
someone from outside who has a very
specific skill set, especially in an
innovation forward economy like ours
here in the United States.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's talk about some of these
alternatives.
Like I think you know when we were
talking before we started recording you
called it the alphabet soup uh of
immigration. So what do these things
mean? What are the likelihood that we
can take somebody that's on an H1B and
put them through one of these different
paths? And what are you recommending to
your clients today?
&gt;&gt; Right. So I'll break it down into like
let's call it three buckets of
alternative plans. And when I say it's
the alphabet suit is because they
literally use all of these letters and
numbers. It just does feel like an
alphabet soup of different visas. But
the first bucket that I try to think of
because it's usually like the fastest
has to do with what we call
countryspecific
visas, right? And the reason why I say
that they're called country specific
visas is because if you have a candidate
who was swapped into an H-1B or was on
an H-1B and they were here from
Australia, they were a national of
Australia or they're a national of
Canada or Mexico. Swapping those
individuals to an E3 for Australian
nationals is a little bit safer because
they're protected by a treaty between
the United States and Australia. And
separately for Canadians and Mexicans,
it's the same thing. they're protected
by the NAFTA agreement or the USMCA that
have established these pathways for
immigration to the United States or at
least work visas. So that's like a very
quick way because both of them usually
are faster at processing because they
could be done domestically here in the
US or very quickly at a border or at a
consulate at least for the TN in
particular. But that's like a very quick
one. The second one is actually a little
bit more interesting and much more
flexible for individuals who run STEM
related organizations or what I call
very innovative organizations and it's
known as the J1 program. Many of you who
are listening to this podcast may have
heard of the J1 whether it's through
summer work travel like you know ski
instructors or like people like running
like the ski mountains in like Vermont
or you might have heard of the J1 intern
or trainee program where you have an
intern coming to the United States or a
trainee who wants to just experience
American culture or an American
workplace culture for the first time.
However, there are actually a lot of
underutilized J1 programs that are very
STEM initiative forward. And the main
one that I want to talk about is the J1
research scholar program, which grants
an individual a up to 5year work visa
regardless of nationality and allows
spouses to work in the United States.
And when you hear the term research
scholar, maybe some of you will
immediately think, isn't that only for
universities? Isn't that only for
colleges? like you're a scholar, right?
But the reality is that the definition
is very expansive. It just says, are you
someone who is an expert in your field?
Let's say an engineer, right? Or a data
scientist. And are you contributing to
some level or consulting in some level
of research or innovation within your
industry for this private organization.
So if you are developing the latest and
greatest of the next version of
windmills that are out there to generate
wind power or if you are designing what
could be the future of digital banking
infrastructure. To be frank with you,
all of those things are very innovative
and require some level of research to
push those initiatives forward. So the
J1 research scholar program is actually
a really great alternative to some of
the programs that are out there. And
there's no lottery. you can immediately
file for it and it's a relatively quick
visa and it's something that a lot of
individuals have kind of missed out on
and really should be leveraging. And
then there's like the third bucket of
options here which is related to
extraordinary ability or the 01 visa or
its bigger brother let's call it which
is the EB1A which is the green card
variation of it. Very quickly, the
reason why I really want to touch upon
extraordinary ability visas is because I
captured one thing from the Trump
presentation when they were signing the
proclamation live on the live stream,
which is wording, right? Word choice
matters in my point of view. When you
say things repeatedly, there's got to be
a reason for it. And in that
presentation, they kept on repeating, we
want the top talent to be rewarded. We
want to bring the best and the brightest
to the United States. So they're not
necessarily saying we don't want any
foreign workers. They just want to
hyperfocus the immigration programs on
bringing quote unquote the best. And
they use the term extraordinary ability
a lot during that conversation. So
extraordinary ability is tied to the 01.
It's tied to the EB1A. So I can perceive
it in that all of the alphabet soup or
visas that are out there that the
government may not necessarily be
targeting and are trying to really
uplift it really would be these
extraordinary ability visas that try to
capture the best and the brightest of
talent to the United States. And there
are ways for employers to support those
programs to support the ability to meet
it. Some people think it's a very
subjective visa, but take a look at the
numbers. It has some of the highest
approval rates within the government.
you're looking at an above 90% approval
rate even under the current
administration so long as you have the
right pieces of documents and evidence
to show for it.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors. I
must admit, I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR. That is until my friend Heather
Doce, who leads talent at Signal Fire,
told me to check out Metaphil. I got
into the product and was like, "Wow, AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick." Metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting. Their AI
records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes, interviews,
and debriefs, then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed. I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations. I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPs and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards. Metiv changes everything.
With perfect notes from every
conversation, your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview. But it's so much more
than just a timesaver. Because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline. Hiring
teams can make confident, informed
decisions, and talent leaders can
finally take control of the interview
process. MeteView covers all your
compliance needs, works with all your
existing tools, and takes less than 3
minutes to set up. Join talent leaders
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora, and check out
Metivview. Head over to metaview.ai/
AI/heretics to talk to one of Metab's
product experts. Tell them that me and
Kelly sent you. Or you could just go to
their website and get started for free.
You'll be up running and AI enabled in
minutes.
You guys put out an amazing memo this
weekend. And the thing that I learned
when that memo came out is that the 01
has a 94.5%
approval rate. Now, Nicole, I hear that
and I go, how is that possible? Right?
Like there's got to be fraud. Like that
feels completely off to me. But I
remember when we were at Door Dash, we
only had I think there was like one
person on 01 and we were very judicious
about who like we put down that path. So
are you saying that you think there's a
world to where like we can expand that
pool of people as long as there is the
supplemental evidence?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think there is a way. I
think the reason why maybe right now the
approval rates are so high is because
people are judicious. But maybe it's
because we've been limiting ourselves,
right? Maybe it's because there's an
over reliance on the traditional
playbook of how we deal with
immigration. But again, I think maybe
it's like a selling point, right? which
is that the government would like to
say, hey, we tamped down and we shut
down the H-1B program, but look at the
uptick of extraordinary individuals that
we brought to the United States through
this 01 mechanism, right? This feeling
of vetting through a very set rubric and
criteria that can clearly be explained
as why this person is extraordinary. I
think maybe what they're trying to move
towards. Can I prove it? No. But I
really want to go back to what I said.
Word choice matters. There's got to be a
reason why they kept on saying
extraordinary ability and top tier
talent. I think that's the direction
that they're moving in.
&gt;&gt; Yep. So, I want to talk about this
debate that happened this weekend,
right? There's the actual policy.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And I think there's a there's a very
large debate to be had here and you have
on one side I think like the Gary Tans
of the world. So Gary Tan is the CEO of
Y Combinator and he put on X and on
LinkedIn this weekend a 100,000 H1B fee
won't bother big tech but it kneecaps
startups and body shops the same and
that's a mistake. Early teams can't
swallow that tax. Body shops who abuse
H-1B should be stopped. There are ways
to do that without entrenching big tech
and throttling startups.
So look, I've built these programs. Like
I've seen the inside of like how this
stuff works and the reality we're
talking about H1B here, right? I know
most founders are on 01. To your point,
more people are starting to think about
 
Door Dash, we decided not to put anybody
through the lottery because it was such
a like the I think last year's numbers
was like 11% of people got drawn in the
lottery. And so if you're a startup, you
already need a hundred miracles to go
your way. And so then you're you're
going to tell me the next miracle that
you're going to try and take on is like,
oh, we're going to hire this person.
We're going to try and like put them
through the lottery. Like my
understanding, Nicole, is like this
disproportionately affects growth stage
companies, later stage companies. Is
that true? Or do you see many earlier
stage companies employing H-1B
employees?
You know, I do have to say that it is a
bitter pill to swallow, right? I cannot
imagine like if you're starting a
company and you start with whether it's
like seed funding, you only have so much
to start with and you need that ramp to
make sure that you're able to tell
someone my company even if I burn x
amount of money is going to survive for
like a year, two years, you know,
whatever it is. However, I try to think
of it as an annualized cost, right? So,
if let's say it's a h 100,000 for one
fee, right? a onetime fee. That's what
they're telling us, right? It's a
onetime fee. Then that's 33 and,000 and
some change over a three-year period for
that H-1B. And all of a sudden, that
seems to be a little bit less of a
bitter pill because you can try to
adjust your compensation structures to
accommodate for it. And another thing is
that law firms will also try their best
to accommodate the legal fees that come
out of it. But I do understand kind of
the reservations and the nervousness or
like kind of this sense of why would I
invest in the H1B now with all of this,
especially given what I said earlier.
Look at all these other alternatives
that are cheaper that don't have this
$100,000 fee. Absolutely. I do want to
touch upon like the government dropping
this suddenly on a Friday and all of
these policy changes and things that
happening on Saturday and Sunday. That's
the game that they're playing right now.
That's the playbook that they're doing.
And you know what's so interesting? On
Monday, the Monday before all of this, I
logged into what is known as a flag
account. So, a flag account is an
account that we use with the Department
of Labor to submit something known as an
LCA, the labor condition application
that we need to get certified to file an
H-1B. When I logged in, I noticed on the
very top this banner that said, "Hey,
just letting you know we're going to be
down for scheduled maintenance starting
on Friday night all the way through
Sunday night." And I'm sitting there
like, I've never seen the scheduled
maintenance be that long. And this is
why I can't help but say that maybe the
government like really strategizes this
really well to kind of make this panic
kind of ensue because guess what? If I
don't have access to the system, even
after the announcement, even if I had
certified filings, I can't submit them.
I could not beat the clock even if I
wanted to because I lost access to the
very system that I need to have access
to to quickly file something even if I
wanted to. Right? So, it's just kind of
crazy how all of this is playing out to
be honest with you. It's kind of a
mixture of like disbelief, but also they
really thought about this. They really
did to some degree at least in terms of
planning when to roll it out.
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting take because the
take from my friends who were scrambling
this weekend, you know, trying to bring
employees back into the United States
was like, I can't believe how haphazard
this was rolled out. And what you're
saying is is actually probably a lot
more methodical than people understand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's a mixture. There's
definitely like this contemplation of
like what stakeholders internally at the
government knew that this was going to
happen considering like the tenor of the
guidances that were issued. They're like
one page. It was Adobe docuigned, right?
You see the Adobe logo on some of these
guidances that are out. So, there's one
side to that, but the other side is
like, well, like there was a lot of I
wouldn't say it's like indicators, but
it's like, yeah, they really did shut
down the Department of Labor website for
this schedule maintenance. And I
remember again like I thought about it.
I was like, why is it so long? I don't
know. Maybe they're doing something
cool. Maybe there's new software. I'm
excited. And now I know why I shouldn't
have been excited.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The last thing for me, Nicole, on
this topic is the Trump administration
has made very clear that they want
American companies to be hiring
Americans and Americans to be having
higher wages.
And so again, we can disagree or agree
on if this policy is good like from a
national standpoint, but I do think like
it does feel like that this is going to
be achieved by limiting this visa. It
does feel like that that step could be
taken here. What do you think about that
topic?
&gt;&gt; I think it's an acknowledgment that the
United States has a leaky domestic
pipeline. I think they're acknowledging
the fact that it right now where America
is in terms of like US graduates or
individuals who are approaching college,
let's say, that we're not where we need
to be in order to meet where the economy
is going to be very quickly. I think I
mentioned the term innovationled economy
or we're an innovation economy that is
really going to rely on STEM and there's
been so many smoke signals. I think the
semiconductor industry expressed like
we're going to have this massive like
 
just don't have the domestic talent in
the United States to fulfill these
roles. I think a clear statistic that I
share historically is I think about 15
or 16% only 15 or 16% of US high school
seniors are math proficient right and of
that 15 or 16% who are math proficient
only 30% of them end up with a STEM
degree of some format and like with
these statistics in mind I think the
government has realized well I can't
necessarily fix this on my own maybe I
need to figure out a way to incentivize
companies to also contribute to fixing
this domestic pipeline. But I think you
made the point here which is that now
companies kind of have to do it in to
some degree, right?
&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's going to be an
immediate fix, but for sure like with
those numbers in mind, I think you can
see into the future that 5 years from
now we're really going to have a problem
if this maintains. Are we going to be
able to domestically compete with a lot
of other countries that are very STEM
oriented or culturally very focused on
STEM education compared to where we are
right now as the America that we are
here in in 2025?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's certainly an interesting
time. Nicole, where can people find you?
