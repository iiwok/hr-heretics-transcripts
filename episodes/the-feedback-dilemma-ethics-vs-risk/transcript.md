what's up everybody welcome back to
another HR heretic segment today we are
going to talk about candidate feedback
and the candidate experience all right
Kelly here's this scene so Samantha
price who's a talent partner at
audacious Ventures a couple weeks ago
went on LinkedIn and dropped this
screenshot of feedback that her friend
had gotten or or a lack of feedback that
her friend had gotten from the interview
process and this is what it said she
said this morning a friend shared a
rejection email he received from a
company he was really excited about
joining he got zero feedback as to why
even after investing hours meeting with
the team completing a take-home
assignment and delivering a presentation
that he didn't get the job and so Kelly
what is your take on candidate feedback
and should
companies be delivering feedback to
companies that can help candidates get
better yeah I
mean this is this is I mean this was a
topic honestly Nolan 24 years ago when I
wasn't into it like this has always been
a topic and I'm glad we're talking about
it because the first thing the first
there's two parts in my opinion we can
dig into one is the ability in the
bandwidth to give every candidate
feedback second is the ability in the
skill set and the trust and judgment we
have in recruiters to to give that
feedback yeah right those are kind of
the two main axes for me um on the first
one you know not an excuse but the let's
talk about the reality of the market in
the situation right now right so all
these teams are lean there's been layoff
after layoff for
years like and I'm like I said I'm in an
interm role at Quizlet right now like
these recruiters are over loaded like
the teams are small they're really tired
so again let me just you know the first
thing is is it realistic to put on their
plates not only to find all these roles
the very small team to follow up with
every candidate let's talk about that
okay so I have a framework for this and
I'll actually go back all the way to my
time at Google okay so I'm at Google and
you know like I'm in I I got promoted to
a recruiter and candidate ask for
feedback and I shared it with my boss
and my boss goes it is company policy
that we do not share feedback with
candidates and I said why is that and he
goes well it's just an issue of
liability and so if we say something
that is
misconstrued and the candidate takes it
the wrong way even if we are really well
intended we can get sued and it's just
not worth it for us to take on that risk
and so you know I was young recruiter
early in my career and so I just like
accepted I'm like well this is just like
how the the world works so then I get to
door Dash and same thing
happens um except the candidate emails
me and this dude Andrew lad and Andrew
was one of our product
managers and so lad and I you know he
grabs me in the in the hallway after
lunch and he's like so what feedback are
we going to share with this
candidate and I was like well we're not
going to share any feedback lad because
obviously like it's an issue of
liability right it was the same answer I
got from my
B and he goes well that sounds like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what liability are we we're 50
people dude like we really worried
somebody is gonna sue us and and then he
goes and oh by the way how would you
like to be treated right because like
this person just spent you know call it
 
forward there's another person who's
better for very specific
reasons wouldn't you want to know and I
was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then I think really
what what happened is underneath the
surface I was a oneperson show with a
 
the thing that you just said which was
like godamn it there's like another
thing on my plate so here's I think
there's a a couple pieces for me one
is if somebody comes on site right and
they've gone through like the recruiter
screen the hiring screen potentially
like a take-home and then an on-site I
think they deserve feedback and it's it
should only be done over a phone call
right to reduce the liability and to
make sure that no wires get crossed on
text um also it's faster to live to
deliver feedback that way but I actually
have an addendum that I've been thinking
about with this which is the best way to
reduce your liability and to set
candidate expectations is to have a
contract with the candidate at the
beginning of the process and so as part
of like candidate applies or recruiter
reaches out like as soon as they get
into your flow they should very easily
understand what they are going to get
and when it's going to happen and all
this they just remove the ambiguity and
set the SLA with the candidate which
nobody does and so I think you basically
tell the candidate we only deliver
feedback after the on-site interview if
you make it that far um you will not sue
us right by signing your name on this
thing like you will not sue us
uh for giving you the feedback you do
not have to you do not have to get the
feedback it's only if you ask for it
will we deliver it and I think it's just
like such a more human experience so
like yes it does take more time but I
think if you do it for people who get to
the on-site interview it's the right
thing to do because of how much time
they've invested with you yeah I just
wrote something down as you were talking
that we've said probably a hundred times
since we started this
show and it's Clarity of identity
yeah and my why I say that is because
there Pro there probably is a right
answer in terms of humans deserve X Y
and Z but the reality is there isn't a
right answer you know what I mean it's
just kind of like talking about politics
at work decide what you want to do and
what you don't want to do decide what
you can do and you can't do if you're a
team of two recruiters and you're lean
as hell and you're dying every day maybe
it can't make sense for you to do that
be clear about that or if you are a
company that's up and coming and you are
really trying to get your brand out
there and just be like the best at all
of this at the experience and this and
that maybe you're like we're gonna
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do this I don't care we we're
gonna do it well and we're gonna hire an
extra person so that we can actually do
this extremely well because being
thoughtful about this and even if you
don't get the job if you feel like they
cared about you they really tried to
make you better they followed up with
feedback guess what I'm gonna go out and
be like I didn't get this CPO role but
they were great like great company great
process that has impacts on the business
long term so what I'm saying is just be
clear about what you're going to do what
you're not gonna do and why yeah so let
me just build off of that so yeah I
think the notion that it takes more time
is real but it's not
as extensive as you think right so in my
opinion you can send this was me and
Ashley Davis had this role and Ash and I
were like we're best friends and you
know she was like we worked together
since Google Google door Das Carta and
Ash and I have this rule which is if you
come on site you get a phone call
rejection
email but if you don't come on site we
reject you via email so like we get we
give you a phone call if you come on
site and then otherwise like you're just
getting emails from us and letting you
know going on and so if I'm on the phone
right I'm picking up the phone I'm like
hey Kelly um we decided to go move
forward with another
candidate that takes 30
seconds the feedback portion of that
takes two minutes right it's an
additional 2 minutes so if you have 10
on-sites a week we're talking about an
additional 20 minutes that's really like
what it takes if you follow the
framework of every single time a
candidate comes on site they deserve a
phone call from us because that's the
human and right thing to do
so that's how Ash and I always thought
about it was like that was like our
human rule on how we and you know
ultimately we did get to a point where
it was like we would leave voicemails we
would not put the feedback in the
voicemail we'd say hey we decided not to
move forward if you want feedback you
can call me back and then we'll give it
to you
life hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors
I must admit I used to believe that AI
didn't actually exist in recruiting or
HR that is until my my friend Heather do
who leads talented signal fire told me
to check out metav I got into the
product and was like Wow AI actually
does exist in recruiting and this
product is sick metaview is the world's
number one AI scribe built specifically
for recruiting their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes interviews and debriefs then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview and
I've seen VPS and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards metav view changes
everything with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and quora and
check out metaview head over to metav
view. a/ Heretics to talk to one of
Met's product experts tell them that me
and Kelly sent you or you could just go
to their website and get started for
free you'll be up running and AI enabled
in
minutes I just want to Accent the
importance on doing that live I I really
do like in any it's like any
conversation like it's not a text it's
not a slack it's not a voice text which
by the way I'm a big fan of audio text
right now for those I get I get a
million of those from you per week oh my
God they're incredible they are good um
it is a live conversation and let me
just let me just disagree with you that
here's the Devil's Advocate and this is
like the the lawyer talk that you hate
but here's the worst case of why that
doesn't happen so I I'm just saying this
because if if I'm listening I could see
myself being like yay we're gonna give
everyone feedback and let let's go
everybody like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] part about this
is It's almost like it could be H like
having a Performance Management
conversation so let's say you get a
candidate on the phone they're really
annoyed they're upset they didn't get
the job right so a few things can happen
one they can take you down a rabbit hole
and your two-minute conversation turns
into two-hour conversation of them
picking pulling disagreeing with
everything you're saying and that person
isn't skilled to uplevel or cut the
conversation off so they get pulled down
like a bag of rocks and it's just like
there's your two hours
second is the ability of these folks to
give feedback and recognize when things
might be uh hot water or danger or this
like it it is a skill it's all again
like I said it's like giving Performance
Management feedback to someone that's
really difficult and tough and so if
you're going to do this I just it's
almost like having a a SWAT team or
group of people that you feel very
confident can do this at a skilled way
because it can be a liability now
that's worst case Nolan but it is out
there look I here's the thing is like I
agree with you
but I for me this is part of a
recruiter's job and it's okay like I'm
not saying they need to be perfect but I
am saying they need to be they need to
be comfortable giving candidates
feedback they need to be comfortable
rejecting people over the phone and they
also need to be comfortable when a
candidate doesn't handle it well which
happens all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time for them to
just be like hey the goal of this
conversation was to give you
transparency into our process and our
decision- making we're not going to
relitigate this thank you again for
taking the time we wish you nothing but
the best yeah like they need to grow in
that way and I feel like just in general
in in general though Kelly like in our
society we are just moving away from
hard conversations because it's just
easier to not have them and I feel like
recruiters you know there's always this
sound bite right in in pee Ops and
recruiters like I want to seat to the
table well like this is how you get it
this is you learn to have hard
conversations with people and tell them
some tell them news they didn't want to
hear like you got to be good at that in
our profession you got to be good at it
yeah yeah and what I am hearing you say
that I I'll discern that too is that not
all recruiters have those skill sets and
it's almost like to be honest it's
almost like having an hrbp type skill
set in your recruiting team which is
yeah not super common so I think what
what what you're
saying is really valid and we've had
memes I've had jokes my whole career
recruiting is the happy fun you know
tont Town positive place and then and
then the HR team is the dark side hard
feedback these things need to be melded
um totally and they we we got to have
both skill sets on either side it helps
with Mobility right and bench and
succession planning of your teams it
helps with the lean teams we're going to
have with AI and everything else teams
are going to get more lean folks are
going to have to do more more and
different types of work and I think I
mean my career I haven't seen a lot of
recruiters have high skill sets in those
areas and that's what we're talking
about totally that I do want to take a
beat and talk about the other side so
for candidates right like what Kelly and
I just talked
about you are very unlikely to receive
from any company that you interact with
and you're not likely to get any
feedback and the reason why is because
what we've been talking about in
addition to the pendulum right now in
Tech is very very deeply rooted with the
employer like the employer has the power
it is employer-driven market and because
that's true candidates are getting
ghosted they're getting no feedback
they're getting weeks on end before they
hear from anybody they have to be the
ones following up there's all these
stories of nightmare process as a
candidate so you know I'm a Believer in
just like lowering expectations and then
you're just going to be like happier as
a person so just like have that going in
now I think the best way to ask for
feedback you know say you get a
rejection email or say you get a
rejection call from like me or Ashley
and you want feedback here's what I
would say I would say Nolan thank you so
much for telling me it was an awesome
you know it was a pleasure meeting the
team I'd love to stay in contact for
future opportunities I would sincerely
appreciate any feedback that you have
because I'm trying to get better it's
like my you know my personal goal is
like I want to continue to get better as
a person and my commitment to you is I
will not I will not argue with you I
will not say anything other than thank
you so
much and it's like when you open that
door and then if nobody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] responds
then it's clearly on them like they are
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but like make it easy for
the the recruiter too right like I think
candidates can make this really easy for
the recruiter by saying things like that
yeah and just to build on that let's
just
say let's just say I was interviewing
for a cheap people officer role and I
invested a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of time in this
process I was a finalist I didn't get it
you can either say ah you know go on
your way or you can do what you just did
and I'll take it a step further I would
literally reach out to everyone I
interviewed with every cxo the CEO thank
you what does that do it puts you on on
on brand for other opportunities yes but
more so it expands your network you keep
in tou these people they're all going to
go different companies they all know
other cxos that need great talent or
this or that it's this is how this
works like yes and you're so right and
just building off of that point I've
said this before and it's so rare that
it happens and like you should be this
person is the ultimate sign of maturity
is you do all of those things and then
you also open up your Network and say
hey my friend Kelly actually might be a
great fit for this here's her LinkedIn
profile do you want me to Ping her and
see if she's open to a conversation with
you totally dude like these people will
go to war for you forever right or let's
just say you interviewed with the CEO
and four other cxos you do that you have
coffee you keep in touch those folks I
mean I would do this you and I do this
all the time connect people and refer
you probably three each that's 15 more
referrals and then you help them and and
then it starts right I just people just
kind of shut off you know and that it's
like this is the end of the road and
it's like no it could actually be sounds
so Utopia but it's how it works it is
totally it is like one of my biggest Les
somebody said when I started working at
door Dash like you don't understand how
small Tech is and I actually think like
that was the wrong statement it's like
you don't understand how small the world
is like and if you want people to
associate good things with your name
just put value out there without any
expectation of reciprocity and good
things
happen cool all right everybody let us
know what you think in the comments
