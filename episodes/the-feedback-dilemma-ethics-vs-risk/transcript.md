mean this is this is I mean this was a
topic honestly Nolan 24 years ago when I
 
topic honestly Nolan 24 years ago when I
wasn't into it like this has always been
 
wasn't into it like this has always been
a topic and I'm glad we're talking about
 
a topic and I'm glad we're talking about
it because the first thing the first
 
it because the first thing the first
there's two parts in my opinion we can
 
there's two parts in my opinion we can
dig into one is the ability in the
 
dig into one is the ability in the
bandwidth to give every candidate
 
bandwidth to give every candidate
feedback second is the ability in the
 
feedback second is the ability in the
skill set and the trust and judgment we
 
skill set and the trust and judgment we
have in recruiters to to give that
 
have in recruiters to to give that
feedback yeah right those are kind of
 
feedback yeah right those are kind of
the two main axes for me um on the first
 
the two main axes for me um on the first
one you know not an excuse but the let's
 
one you know not an excuse but the let's
talk about the reality of the market in
 
talk about the reality of the market in
the situation right now right so all
 
the situation right now right so all
these teams are lean there's been layoff
 
these teams are lean there's been layoff
after layoff for
 
after layoff for
years like and I'm like I said I'm in an
 
years like and I'm like I said I'm in an
interm role at Quizlet right now like
 
interm role at Quizlet right now like
these recruiters are over loaded like
 
these recruiters are over loaded like
the teams are small they're really tired
 
the teams are small they're really tired
so again let me just you know the first
 
so again let me just you know the first
thing is is it realistic to put on their
 
thing is is it realistic to put on their
plates not only to find all these roles
 
plates not only to find all these roles
the very small team to follow up with
 
the very small team to follow up with
every candidate let's talk about that
 
every candidate let's talk about that
okay so I have a framework for this and
 
okay so I have a framework for this and
I'll actually go back all the way to my
 
I'll actually go back all the way to my
time at Google okay so I'm at Google and
 
time at Google okay so I'm at Google and
you know like I'm in I I got promoted to
 
you know like I'm in I I got promoted to
a recruiter and candidate ask for
 
a recruiter and candidate ask for
feedback and I shared it with my boss
 
feedback and I shared it with my boss
and my boss goes it is company policy
 
and my boss goes it is company policy
that we do not share feedback with
 
that we do not share feedback with
candidates and I said why is that and he
 
candidates and I said why is that and he
goes well it's just an issue of
 
goes well it's just an issue of
liability and so if we say something
 
liability and so if we say something
that is
 
that is
misconstrued and the candidate takes it
 
misconstrued and the candidate takes it
the wrong way even if we are really well
 
the wrong way even if we are really well
intended we can get sued and it's just
 
intended we can get sued and it's just
not worth it for us to take on that risk
 
not worth it for us to take on that risk
and so you know I was young recruiter
 
and so you know I was young recruiter
early in my career and so I just like
 
early in my career and so I just like
accepted I'm like well this is just like
 
accepted I'm like well this is just like
how the the world works so then I get to
 
how the the world works so then I get to

we going to share with this
 
we going to share with this
candidate and I was like well we're not
 
candidate and I was like well we're not
going to share any feedback lad because
 
going to share any feedback lad because
obviously like it's an issue of
 
obviously like it's an issue of
liability right it was the same answer I
 
liability right it was the same answer I
got from my
 
got from my
B and he goes well that sounds like
 
B and he goes well that sounds like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what liability are we we're 50
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what liability are we we're 50
people dude like we really worried
 
people dude like we really worried
somebody is gonna sue us and and then he
 
somebody is gonna sue us and and then he
goes and oh by the way how would you
 
goes and oh by the way how would you
like to be treated right because like
 
like to be treated right because like
this person just spent you know call it
 
this person just spent you know call it
 
forward there's another person who's
 
forward there's another person who's
better for very specific
 
better for very specific
reasons wouldn't you want to know and I
 
reasons wouldn't you want to know and I
was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then I think really
 
was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then I think really
what what happened is underneath the
 
what what happened is underneath the
surface I was a oneperson show with a
 
surface I was a oneperson show with a
 
the thing that you just said which was
 
the thing that you just said which was
like godamn it there's like another
 
like godamn it there's like another
thing on my plate so here's I think
 
thing on my plate so here's I think
there's a a couple pieces for me one
 
there's a a couple pieces for me one
is if somebody comes on site right and
 
is if somebody comes on site right and
they've gone through like the recruiter
 
they've gone through like the recruiter
screen the hiring screen potentially
 
screen the hiring screen potentially
like a take-home and then an on-site I
 
like a take-home and then an on-site I
think they deserve feedback and it's it
 
think they deserve feedback and it's it
should only be done over a phone call
 
should only be done over a phone call
right to reduce the liability and to
 
right to reduce the liability and to
make sure that no wires get crossed on
 
make sure that no wires get crossed on
text um also it's faster to live to
 
text um also it's faster to live to
deliver feedback that way but I actually
 
deliver feedback that way but I actually
have an addendum that I've been thinking
 
have an addendum that I've been thinking
about with this which is the best way to
 
about with this which is the best way to
reduce your liability and to set
 
reduce your liability and to set
candidate expectations is to have a
 
candidate expectations is to have a
contract with the candidate at the
 
contract with the candidate at the
beginning of the process and so as part
 
beginning of the process and so as part
of like candidate applies or recruiter
 
of like candidate applies or recruiter
reaches out like as soon as they get
 
reaches out like as soon as they get
into your flow they should very easily
 
into your flow they should very easily
understand what they are going to get
 
understand what they are going to get
and when it's going to happen and all
 
and when it's going to happen and all
this they just remove the ambiguity and
 
this they just remove the ambiguity and
set the SLA with the candidate which
 
set the SLA with the candidate which
nobody does and so I think you basically
 
nobody does and so I think you basically
tell the candidate we only deliver
 
tell the candidate we only deliver
feedback after the on-site interview if
 
feedback after the on-site interview if
you make it that far um you will not sue
 
you make it that far um you will not sue
us right by signing your name on this
 
us right by signing your name on this
thing like you will not sue us
 
thing like you will not sue us
uh for giving you the feedback you do
 
uh for giving you the feedback you do
not have to you do not have to get the
 
not have to you do not have to get the
feedback it's only if you ask for it
 
feedback it's only if you ask for it
will we deliver it and I think it's just
 
will we deliver it and I think it's just
like such a more human experience so
 
like such a more human experience so
like yes it does take more time but I
 
like yes it does take more time but I
think if you do it for people who get to
 
think if you do it for people who get to
the on-site interview it's the right
 
the on-site interview it's the right
thing to do because of how much time
 
thing to do because of how much time
they've invested with you yeah I just
 
they've invested with you yeah I just
wrote something down as you were talking
 
wrote something down as you were talking
that we've said probably a hundred times
 
that we've said probably a hundred times
since we started this
 
since we started this
show and it's Clarity of identity
 
show and it's Clarity of identity
yeah and my why I say that is because
 
yeah and my why I say that is because
there Pro there probably is a right
 
there Pro there probably is a right
answer in terms of humans deserve X Y
 
answer in terms of humans deserve X Y
and Z but the reality is there isn't a
 
and Z but the reality is there isn't a
right answer you know what I mean it's
 
right answer you know what I mean it's
just kind of like talking about politics
 
just kind of like talking about politics
at work decide what you want to do and
 
at work decide what you want to do and
what you don't want to do decide what
 
what you don't want to do decide what
you can do and you can't do if you're a
 
you can do and you can't do if you're a
team of two recruiters and you're lean
 
team of two recruiters and you're lean
as hell and you're dying every day maybe
 
as hell and you're dying every day maybe
it can't make sense for you to do that
 
it can't make sense for you to do that
be clear about that or if you are a
 
be clear about that or if you are a
company that's up and coming and you are
 
company that's up and coming and you are
really trying to get your brand out
 
really trying to get your brand out
there and just be like the best at all
 
there and just be like the best at all
of this at the experience and this and
 
of this at the experience and this and
that maybe you're like we're gonna
 
that maybe you're like we're gonna
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do this I don't care we we're
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do this I don't care we we're
gonna do it well and we're gonna hire an
 
gonna do it well and we're gonna hire an
extra person so that we can actually do
 
extra person so that we can actually do
this extremely well because being
 
this extremely well because being
thoughtful about this and even if you
 
thoughtful about this and even if you
don't get the job if you feel like they
 
don't get the job if you feel like they
cared about you they really tried to
 
cared about you they really tried to
make you better they followed up with
 
make you better they followed up with
feedback guess what I'm gonna go out and
 
feedback guess what I'm gonna go out and
be like I didn't get this CPO role but
 
be like I didn't get this CPO role but
they were great like great company great
 
they were great like great company great
process that has impacts on the business
 
process that has impacts on the business
long term so what I'm saying is just be
 
long term so what I'm saying is just be
clear about what you're going to do what
 
clear about what you're going to do what
you're not gonna do and why yeah so let
 
you're not gonna do and why yeah so let
me just build off of that so yeah I
 
me just build off of that so yeah I
think the notion that it takes more time
 
think the notion that it takes more time
is real but it's not
 
is real but it's not
as extensive as you think right so in my
 
as extensive as you think right so in my
opinion you can send this was me and
 
opinion you can send this was me and
Ashley Davis had this role and Ash and I
 
Ashley Davis had this role and Ash and I
were like we're best friends and you
 
were like we're best friends and you
know she was like we worked together
 
know she was like we worked together
since Google Google door Das Carta and
 
since Google Google door Das Carta and
Ash and I have this rule which is if you
 
Ash and I have this rule which is if you
come on site you get a phone call
 
come on site you get a phone call
rejection
 
rejection
email but if you don't come on site we
 
email but if you don't come on site we
reject you via email so like we get we
 
reject you via email so like we get we
give you a phone call if you come on
 
give you a phone call if you come on
site and then otherwise like you're just
 
site and then otherwise like you're just
getting emails from us and letting you
 
getting emails from us and letting you
know going on and so if I'm on the phone
 
know going on and so if I'm on the phone
right I'm picking up the phone I'm like
 
right I'm picking up the phone I'm like
hey Kelly um we decided to go move
 
hey Kelly um we decided to go move
forward with another
 
forward with another
candidate that takes 30
 
candidate that takes 30
seconds the feedback portion of that
 
seconds the feedback portion of that
takes two minutes right it's an
 
takes two minutes right it's an
additional 2 minutes so if you have 10
 
additional 2 minutes so if you have 10
on-sites a week we're talking about an
 
on-sites a week we're talking about an
additional 20 minutes that's really like
 
additional 20 minutes that's really like
what it takes if you follow the
 
what it takes if you follow the
framework of every single time a
 
framework of every single time a
candidate comes on site they deserve a
 
candidate comes on site they deserve a
phone call from us because that's the
 
phone call from us because that's the
human and right thing to do
 
human and right thing to do
so that's how Ash and I always thought
 
so that's how Ash and I always thought
about it was like that was like our
 
about it was like that was like our
human rule on how we and you know
 
human rule on how we and you know
ultimately we did get to a point where
 
ultimately we did get to a point where
it was like we would leave voicemails we
 
it was like we would leave voicemails we
would not put the feedback in the
 
would not put the feedback in the
voicemail we'd say hey we decided not to
 
voicemail we'd say hey we decided not to
move forward if you want feedback you
 
move forward if you want feedback you
