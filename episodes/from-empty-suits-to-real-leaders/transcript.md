there's a lot of
 
there's a lot of
people who this is where the joke comes
 
people who this is where the joke comes
from to your point it's
 
from to your point it's
like managers and execs who don't
 
like managers and execs who don't
actually do the work are dying yeah yeah
 
actually do the work are dying yeah yeah
and if you're a real IC and you're
 
and if you're a real IC and you're
actually doing the work and you're doing
 
actually doing the work and you're doing
more than your manager how can you not
 
more than your manager how can you not
resent them and how can everyone in the
 
resent them and how can everyone in the
company look at you who is that empty
 
company look at you who is that empty
suit and have any respect for you and so
 
suit and have any respect for you and so
this is why we're seeing this trend as
 
this is why we're seeing this trend as
we've talked about a number of times on
 
we've talked about a number of times on
our show meta is cutting out middle
 
our show meta is cutting out middle
managers the ratio of managers to
 
managers the ratio of managers to

larger there's a push back on these
 
larger there's a push back on these
people who don't do actual work who
 
people who don't do actual work who

show yeah I I mean I had on my list that
that that those layers are getting cut
 
that that those layers are getting cut
out and what you said I think is what I
 
out and what you said I think is what I
often said in my throughout my years is
 
often said in my throughout my years is
don't ask your team to do things that
 
don't ask your team to do things that
you wouldn't do yourself roll up your
 
you wouldn't do yourself roll up your
sleeves and model the stuff do the work
 
sleeves and model the stuff do the work
with them and get out there and I don't
 
with them and get out there and I don't
think that there's going to be a lot of
 
think that there's going to be a lot of
room anymore for empty suit Executives I

if you want to be successful in this new
world the way to do it is to get to the
 
world the way to do it is to get to the
lowest level of detail the way to do it
 
lowest level of detail the way to do it
is to work your ass off the way to do it
 
is to work your ass off the way to do it
is to just roll up those sleeves and get

to be empathetic on the other side of
 
to be empathetic on the other side of
it this wasn't always this way you know
 
it this wasn't always this way you know
what I mean like when in 30 years ago it
 
what I mean like when in 30 years ago it

experiment and the data is in and it
doesn't work I agree yeah and I think we
 
doesn't work I agree yeah and I think we
talked about this on the show too but
 
talked about this on the show too but
it's really easy to like go work at a
 
it's really easy to like go work at a
monopoly business or a business that has
 
monopoly business or a business that has
such a deep moat and you can't look at
 
such a deep moat and you can't look at
someone who's operating in that business
 
someone who's operating in that business
and apply those learnings to your
