all right what's up everybody welcome
back to another HR Heretics segments
today we're going to talk about the
empty suit executive and what this is a
piece by my friend Tyler Hogue Tyler was
a VP of product at wealthfront who's the
head of product at divvy and he's now a
venture partner at Pelon I think this is
actually a seminal piece Kelly and I
want to read a couple of lines uh for
people to understand what tyer believes
is an empty suit executive so he leads
off by saying there's a certain type of
startup executive that I've developed an
allergy to it's what he calls the empty
suit executive these are the types of
leaders who are above the work who want
to manage the work and who scoff at the
idea of doing the work themselves he
refers to these people as seeking status
specifically High status and there's a
couple of things that he mentions I'll
just read a few of these bullets which I
thought were really interesting he said
the empty suit executive doesn't really
talk to customers directly they believe
they are above selling and that it's the
revenue org's job to hit the number when
there's a massive bug the empty suit
executive drafts a mey mouth the mass
email to give some half-ass explanation
when there's churn the empty suit exec
thinks about it abstractly as a trend on
a slide the empty suit exec attends a
lot of conferences and sits on a lot of
panels the empty suit exec doesn't know
how to handle in-office conflict so they
often run to HR and Outsource hard
conversations they don't speak or write
like a human they adopt corporate robot
speak and then he goes the empty suit is
a fake and then he goes on to say we all
have a little empty suit in us a good
goal be less of an empty suit don't be
above any of the work be a real leader
what's your take Kelly yeah my first
take to be honest was no one wears suits
anymore so the suit thing was
interesting that's my first take my
first reaction everyone is this is
exactly the reason why people dislike
managers and dislike corporations I know
it says executive but this is where you
get all the jokes in the office space
Silicon Valley Series this is the joke
and this is why folks make fun of those
leaders because it's the TPS reports
it's not getting stuff done and I
thought it was nothing new here but this
in my opinion this is the main reason
why people don't like
management yeah right yeah a couple
things that I was thinking of when I
read this the first is that there was a
a story at door Dash we were probably
like 75 employees it was like I most of
us worked weekends I was like taking my
first weekend off we were on a Napa bus
with 50 of my friends and I get a slack
from Tony that our order Placer thing
went down so that was actually one of
the ways we were scaling like calling an
order it's like a robot would call the
restaurant and it went down and Tony
slack said drop everything you're doing
this is on Saturday afternoon 2 p.m. I'm
in Napa like three or four glasses of
wine deep drop everything that you're
doing and start calling orders in and I
remember at that point in time being
like this is such like what are
we doing here what is going on and as
I've reflected on that it's been crazy
it's like almost been 10
years that was the empty suit inside of
me and I love how Tyler does this if
everyone should follow Tyler by the way
his writing is incredible I love the way
that he structures his thinking but one
of his tactics is he's never punching
down he's never saying like this is
someone else he's like actually like
viewing things with inside him and I
actually you know there's a couple of
these things in here that I was like
 I definitely used to do this or
this is an area that I'm trying to work
on and to your point Kelly I think
there's a lot of
people who this is where the joke comes
from to your point it's
like managers and execs who don't
actually do the work are dying yeah yeah
and if you're a real IC and you're
actually doing the work and you're doing
more than your manager how can you not
resent them and how can everyone in the
company look at you who is that empty
suit and have any respect for you and so
this is why we're seeing this trend as
we've talked about a number of times on
our show meta is cutting out middle
managers the ratio of managers to
employees is getting much or sorry
employees to managers getting much
larger there's a push back on these
people who don't do actual work who
don't roll up their sleeves and there's
no longer this like oh I fly around at
 
Tower all day long and that's how I get
 done I think it's dead and I think
Tyler is calling it out as we've done a
number of times on a
show yeah I I mean I had on my list that
that that those layers are getting cut
out and what you said I think is what I
often said in my throughout my years is
don't ask your team to do things that
you wouldn't do yourself roll up your
sleeves and model the stuff do the work
with them and get out there and I don't
think that there's going to be a lot of
room anymore for empty suit Executives I
don't think at the best early stage
founder Le companies there was ever any
room
like right we just talked about this
Founders and empty suit Executives they
don't mix like it is like usually
big-time organ rejection because the
things that those folks bring in to
these founder-led companies org
structure roles
process building an empire all these
things that are just EXT best practices
you know all these things are allergic
to these Founders so I think that's
where you're seeing a lot of clash is
and that's where a lot of venture you
know L Founders are allergic to hiring
big Executives from large public tech
companies there's like a reason for that
and we've talked about the fact that if
you are an empty suit executive and a
large public tech company it used to be
easy to be that way rest and vest fly
around kiss babies and smile and wave we
talked about layers are being reduced
work is being looked at and then the
marketability of those folks we talked
about this with the layoffs if you're an
empty suit executive at Google for the
last 12
years how are you making sure that
you're out there getting hired get right
so in my story being in large public
tech companies for 10 years which I will
never talk badly of it was amazing the
communities the learning the scale those
things are all wonderful things I would
go back one day maybe and it's really
important not to let those environments
turn you in to an empty suit executive
because it's going to be real tough and
it's hard to do that when you're in
those companies right it's slower it's
safe I mean it's very easy to get lazy
and atrophy is what I'm telling you
yeah look I think we're in a moment
right now to where just in general
venture-backed tech companies early
stage Venture back tech companies are a
bellweather for where the world is
moving right go back to to 20072 2008
right Uber Airbnb it was the app economy
and the app economy was coming and you
see it first in Venture back tech now
we're seeing it in AI well the other
thing that we see with Venture back tech
is how to actually construct and run a
company and what we're seeing is
companies are a lot leaner there's fewer
managers there's fewer execs and there's
a hell of a lot more doers and I think
that is a bellweather for what is
happening across the entire economy
right now is in the era of AI we are
going to need fewer people and so the
people that we actually need or and want
are going to be the people that are
rolling up their sleeves and flying
around at 50,000 ft able to do the
strategy work so I think that's one
piece for me I think the other piece for
me
is I've said this before the worst
advice I ever got was fake it till you
make
it it's terrible advice because it's
inauthentic and it turns out like one
piece of what Tyler is saying is like
this person doesn't actually do real
work the other piece of what he's saying
is this person's a fraud and they wear
this suit every day and you don't
actually know who's like underneath the
suit you don't know who the human is
underneath the thing they just act like
a robot and I've told that story about
me in the past uh which resonated deeply
not you anymore it's not you anymore no
but but that's that's what I'm getting
at is there is a little bit of the empty
suit exact in each of us hey everyone
we'll be right back in a moment after a
word from our sponsors Real Talk most
Talent leaders haven't yet cracked how
to leverage AI for Meaningful impact on
their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting team's efficiency and quality
use metaview metaview is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
can minutes during calls and save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview but it's so much
more than just a time saer because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
join Forward Thinking Talent leaders at
high performing organizations like brex
hellofresh and quora and check out
medavie head over to metav vi. a/
Heretics to talk to metav View's product
experts or get started for free you'll
be uppr running and AI enabled in
minutes I think if you read this and you
don't identify with any of it I would
really caution you to look deeper
because each of us has these traits each
of us have seen other people are wanted
to look after other models and be like
oh they have it all figured out oh
they're so rich or they're so powerful I
would love that and sees them operating
at super high levels they don't see the
the nitty-gritty they don't see the
grimy stuff that person had to do and I
think we're entering era to where grimy
is about to be
sexy and that's what I love about this
because that's where I think the puck is
going yeah the other thing and you're
right we all have it in us like you know
again it's human nature to fall prey to
some of this stuff and get a little lazy
is you know and your environment's a big
deal around that but the other reason
why it's really important to look into
this is that it's just not inspiring to
be that person you know what I mean if
you're listening and if you had Talent
follow you to two three four
companies and you're known for building
these teams that are like you're not an
empty suit executive do you know what I
mean it's just we all know those execs
that we worked with or know about and we
all kind of ey roll to your point about
being inauthentic and just again
uninspiring so that's the other thing
that I think you're going to see is
brand and followers and modeling this
yeah to make people want to work with
you and keep going
yeah yeah the last thing I'll say is you
know I've been using this line too is
the comparison is the thief of joy and I
think it's really easy to compare and
look over the fence at your neighbor's
yard or at your friend's yard and like
oh like they have all these things
figured out and it really turns out that
unless you're actually living in that
world you have no idea the challenges
and hardships that people have gone
through I think one of the biggest
issues with our media today is they they
have this notion of over night success
which is completely untrue and if you
look at a lot of these Founders and I've
been lucky enough to work with two of
them who have been insanely successful
the best ones are always the ones that
are like grinding doing the hard
and so I would just say to everybody
like we're entering this new world and
if you want to be successful in this new
world the way to do it is to get to the
lowest level of detail the way to do it
is to work your ass off the way to do it
is to just roll up those sleeves and get
into the dirt and so I love this post by
Tyler Tyler this was like one of your
best ones I think this is a seminal post
and I hope everyone of our listeners has
an opportunity to read it yeah and just
to be empathetic on the other side of
it this wasn't always this way you know
what I mean like when in 30 years ago it
was a great thing to be a suit to fly
around and be important and make money
and go to conference like I just want to
put it out there that a lot of folks
were taught that and I hope as we go
through this next chapter which I'm
excited about that people are more open
about the things you just mentioned that
people talk about the grime and the
hardships and why this is a good thing
and their stories because a lot of times
it was like ignore I'm Big Rich and
powerful and I have Jets so that's how
empathetic is that Mad Men all these
things it was like a great thing it was
celebrated almost yeah it's that's such
a really good point that's exactly
right my take is we've run that
experiment and the data is in and it
doesn't work I agree yeah and I think we
talked about this on the show too but
it's really easy to like go work at a
monopoly business or a business that has
such a deep moat and you can't look at
someone who's operating in that business
and apply those learnings to your
business unless they're analogous
because if when you work in one of those
places you can get away with a lot of
stupid
 and I think that's the case now is
as things have become incredibly
competitive and are continuing to be
more competitive in the era of AI I just
don't think that stuff is going to fly
any longer I mean Google search business
is about to like it's taking a hit right
now perplexity if you guys aren't using
perplexity doai every day I have news
Google search doesn't work as good as
perplexity and so even the Monopoly
businesses that we've been used to for
the last 20 years everything is under
siege and I think if you're to survive
this is how you got to operate in the
new world yep so read the article let us
know what you guys think thanks all HR
