some ideas out there I think the
listeners would find this compelling
 
listeners would find this compelling
yeah I I think it values
 
yeah I I think it values
is mostly an overrated topic except for
 
is mostly an overrated topic except for
the handful of companies that actually
 
the handful of companies that actually
live them I think most values are
 
live them I think most values are
aspirational and not lived and so the
 
aspirational and not lived and so the
first thing is if you feel like there's
 
first thing is if you feel like there's
a hint of aspirational ism coming in
 
a hint of aspirational ism coming in
these values then it's a long journey to
 
these values then it's a long journey to
get zero Roi from it that said if there
 
get zero Roi from it that said if there
is true like we want to do this and we
 
is true like we want to do this and we
want to like make this change I think
 
want to like make this change I think
there's like a couple big pieces here
 
there's like a couple big pieces here
that you got to consider and I've done
 
that you got to consider and I've done
this a few times so piece one is the
 
this a few times so piece one is the
leadership team specifically the CEO and
 
leadership team specifically the CEO and
the founder if they are not fully
 
the founder if they are not fully
aligned with the thing nothing else
 
aligned with the thing nothing else
matters it's Dead on Arrival it will
 
matters it's Dead on Arrival it will
never work so thing one is getting
 
never work so thing one is getting
alignment with those people and then
 
alignment with those people and then
I've actually found thing two is call it
 
I've actually found thing two is call it
like your top
 
like your top
performers if they're not aligned it's
 
performers if they're not aligned it's
also Dead on Arrival and so if you think
 
also Dead on Arrival and so if you think
about it as the two different parties
 
about it as the two different parties
coming together you have to figure out a
 
coming together you have to figure out a
way to merge those two worlds which is
 
way to merge those two worlds which is
our executive team specifically our
 
our executive team specifically our
founder and CEO and then our top
 
founder and CEO and then our top
performers and if you can get those two
 
performers and if you can get those two
things overlapped then I think you have
 
things overlapped then I think you have
some magic to make but I think that's
 
some magic to make but I think that's
the hard part and that's where the
 
the hard part and that's where the
artist is getting those two people
 
artist is getting those two people
aligned and understanding what each of
 
aligned and understanding what each of
them care about yeah I like the point
 
them care about yeah I like the point
about making sure it's realistic to who
 
about making sure it's realistic to who
the company actually is people always
 
the company actually is people always
ask about scaling culture and creating
 
ask about scaling culture and creating
values and especially with very inherent
 
values and especially with very inherent
founder-led potent companies it's like a
 
founder-led potent companies it's like a
personality you know you can dress
 
personality you know you can dress
differently you can talk differently but
 
differently you can talk differently but
at the core you can kind of only change
 
at the core you can kind of only change
it so much and so it's really starting
 
it so much and so it's really starting
with being very honest about who the
 
with being very honest about who the
company is at its core kind of good b or
 
company is at its core kind of good b or
ugly like even if it's bad and you want
 
ugly like even if it's bad and you want
to change it at least be honest about
 
to change it at least be honest about
that that's your best shot at changing
 
that that's your best shot at changing
it and starting from there because I do
 
it and starting from there because I do
think that folks underestimate how deep
 
think that folks underestimate how deep
this stuff runs in those types of
 
this stuff runs in those types of
companies no one and it's very hard to
 
companies no one and it's very hard to
change so you might as well you know
 
change so you might as well you know
grab on to the things that are are good
 
grab on to the things that are are good
about it and that you want to keep and
 
about it and that you want to keep and
be honest about what might be more
 
be honest about what might be more
difficult to change or how do we
 
difficult to change or how do we
acknowledge it first so totally agree
 
acknowledge it first so totally agree
with that you know the hardest part
 
with that you know the hardest part
about values in my career
 
about values in my career
is it's qualitative stuff it's Behavior
 
is it's qualitative stuff it's Behavior
it's people it's subjective that's
 
it's people it's subjective that's
like very hard to quantify and yeah the
 
like very hard to quantify and yeah the
task here is how can you to the best of
 
task here is how can you to the best of
your ability make something tangible as
 
your ability make something tangible as
much as you can that's
 
much as you can that's
intangible and I would argue that the
 
intangible and I would argue that the
more you can make it so that people can
 
more you can make it so that people can
actually touch and feel what you're
 
actually touch and feel what you're
talking about across a bigger and bigger
 
talking about across a bigger and bigger
and bigger group of people across more
 
and bigger group of people across more

opinion would be number one this is one
of the things I think you should
 
of the things I think you should
Outsource have somebody come in and do
 
Outsource have somebody come in and do
it for you there's a bunch of
 
it for you there's a bunch of
professionals that do this work and you
 
professionals that do this work and you
know in order to figure out the right
 
know in order to figure out the right
one ask for references and then go
 
one ask for references and then go
really deep on those references to see
 
really deep on those references to see
like how much of it they got right and
 
like how much of it they got right and
how much of it they got wrong
 
how much of it they got wrong
