all right hi everyone hope everyone's
doing great this is another session of
our dear Heretics wrin newspaper column
series Nolan again we've gotten great
ones of these y'all so please keep
sending them to us in any way that works
for you really appreciate the scenarios
situations
and conundrums out in the real world so
this one on comes from somewhere in the
audience around values you know the
whole thing about company values
rewriting company values changing them
solidifying them making them real how do
you do that that that works what are
some ideas out there I think the
listeners would find this compelling
yeah I I think it values
is mostly an overrated topic except for
the handful of companies that actually
live them I think most values are
aspirational and not lived and so the
first thing is if you feel like there's
a hint of aspirational ism coming in
these values then it's a long journey to
get zero Roi from it that said if there
is true like we want to do this and we
want to like make this change I think
there's like a couple big pieces here
that you got to consider and I've done
this a few times so piece one is the
leadership team specifically the CEO and
the founder if they are not fully
aligned with the thing nothing else
matters it's Dead on Arrival it will
never work so thing one is getting
alignment with those people and then
I've actually found thing two is call it
like your top
performers if they're not aligned it's
also Dead on Arrival and so if you think
about it as the two different parties
coming together you have to figure out a
way to merge those two worlds which is
our executive team specifically our
founder and CEO and then our top
performers and if you can get those two
things overlapped then I think you have
some magic to make but I think that's
the hard part and that's where the
artist is getting those two people
aligned and understanding what each of
them care about yeah I like the point
about making sure it's realistic to who
the company actually is people always
ask about scaling culture and creating
values and especially with very inherent
founder-led potent companies it's like a
personality you know you can dress
differently you can talk differently but
at the core you can kind of only change
it so much and so it's really starting
with being very honest about who the
company is at its core kind of good b or
ugly like even if it's bad and you want
to change it at least be honest about
that that's your best shot at changing
it and starting from there because I do
think that folks underestimate how deep
this stuff runs in those types of
companies no one and it's very hard to
change so you might as well you know
grab on to the things that are are good
about it and that you want to keep and
be honest about what might be more
difficult to change or how do we
acknowledge it first so totally agree
with that you know the hardest part
about values in my career
is it's qualitative stuff it's Behavior
it's people it's subjective that's
like very hard to quantify and yeah the
task here is how can you to the best of
your ability make something tangible as
much as you can that's
intangible and I would argue that the
more you can make it so that people can
actually touch and feel what you're
talking about across a bigger and bigger
and bigger group of people across more
and more and more continents cities
states countries that's how you're going
to scale
culture like that's the trick is how can
you wrap 3,000 people's heads from all
over the world around these phrases that
are like act like an owner like how do
you actually make that visceral for
people that's the game yeah I'll add to
that and I'll
say you know think about like human
character
if I asked you about your character you
would give me all of these stated things
but really the work here is the revealed
right I don't care what you tell me at
all I care how you actually live so I've
tried to do this
myself uh and I failed yeah and then I
brought in a third party for an ungodly
amount of money and I would say they got
us like 70% of the way there but more
importantly Main ained my relationships
so I didn't burn any relationships along
the way cuz I think you can do that as
part of revealing someone's character or
revealing someone's company values
sometimes these things are coming out
that aren't the best things and so my
opinion would be number one this is one
of the things I think you should
Outsource have somebody come in and do
it for you there's a bunch of
professionals that do this work and you
know in order to figure out the right
one ask for references and then go
really deep on those references to see
like how much of it they got right and
how much of it they got wrong
but don't look for Perfection here
either because there's no such thing I
think these things are constantly
evolving inside of companies and so to
your point earlier it's moving all the
time yeah right and so you should be
okay thinking about this as a work in
progress constantly versus the Bible and
I think everybody tries to write the
Bible and it never works that way like
every company will reinvent itself every
 
at least if not more frequently I think
that's two of the main reasons why this
is so damn hard I mean you can't really
nail it right
because it's so hard to explain and
again make something consistent and
tangible across thousands of people
sometimes and to your point it's always
shifting always changing new humans
coming in new humans coming out I mean
it's it's a really hard hard thing we
did this at pendo which I really thought
was great and I'll credit Rachel
Pickering and Scott Morgan on this team
they called the Goldilocks approach and
it was one of the best things I've seen
in my career to try and make a value
tangible what do we do Nan we say okay
here's what being biased to act looks
like in this company but what we don't
talk about a lot is what doesn't it look
like um so good so it was this
Goldilocks approach of the porridge like
too hot too cold just right it was that
and not in a descriptive way in actions
like what am I seeing and hearing almost
like you're watching a movie not like
you're you're describing you're
describing something you're watching
what am I seeing and hearing Nolan doing
that's just right what are some examples
what am I seeing or hearing knowing not
doing at all that's not enough of this
right what might that look like if he's
not living it and then the other side
which this is where you can get into
weaponizing value
right what are we seeing or hearing from
noan when it's way too much you know
what I mean running around pulling the
trigger on and different functions
not
collaborating those are ways you can
weaponize values a lot where it's like
well it's bu stacked
great that's so good it was helpful it
was actually one of one of the best as
far as again getting a thousand people
wrapped around these things as much as
you possibly can yeah hey every everyone
we'll be right back in a moment after a
word from our sponsors I must admit I
used to believe that AI didn't actually
exist in recruiting or HR that is until
my friend Heather do who leads talented
signal fire told me to check out metav I
got into the product and was like Wow AI
actually does exist in recruiting and
this product is sick metaview is the
world's number one AI scribe built
specifically for recruiting their AI
records and transcri describes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed I've seen firsthand how tough
it can be to extract consistently
highquality data from candidate
conversations I've been in debriefs
where interviewers told us about their
feelings instead of what actually
happened in the interview and I've seen
VPS and CEOs block hires because they
didn't learn anything from skeleton
scorecards metaview changes everything
with perfect notes from every
conversation your people can focus on
creating a human connection with
candidates and they can save time on the
busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate and every pipeline hiring
teams can make confident informed
decisions and talent leaders can finally
take control of the interview process
metaview covers all your compliance
needs works with all your existing tools
and takes less than 3 minutes to set up
join Talent leaders at organizations
like brex deal hellofresh and Kora and
check out medavie head over to metav
view. a/h Heretics to talk to one of
Med's product experts tell them that me
and Kelly sent you or you could just go
to their website and get started for
free you'll be up running and AI enabled
in
minutes the other thing I've seen is a
quick process to the rough draft cuz
what always happens in these discussions
is you're kind of just like floating and
everyone's got like good ideas and then
you get into that trick of just talking
about good ideas and then the moment you
get it on paper people are like oh
this is too much right and so I think
like speed to first draft on this is one
of the the ways you can actually get to
success because really once that first
draft is done that's where the work
comes in that's where people all
over it and that's what you want and I
think the hard part about the person
person who's owning the value revamp
exercise is that it's such an UNG
glorious job until you're done and then
when you're done and people are proud of
it you feel awesome I remember we did
this exercise at door Dash and man it
took I think it took nine
months and we were 800 people at the
time and God I remember everyone was
asking when are the new values coming
out and like why is it taking so
long and I felt so exposed because I was
like God they're right like we should
just be moving faster and I'm happy we
took the time that we did by the way
what we did in that process was we went
to Tony and the exec team and we got the
 
sessions with top performers throughout
the entire company and we said okay
great we want to get your reaction to
these and to your point what does this
look like when it's at its best and what
does it look like when it's at its worst
and then we took that back to the
leadership team we did that four or five
times like that Relentless cycle to
where at the end of it people were like
oh my God just get this thing out right
right then we rolled it out in an all
hands and it was like such a moment of
company Pride yeah you know when you get
it right you feel it y but it's real
when you get it right it's not this
aspirational thing we're never going to
achieve yep our process took eight
months
and we had like a working Committee of
top performers cross functionally
driving this thing with the C team which
was really cool you know hear ic3
engineers and ic2 designers just go
toe-to-toe with like our CMO it was
really neat and you know the way that we
started that process because one part of
this question was how do I go about
changing them creating them is one thing
and then like changing them is another
and so you know penda was I think six or
seven years into its tenure as a company
and when I came in we happened to have a
company kickoff right when I started and
I took an hour of that company kickoff
agenda and we did a full thousand person
company values working session and one
output had to be each person had to
write down you know via a Google form or
whatever one their interpretation of
each value and two how they think the
company is living up to it day-to-day
and what they're experiencing or seeing
I read every single one and it was
really incredible so that was the fodder
that was the foundation for this working
team to work with that those ingredients
to kind of Kickstart this process so it
was full Bottoms Up which was kind of
cool that's really cool when we rolled
ours out we picked a small subset of top
performers to read out like each of the
values and specifically what it meant to
them and cool yeah there was like
literally Tears like people were crying
in some of these things and it hit so
well and so hard that it made all the
work and all the heartache and all the
like oh my God this is never going to
get done sort of a thing worth it but
yeah be careful of the failure mode here
because the failure mode here is like
you notice a problem and you are the one
that's like we should go change the
values and nobody else is on board that
actually matters
because I think I that's where it's like
you're trying to impose your own
thoughts and and your own thing onto the
company versus the company being like we
need it and it's honestly like one of
those things you should wait until the
very last minute to change because it
becomes so obvious that it needs to
change then the work becomes worth it
yeah the hotter the kitchen is the the
easier and better the work is around
this totally awesome great question
