all right hey everybody Welcome Back To
HR Heretics today we have Nathan Tanner
joining us as a guest Nathan was at
LinkedIn before joining door Das as an
HR leader that's where him and I work
together he was then the head of people
at neighbor and is now one of the best
leadership coaches that I know so Nathan
thanks so much for joining us good to be
here thank you so much for having me big
fan of the show and uh Stoke to be
joining today great to have you my
friend Nathan also has a book coming out
called the unconquerable leader for
whatever reason he had me write like a
little blurb in the intro that may help
probably will hurt the book candidly um
so everyone please please check that out
um and Nathan actually where I want to
get into is with coaching like this is
going to be the focus of this episode
and why did you want to become a
coach yeah so I had actually when I
moved into HR I met a couple of coaches
it was actually first at LinkedIn I was
responsible for vetting coaches for this
High development high potential
leadership program that we had and I
just thought like that would be the
coolest job ever the coolest job um but
it wasn't until I had this experience at
door Dash that I really really started
moving in that direction um like door
Dash was an incredibly rewarding place
to work it was a very challenging uh
time period and challenging role for me
and I just had this moment a couple of
years in where I just felt completely
stretched and I couldn't stretch anymore
like work
responsibilities personal
responsibilities we had three kids at
the time we have four now
uh Church responsibilities just like
everything came crashing down and I
literally found myself one Sunday
morning like on the floor like crying
uncontrollably and it hit me so hard of
like I can't do this anymore like I got
to get my stuff together like if I'm
going to show up for other people I need
to better take care of myself and so I
actually went out and and hired a coach
I worked on a lot of different things
and the experience I had working with a
coach plus all the HR experience that I
had put me on that path to then
ultimately becoming a coach and helping
people who are in situations like that
where they're struggling with work and
all the responsibilities to uh uh to
make real progress so wow yeah it you
you cover this in the book and it it
leads off like the book and it's very
visceral when you read it
and you know when you mentioned door
Dash being really rewarding but also
really tough I can attest to that I mean
it was I think all of us at that point
in time as the company is in hyper
growth we're just like hanging on trying
to keep up with everything going on I
mean it was incredibly intense and I I
had similar moments um and so so you get
so you get a coach and it you know it
kind of starts to impact you and now you
are a coach
um I think there's still a lot of people
that don't believe in coaching and are
skeptical of like why should I be
thinking about a coach or like what like
what will a coach do for me and so help
the audience understand like what is a
good coach actually do for the buyer
yeah so so high level any coach you're
going to work with is going to help you
accomplish your goals I have yet to find
a client that I work with who shows up
to a first conversation and says I don't
believe in coaching you persuade me it
just it just hasn't happened but what I
have found is a lot of people who are
like completely in over their heads and
in the biggest job they've ever had
before whether they're a startup CEO
head of people whatever it may be and
they're like something needs to change
going back to that experience I had
where I'm like on the floor breaking
down like something needs to change and
so I spend a lot of time with people
upfront like let's discuss that let's
have a conversation I ask a lot of
questions to better understand what
drives people what motivates them we
identify goals that we're going to
accomplish together and then and then we
make we make real progress on those
goals there's a lot of questions that
I'm going to ask of people to get at the
root of what's challenging them how they
want to grow but then there's also this
advice component that I bring that I
think can be really really valuable as
well yes thank you for that Nathan I
have a question we've talked a lot on
past shows around the slippery slope
right between our roles in HR or even
your role and what you're doing and like
the therapist's role right and you said
a coach helps you achieve your goals how
how do you balance what I'm assuming can
be a slippery slope when now you're
their therapist and you're going down a
whole another like bag of tricks and I
can just imagine that and might it might
even be more intense with what you're
doing versus what we've done in
operating roles in a company where it's
kind of there's more you know the
atmosphere is less
one-on-one neutral third party I'm
assuming that might be a thing that
you've
experienced yeah well well first off so
I I was an HR leader for a while before
becoming a coach and I often told myself
like I am doing coaching in this role
and yes it's true but if you work for
the company and you're like the hrbp
leader to an executive or even the head
of people you're working with the CEO it
is a very different relationship than
someone who has been hired from outside
of the company to come in and and work
with them and so the level of
vulnerability I get with the clients
that I work with is 10x what any leader
at door Dash neighbor LinkedIn was was
going to give me and so I think because
of that like at times I do kind of play
the role of therapist a little bit of
like you need a place to go to that like
you can't go to with your investor with
a board member with your leadership team
like with a a spouse or significant
other and so I certainly play that role
but it's only to the end of being very
actionable like you can vent you can
complain all of that but ultimately it's
like okay well what are we going to do
about this how are we going to push you
forward so that you can lead more
effectively I agree it's really
interesting I we could pull a thread on
that topic because what you just said
resonates really deeply is like when
you're getting paid by the company as an
employee the level of vulnerability just
isn't the same as when someone is from
like the outside that's not a W2 um it's
just such an interesting Dynamic for me
of like why that exists but like let's
set that aside for a second and and and
if if if I may on the level of push back
that you can give when you're an
employee at the company is different
like I'm going to push on the leader to
an extent but ultimately like my my job
kind of on the line where right now I'm
a coach I'm working with 13 different
clients you think I'm an idiot I push
you too far you fire me okay cool but
like you are paying me specifically to
do this job and so like I can push you
and I can say things to you that someone
who is in an HR leadership role may not
be able to to get away with I have a
question on that um just because I've
experienced it internally right in my
days at Yahoo Etc I mean I feel like
every executive how a coach right and
we're like who are these people they're
coming in they're wearing suits and ties
and they have their briefcases totally
like and some people just just very much
dislike them off the bat because of that
and I remember actually having really
great experiences working as a trio
right with that coach with the leader
and then myself providing different
angles of context and conversation I
like my my spicy question is how how do
have you worked with HR leaders internal
with maybe executive your coaching and
when has it gone really well and when
did it like totally fall apart and it
was a show I'd love to hear from
your side because I've only you know
seen a couple yeah the the relationship
between coach and HR leader is critical
because I'm having sessions with these
people probably once every two weeks and
you know I'm interacting with them
outside of that but unless I'm doing an
observation like they're sending me a
recording of them in a team meeting or
something like I'm not seeing them in
all of the different ways they're
showing up and so I'm very reliant on HR
leaders of like okay tell me more about
how this person is showing up like I I I
want I want that feedback because there
may be a perspective I'm not getting
from that individual and so yeah but how
do you close the loop though on the
other side right so there's like the the
front end side of the data for you to
help the person but then there's like
this intimate conversation that you're
having with the person and how much of
those details can you share with the HR
leader yeah so I I commit to the clients
I work with everything we're going to
discuss is
confidential but there are various touch
points throughout that like I am going
to make sure the company gets that
information back but it's going to be
through them so for an example I do 360s
uh 360 assessments with almost all of my
clients and I have them put together an
executive summary or a development plan
that is going to be shared with the
manager with the HR leader like they
need to know what we're working on and
what progress we're making um I'll also
often have you know every three months
check in with me the client and whoever
the stakeholder is maybe it's the the
the CEO or an HR leader it kind of
depends on the on the role that they're
in and the three of us will sit together
and discuss their development so it's
not you know the HR leader pulling me
aside and like hey what are you what are
you seeing from this person are they
actually growing and to go back to
Kelly's question that's where things go
bad when that line of communication has
broken down and people are coming to me
of like hey are you seeing progress
what's going on and I'm like remember
when we like set aside the The Rules of
Engagement that's not how we're going to
operate let's all let's all come
together and so that that level of trust
at times I think can break down between
the client and the organization and me
I've gotten better upfront at setting
those expectations um but it's still
important for for everyone to be align
there and what like what erodes that
trust the most like what let's just peel
that back a little bit like what what CA
causes that are there moments or events
or things that happen that that kind of
trigger antitrust if you will or what's
the story you're seeing you uh nine
times out of 10 it's when the
individual being coached doesn't really
want to be there or wasn't fully
committed and like HR or the executive
who reached out to me was like hey we
have someone we want you to work with
and the organization has one set of
goals and this person has a completely
different set of goals and so you know I
I have fortunately I'm in a situation
where I can kind of push back on those
engagements when I see them but
sometimes it seems like the individuals
committed and they're not and so that's
when things really really break down is
like I'm there to coach the person and
the person does not want to engage at
all
so sense Nathan tell us about in your
mind what makes a great coach and how
should a potential client assess for
those traits yeah um I think the first
the first thing that makes for a great
coach is experience like you don't need
to be a coach for 10 15 years but like
you have to have been in the arena doing
interesting things um like I I I think
being an HR leader is a great place to
go any sort of operator where you're
like at board meetings in the
conversation when like really meaningful
uh topics are being discussed like that
level of experience where you felt that
weight and you feel like you might be
like breaking down or really challenged
that I think is really important and a
lot of coaches don't have that which we
can come back to in a second so like
that's it the second piece I would say
is training and I think when I say
training people may jump to
certifications I don't mean that but
like can you ask powerful questions can
you build trust with the person that
you're working with do you know when to
like you know have you been trained on
like how to call BS when you see it and
some of it may not require training some
of that may be just skills developed uh
you know throughout one's career I think
empathy and intuition are also very
important of like when do I go tactical
and focus on you know developing
leadership skills and when am I like you
know what you're telling yourself a
really crappy story or like you're
saying something to me that doesn't
resonate I don't think you actually
believe that uh there's a level of
accountability as well of like pushing
people when they don't do the things
they say they're going to do um and then
there's also like a level of like
showing up being proactive
uh having like good customer service I
would say of like you know just staying
connected with people and like a
successful coach requires three jobs
there's three jobs that you have to do
the first is to find clients like you
have to be able to find people and
persuade them to work with you the
second is you actually have to coach
them which is where most of the people
spend time on then the third is like you
are running a business assuming you're a
self-employed individual which I think
most coaches are like you have to send
invoices you have to figure out your
taxes like you have to run the business
around it and like if you are just good
at one or two of those things um like
it's not it's not going to work out y
hey everyone we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our

replicate modal and more try ATO instant
ly at
ado.com that's
aio.com and tell a Nolan and Kelly from
HR heretic sent
 
you and then how does a how does a
prospective client assess so like let's
let's talk about the experience thing
first so I think this is um this is a
debated topic you know one of the issues
that I have with the proliferation of
coaching is that you have a bunch of
people who have no experience in the
arena I call them like The Weekend
Warriors who now you know they went uh
on Friday Saturday Sunday and now
they're a certified life and executive
coach and they're out there telling
people who are actually building real
 how to operate like for me that
feels like a
complete it's a Miss um and it just
doesn't seem like relevant at all so
like from an experience standpoint
should a client be optimizing for
somebody who has like worked in similar
types of companies or what specifically
do you mean by experience as it relates
from the client's
perspective yes as I think about what
you need how you should go about
assessing a coach it's first and
foremost like what have they actually
done I don't think if you're a if you're
a head of marketing I don't think you
need to hire a coach who is uh has been
ah head of marketing like you should go
out and find mentors and people who can
give you like very specific advice on
that that may be a separate topic but
like does this person understand and the
unique
challenges that I am going through and
this is why I often work with startup
CEOs because like I have been there like
I know what it's like when yeah you're I
mean I haven't been in that role but
I've been very very close to people who
are in that roles and like the weight
startup CEOs carry are like 10x heavier
than the head of people or in other
roles and so like you know you need to
be in the arena have you operated to
that level do you know the environment
and so like if you've only been at
Fortune 100 companies uh or if these
coaches have only worked with that and
you're a startup CEO or you know
something like that like it's probably
not going to be a good experience
because they don't they just don't know
you and understand you um I can get into
a couple of other areas but anything
more on uh on that one no that one
reminds me there's a book out right now
called bad therapy and the and generally
like the the summary of that book is
like when you don't have
experience and yet you are uh providing
feedback as if you do have experience
it's a very dangerous game and that it
that's kind of what it sounds like what
you're saying there is like you have
lived life as a startup operator such
that now you are uniquely qualified to
provide advice to people that are going
through that Journey themselves yeah
yeah and in this world that matters a
lot I mean just it it it's everything
and no one's going to hire you for talk
about theoretical models they want you
to help them get through the
because you've done it before and you
can help them see around the
corners and I I am a I am a trained
certified coach uh I can walk through
credentials I don't think that is the
end all be all no one ever asks me like
where did you get certified what was
that process like how thorough was it
they do all of the time ask me tell me
about your experience at door dash tell
me about your experience at neighbor or
coaching other people who are in similar
situations to me and so it it it does it
does matter quite a bit and and
something too that's important and I
think why people often work with me and
I recommend they do this with others of
like I lead from the perspective of a
coach and what I mean by that is I lead
with questions I challenge assumptions
I'll call BS if I see it like I am a
trusted thought partner and I will help
people to try and see all sides of a
challenge before them ultimately making
the
decision but I will like take off the
coaching hat and provide advice when
people are ready for it and say this is
what I've seen the past companies this
is what I've seen with with other
clients of mine and that I think is a
tricky balance because if you just lead
from experience and advice I don't think
it's super valuable but if you only lead
with questions and you're only like well
what do you think you should do Nolan
what do you think you should do Kelly
and you're like I don't tell me Nathan
like genely need help on this like
that's not going to work either and so
it is a tricky balance of like when do I
bring in the advice piece versus like
keeping what I call the coaching hat on
yeah it requires like a nuance and and
intuition that only comes from I think
operating experience mhm yeah okay
absolutely okay so
um if I so I've worked with three
coaches now personally and I find that
in the 9 to 12 month range I have like
extracted 80% of their brain and I kind
of know what they're going to tell me in
the session is my take is is like that's
the time to like go and get a new coach
and see if there's like uh other tools
that I need to add to my tool belt and
so I've said um in the past that I think
you should fire your coach every 9 to 12
months what's your take on
that I all of my engagements start with
six-month
commitments I would probably do a year
if I if I felt that people were willing
to because when you jump into a coaching
relationship you're kind of jumping into
the unknown a little bit I mean I do I
do free sessions with clients before
they sign on so they get a sense of
whatching feels like um and I find that
to be valuable for them to assess
whether I'm a fit but also for me to
understand like do I want to spend a lot
of time with this person um and so I
start with six-month commitments
generally we renew for another six
months Nolan it's funny I went back and
looked at the data of the average tenure
if you will of my clients and it is just
over one year and I I I while I think
many of the clients I work with get
value from working with me much longer
some people I've been working with for
three or four years um because they're
facing new and different challenges what
you brought up makes a ton of sense of
like I hope that this is a relationship
that ultimately you graduate from or
move on from and in your mind you're
thinking oh I wish I had a session with
Nathan right now if I was going to ask
him this question what might he push me
on or what advice might he give and like
maybe I can shortcut this and figure it
out myself there's nothing wrong with
people who want to continually work with
a coach for much much longer but like I
find out at least for me people are
working with me for about a year and I
am totally okay with that is that a
weekly session Nathan I'm assuming or
how does that work monthly for me it's
generally uh every 2 weeks for an hour
we spend a little bit more time up front
um getting to know each other um usually
doing a 360 or some other assessment
early on but on an ongoing basis it's
generally every two weeks for an hour
with you know Communication in between
those Yeah you mentioned this is a
business and this is essentially like
your this is your Revenue stream how do
you balance the line of like well this
is ARR on the table for me versus this
client is ready to graduate it is a
really good question um for me I did not
get into coaching
to maximize revenue or create a business
that I hope to just grow at 10 20 30%
every single year um I I did it because
I wanted to make like meaningful change
in people's lives and I also wanted to
make money like that that is also a very
important piece to this and so I I I
think it's I think it's important to
like gradually have you know a steady a
steady uh generation of new clients and
that's important and I think if you're a
good coach that is going to happen um
where like your clients are referring
you to new people um also it's it's just
fun early on in the process like to work
with someone new and like oh this isn't
a completely different person like I
it's it it can grow a little stale at
times and I do everything I can to avoid
that but the coaching
relationship uh can at times like get a
little bit stale and so I I I love
starting with new people and building
that building that relationship and
figuring it out over time how do you how
do you find new people Nathan like how
how have they come to you um what's your
limit right balancing quality and
quantity right to Nolan's ask on the
revenue there you say no because of
certain reasons and lastly remote versus
in person do you ever make a point to go
find folks in person and be like listen
we're in different states we talk we got
to meet in person at least three times a
year or something like that yeah yeah so
most of well maybe I'll start maybe I'll
start with the the last part of your
question uh I live in southern Utah most
of my network is in the Bay Area and
some of it in the Salt Lake area so I in
those places uh you know quite a bit I
love meeting with clients in person like
one of the challenges of being
self-employed and working from home is
like a lot of times it's just me and
it's really really fun to meet with
people so every couple months I'll I'll
travel to meet with clients in person
awesome but the the consistent sessions
are done over Zoom or over the phone I
have one client who only meets over the
phone he refuses to to talk over Zoom
and like I actually kind of like that
which is a separate a separate
conversation um but in terms of finding
clients early on when I was going
through the certification process and
this is why it was valuable for me I had
to hit a hundred hours of coaching and
it had to be paid so early on like I'm
working with anybody who will work with
me some of them are at at door Dash
which is where I was when I got
certified others are just like kind of
friends and family and even those people
weren't paying me that much it built
relationships and so now those people
have referred me to others and that
continues to happen so number one source
of new clients is current or past
clients um I'll get a decent amount of
introductions from VCS uh which has been
really helpful like they see a portfolio
company a leader in their portfolio
company they want to hire a coach for um
you know I'm I'm Fair active on social
media mainly LinkedIn I'll post once or
twice a week that will occasionally lead
to someone new but I think more than
anything it probably reminds people of
what I do not that I post like hey
everyone I'm a coach hire me but just
like trying to put out good content
regularly is like oh yeah he's a coach
maybe I should work with them right
right what what hasn't worked I joined
this coaching Marketplace and I won't
share the name but like it was the most
arduous process to like get selected and
get picked um and I was like cool once I
make it I won't have to worry about
business development like clients are
just going to be like referred left and
right and I have gotten zero clients
from that and so I I think that's one
thing for coaches or potential coaches
to be aware of of like there are a lot
of promises and opportunities around
like you know easy easy Business
Development or easy opportunities or so
it seems but like almost everything has
just come from my network from people
from people that I know and those are
relationships that have been built over
over decades you have to build your own
book like there there is just no
substitute for building your own book so
so you guys you guys put out a an
excellent episode I'm gonna I'm gonna
plug you guys if that's okay an
excellent episode on networking and if
you have not listened to that go back
and do it I think it's something that we
have Miss
the last few years of kind of like Co
and postco of like easy jobs you apply
and you get it like we have
underinvested in networking in building
relationships and staying in touch with
people that we like and like that is
that is really really critical it's yeah
I it's so funny you said that Nathan
because I was just thinking about that
episode in my head um right before you
said it but I can't tell you again even
now I mean I had someone last week say
hey we worked together like eight years
ago I'm in this new role can can I can
you help me like once a month something
like that right and and all these folks
are now leaders from 15 years ago and
they remember you from these companies
and or you helped someone just
altruistically it's it's it's probably
one of my biggest passions in this
industry so definitely amen definitely
all right Nathan let's continue with the
the economics of coaching so talk to us
about like you know when you were a W2
employee you know you're making a good
tech salary and then you go become a
coach like what were your expectations
and what is actual reality for you okay
yeah um Le let me preface that with this
this is a very uncomfortable thing to
talk about and as I share this you may
get uncomfortable I am uncomfortable
talking about this I I'm happy to do it
because I think that this is a black box
for many people
like we we just we just don't know what
people make in various roles in various
Industries and so for me when I was at
door Dash uh the salary I had around the
time I left was
 
Equity I left door Dash and I joined a
startup I was optimizing for Equity so I
took a you know cash comp which was much
much less and when I launched my
coaching business my goal was like okay
I'm not trying to optimize for income
but there is a certain level I need to
make to like take care of my needs um
and so very first client that I worked
with uh this is before I made the jump
was a three-month engagement
for500 um $1,500 three months um I made
the the kind of which which which isn't
which isn't that much and if you're
building your business on engagements
like that it's it's not going to work
but that engagement led to lots of
others and so I think one of the things
you you didn't ask is like what should
you be doing now if you ultimately want
to launch a coaching business or
Consulting business and that is to start
doing it on the side and start getting
comfortable and familiar with charging
people money even if it's not ultimately
you know what you're what you're going
to so um January through July of 2020
while I was doing this kind of on the
side um during that seven-month period
my business did
 
full-time jump into coaching and during
the last five months of that year uh I
did
 
um 2023 was my first full calendar year
being a coach um and the business did
did
 
I was really really happy with my goals
were much lower because like the first
year I'm like I don't even know if I can
do this I'm gonna set aside enough
savings to figure it out and like I want
to do this I hope we can do this and
let's let's let's go for it um
 
better than any quarter I've had in the
past right now I'm we've talked about
the book a little bit but like I'm I'm
really focused on like making the book
as successful as possible so I've
actually reduced the number of clients I
had 16 was my Peak um right now I'm at
 
somewhat intentional um so anyway happy
happy to go into a little bit more but
that's kind of the you know for me how
i' how I thought about it that that's
that's awesome and you know for those of
us myself included you know thinking
about at some Point going independent
into Consulting right that 335k might
seem like a ton of money but
remember that's not your salary at door
Dash when your benefits are covered
everything else so you're you're having
to fund a lot of stuff out of that so
it's not uncommon for even a 500K annual
salary to kind of be just enough
considering all the other things you
have to do on your own yeah and it's
it's a great point
and I found that it's really lumpy so I
often will charge
clients uh the full amount full kind of
six-month fee
upfront sometimes it's split across
three different payments and so I have
months sometimes that are larger than
the next three months interesting and
and it's very different like you're in a
salaried role and you get your your
paycheck and you can manage to that
where me like if all the money comes in
and I go spend all that money like I'm I
I might bring in 2,000 the next month
and it's like okay well now I'm uh now
I'm in a world of hurt so I love this I
love how we're demistifying this because
it you're right it has been a black box
everyone's like oh these fancy exec
coaches they're making all this money
what are they doing so it's actually
very helpful and how do you get these
rates I mean is there a compensia or
Radford for Executive coaching how do
you know yeah it's it's a really good
question so I I heard uh in the research
that I did I saw this I remember when I
was making the jump that the average
coach makes
 
year and 30% of coaches don't make it
past year one um and so like it it can
be really hard I know coaches who are
all over the place you know 100K for a
six-month engagement or coaches who are
like a very very very very small
fraction of that um and so I I I share
this not to say this is good this is bad
it's really a wild wild west and so
there isn't a compensia I've talked to
coaches and some of them I've built a
relationship and they've they've told me
where where they're at some are much
much higher than than where I was at
last year others others are lower um and
I think it also really depends on like
what are you optimizing for like if
you're trying to maximize individual
compensation this may not be the route
for you you may be better off going out
and getting a getting a corporate job um
but yeah I mean it it it depends there's
so many different variables the other
thing I've noticed even with Consulting
as we've seen it through Continuum is
that every single one of these
consultant markets are n of one like and
so it is are you in demand is your
specific skill in demand and are other
people saying things about you that make
you even more in demand yeah and so like
the rates we've seen just I mean there
the Delta is massive between the top end
and the low end and it's the number one
question we get is like well what should
I charge and I always tell people is
like well if you're asking that question
it should be lower than you think
because if you don't know the answer to
that question you don't have enough reps
and you don't have a line out the door
waiting for you yeah and once you start
building your book and you have a line
out the door that's the time to start
increasing rates I'm actually curious
Nathan is that what you did with your
book and that's that that yeah that was
a very intentional decision for me when
I
launched I was one of one of the things
I was optimizing for was uh the number
of clients that I had it wasn't Revenue
I wanted to get to 10 clients as quickly
as possible and was very intentional
because I knew the you know I was at a
series B startup um that's what I knew
that's what I understood I intentionally
went after seed series a series B CEOs
who were underserved and had never hired
a coach before if I would have gone out
and like okay I'm just going to Target
the like you know Fortune 500 companies
or the top 10 tech companies like it
would have been a blood bath because
like coaches are swarming these
companies and they have all the
relationships but every time I talk to a
startup CEO their decision was do I hire
Nathan or do I do nothing and so then I
I came in at a rate that like some of my
coaching friends would laugh at uh and
I'm like I don't care that's not what
I'm optimizing for and so over time I
have been able to I still work with
startup CEOs a lot but I've been able to
work with larger companies where you can
charge a higher rate um and so there's a
there's there's a little bit of a
balance that's uh that's come with that
and then yeah and then you get the
situation of like okay I have 14 clients
right now you want to work together cool
like here's the new rate here's what
it's worth to me one last question on
that like do you need a bunch of fancy
collateral right websites and this and
that I mean how how do you think about
representing yourself what what do you
need to have out there I know we don't
have business cards anymore right yeah
who has those I I wish we had business
cards I know I always kind of liked
them yeah so I I I I I am on LinkedIn
obviously I created a landing page it's
Nathan tanner. net you know it's just my
name I think that is I think it's good
to have a landing page like my writing's
on there but like it's not fancy I mean
I might have
invested $1,000 1,500 into it like you
could spend 10 15K way more than that
and create a beautiful beautiful website
um and I just don't think it's necessary
because like I don't know you you two
are smart and in the market how often do
you look at someone's website and think
oh wow this is a really cool website I
want to do business with this person um
literally never never okay yeah but I
will say there's a there's an aspect of
the deck that could be potentially
helpful like do you share a especially
if the the
buyer um or maybe rather the decision
maker is different than the client how
do you navigate like when that situation
happens yeah so when when I'm work with
when I work with startup CEOs the
decision maker is the client yeah
exactly I love that because you get you
get into like budget and it's like the
budget is does the CEO want to work with
I decided it and you're done um you get
to larger companies and it often is very
different and you're working with an HR
leader and they're like we only hire
coaches at this rate like that is that
is what we do um then I think a website
might be a little more valuable I have a
three- pager that I've put together that
has my bio my perspective on coaching a
few endorsement endorsements from
clients and I'll send that out to people
I think it's helpful to have that I
think it's good to have some collateral
but
like there you you you you should set a
certain number of hours of like this is
how much I'm investing in collateral and
no more because it's so easy to live in
your own head and just like you know I'm
going to spend all my time on this and
the reality is like you should be
talking to people or coaching people or
interacting with people like that's
that's where it's going to to come from
the number of people who have just
randomly reached out from my website I
might have gotten one client of all of
the people that I've worked with yeah
networking a word of mouth just that's
it yeah Nathan this has been incredibly
helpful um I really appreciate your
transparency I know it can be taboo to
talk about these topics but you know as
um you you know my manager from door
Dash Andrew Monday he told me how much
money he made in the IPO and he I'll
never forget it he said I'm not telling
you to brag I'm telling you so you can
learn what to do when you make this much
money and I think the same is true in
this situation for all um coaches either
out there right now or people that are
thinking about coaching or even clients
uh this is super helpful information for
people um one last thing I just want to
compliment you on as a friend you and I
have been having these discussions for
probably like four or five years and I
remember going back to when you know you
were really thinking about it and it was
a tough time in the economy and I
remember giving you advice I was like
dude I don't know like you told me not
to do it yeah exactly I was like I don't
know right now um like it's really bad
out there and what I love about what you
did is that you burned the boats and you
went all the way
in and I think if more people do that in
life when you when you forge into the
unknown and you don't know what's going
to happen you become more resilient yeah
and in your case you have seen success
and obviously it is because you've
burned the boats but even if you don't
see success burning the boats I think
teaches you a lot about yourself and so
it's been really fun as your friend to
watch your journey I appreciate that I
appreciate that yeah I've tried to play
the long game and I think this is this
is a space probably any space but
especially this one you have to play the
long game you can't be needy like the
client needs to need the coach more than
the coach needs the client that's the
only way it's going to work um but
anyway I I I really appreciate that well
said well said Thank you Nathan this is
awesome appreciate the time man okay all
