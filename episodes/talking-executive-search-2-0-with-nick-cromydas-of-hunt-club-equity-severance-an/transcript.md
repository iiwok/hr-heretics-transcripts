hey everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics so Nick you are the CEO of Hunt
Club can you tell us what Hunt Club is
and what was the founding Insight yeah
and Nolan Kelly thanks for having me I
love listening to everything you produce
so I appreciate it so founded the
business in really actually it was funny
it was started in 2014 and it was built
out of a incubator that I was running a
venture studio called new Coast Ventures
and the the Insight in creating the
business and really we got really going
in 16 17 but the Insight was really
predicated on I had a good friend that
was a partner at a large executive
Search firm and he kept winning a bunch
of digital oriented searches so think of
doing a SVP of Performance Marketing or
chief digital or product officer and the
funny thing was he was a
really focused in consumer products and
sort of traditional brand marketing so
he didn't actually understand how
digital played that big of a lens in in
general in marketing and so so basically
he would call me up and say hey Nick I
just won this you know s of Performance
Marketing search what is Performance
Marketing and that that was kind of how
it started and I knew nothing about the
recruiting industry I I certainly like
was investing in companies and starting
companies and adding people to the team
but I didn't quite understand how
external search worked
and so he'd come by the office you know
late afternoons and barter with a
sixpack of beer or something and we'd
sit there for an hour and I'd walk them
through okay here's what Performance
Marketing does and here's how you spend
money on Facebook ads and here's how
they think about sort of quantitatively
driving impact and and generally like
show them a couple buckets of personas
that that would be a good fit and we get
to the end of the conversation be like
oh I saw you're connected to those
people can you can you introduce me and
I did that for five different searches
over like basically a four Monon period
And I actually placed five people for
them and so that was the start of the
business five of five Nick it's
incredible yeah well well there there
were some misses in there too so I I
would actually yeah five to seven intros
for search and one would hit so okay so
so explain to the audience how hunk club
actually works then right cuz like I
understand it is a network based
executive Search firm but like get us
under the hood and explain what exactly
that means and how it actually works
with the Dynamics yeah of course so like
Piggy backing off that story you know
what we believe in hun club and how it
actually works is we think of a bit
ourselves ourselves as search for 2.0
what that means is we built all our own
technology to power our end to end
process internally to try and create a
more transparent and efficient
experience so things like if you were to
use a traditional search firm and you
hire them for a search it might take
them two to four weeks to put together a
long list of candidates that they want
to pursue and Market that's something
that we can do in in minutes with AI
things like Outreach whereas they really
have Associates generally doing Outreach
on their behalf to to drum up
conversations and schedule meetings to
just qualify if someone's interested we
build Automation and quite a few tools
to do that and so it's really taking all
these parts that are quite
administrative and or human oriented and
building efficiencies for it and then
the other part that we do that I think
is our big differentiator is we use a
network of thousands of leaders to help
you find your next grade higher so what
that means is if we're doing the VP of
marketing search for Dollar Shave Club
we have hundreds of CMOS across the
country who sign up drop their LinkedIn
their Gmail their contact networks in
their own platform we see who they know
we build technology to map the strength
of their relationships so we can really
crowdsource referrals from people that
have been there and done that and so the
whole vision of our businesses we really
want to integrate subject matter experts
leaders people that really understand an
industry and or of a great network of
high quality talent that they can help
our clients find awesome you know
opportunities or at least awesome people
in their Network for those opportunities
and then we pair that with a full
service search consultant so you still
work with a great talent partner
recruiter you'll work closely to help
Define what the role is you work closely
with them to scope and and get into the
market and qualify candidates all the
way to setting up a hiring process
negotiating closing but we can tag these
amazing experts along either the entire
Journey or just in the referral process
to to help you really get it right and
we think given the complexity of how
hard it is to get the right person and
how skill sets are changing that the the
only way to fully like find the total
addressable canid pool is through all
these different networks of of people
that really know the market quite well
and so that's the business we just the
simple form is like we think about
recruiting with trust and there's no
better way to find your next game
changer than an introduction from
someone that has lived and breathed the
role and know someone that would be
great for it yeah I I love that I mean
you're crowdsourcing the search like
essentially which is cool I mean I get
calls every week hey who do you know who
do you know who do you know and you've
been around for eight years I've never
heard of you well we're we're doing a
bad job on my end an expert acquisition
Kelly after this call I'm gonna call you
or send you an email you gotta become an
expert and be part of the community I
mean I I might also be under a rock I
mean it could be that too but like why
am I not on it's it's incredible you're
not like we actually took a very well I
don't know if you're under a rock maybe
not but like we we've taken like a
really kind of more methodical approach
I mean we've grown fast as a venture
back to business but we really curated
every single expert one by one many of
them come as like finalists or silver
medalists as part of our search process
and we think that builds a super
authentic relationship and if you
pattern match like the manual Behavior
what happens in this industry a partner
will call which you well know but like a
partner will call his candidate pool or
her candidate pool and say hey I've got
the search who do you know and we're
building the same mechanism as that just
digitally so so most of our experts
actually come as former candidats in a
search so if I'm an agency are you my
friend or my enemy like do you help me
or do you take my clients well probably
hopefully take your clients now I'm
kidding look I think the Market's
massive right because I could see both I
could see how both would be true I'm
just curious like you know right now
we're focused on being sort of our own
vertically integrated solution across
the board so use our own technology cool
only use our referral Network to provide
value to our clients and provide service
to our clients I mean I think there's a
future in a world where we offer some of
that to a wide variety of other
customers and we already have a software
business that we're selling to venture
growth equity and private Equity to
power their own networks in unique ways
but right now we we don't have any sort
of plans in the immediate future to
offer our our technology and network to
other firms yeah so Nick one of my
founding insights with Contin
was executive Search is really expensive
it's really slow and there's very little
technology involved and when when I
first started building the business my
initial take was like why are humans a
part of this thing like at all and that
ended up being wrong because I have
found that companies especially CEOs
that are running exec level surges want
a person to work with them they want a
throat to choke like they want a partner
as part of the search talk to me a
little bit about like what you have
learned as part of this journey and how
it's been a little bit different than
what you initially thought yeah yeah
well I think like one of the more it's a
really good Insight noan so like one of
the reasons we started this version of
the business versus more of a
Marketplace connecting to people without
sort of any human in the loop is that
what we always believed is to really
matchmake credibly on both sides you
need a qualified person really guiding
and shepher in both sides and so I don't
I actually don't think there's a world
especially in like professional search
to executive Search where you can really
long-term disintermediate the consultant
or the recruiter I then you can Empower
them in a ton of different ways and I
think it's for like really simple
reasons like hiring in today's world's
complex maybe a consultant helping you
evaluate and structure what skill sets
you need can be a huge value add to the
process or how about like really
credible talents Talent candidates are
quite busy like someone building a white
glove process for them and getting them
engaged in a process and working closely
with them to decide if it's the right
fit or not like actually helps
materially like bring a transaction
forward or Executives who are so busy
and this may be a priority but you know
there's a thousand other things as you
both have sat in your seats that you
need to do Beyond building your own team
to keep a business running that it's
it's hard so I think like the gravity of
everything that a person or executive or
hiring manager does is heavy and no one
can really just Ely explicitly focus on
this one thing and then I also think you
know really to do it right someone
shepher in that process and making sure
biases and or moments in time are not as
much of a part of the qualification as
well as like really getting to the
important factors that might make a
great partnership so I I think it's I'm
with you I think technology can make
people more productive I think Network
effects can create unfair advantages for
accessing awesome talent but I really
believe that in especially in the senior
part of the market and even the middle
sort of mid senior of the market there's
always going to have to be a human
component to this and you take
candidates all the way through the end
correct Nick offer except the whole
thing okay so you're seen Trends Data
Insights across what I would think would
be multiple Industries and multiple
functions yeah yeah we work across a
wide variety from you know consumer Tech
to Consumer products and goods to
healthcare to retail Healthcare to
health Tech to SAS all across the board
so the team's about 60 70 people on the
search side business about 130 people so
we're fortunate to kind of see a pretty
high velocity of different things great
so Kelly and I have had a debate and you
I think I think I'm going to take an L
on this one but like let help us settle
this debate so how many so there's this
notion of Executives pre-negotiated
Severance which essentially means as
part of the offer agreement the exec and
the CEO of the the company get to an
arrangement on what the s will be if
they get fired how often is this coming
up so I'd say on cxo searches so Chief
anything north of 95% of the time the
only area where I don't see it sometimes
is kind of seed preed where perhaps an
exac is actually more of a manager and
or sort of director leveling in their
phase of the career but for call it like
post series B companies for cxo 95% of
the time for SVP slvp maybe it's 30 to
 
you seeing differences by industry like
like I'm most familiar with SAS right
Enterprise SAS is that true I'm assuming
it is for different Industries as well
or is it a bit
different I think and so our our lens is
very much private Equity Venture growth
equity and then some sort of public Co
public code but it's a smaller balance
of our customer portfolio we're seeing
it pretty much across the board and I
think also especially given the last
like two or three years and some of the
volatility of the private Capital
Community and and some of these
businesses right that I think executives
are getting more in tune and in
protecting sort of the the potential for
a transition just given the the volume
of reductions or change management or
just like as simple as okay you did a
great job your first year but the
business requires a totally different
skill set for year two and three right
so so so we're we're seeing it at a
pretty high velocity wow okay so Kelly
you were right well yeah I mean you know
what I mean like I I love to see
everything at all angles and noan was
coming at it as like what you're you're
just protecting yourself if you're
shitty getting fired and I was like well
it feels like a red flag yeah my take is
it's a red flag right and then what Nick
was saying which I was saying is is
actually when that when that doesn't
happen and something happens it's out of
their control that kind of comes up very
quickly and technically it's written
like that right Nick I mean technically
it's written if you are let go without
cause which I know in the end is blah
blah blah it's hard to you know no one's
like they're getting it anyway I'm like
yes they are but technically it's in the
offer letter that it's protected only if
you know without cause yeah if you're
you're which means you're fired right
like you get fired and so so Nick the
the thing I want to understand is you
know now that you're saying 95% or more
of cxo searches have some sort of
pre-negotiated severance what do the
terms typically look like I can imagine
a world to where they're very bespoke
but I can also Imagine given that you
guys are seeing these all the time that
you could say well actually this is more
market for a role like this so what are
the terms that you typically see yeah so
for you I'll give you a couple different
lenses so call like pre-series V series
V to Growth Company growth stage company
and then larger sort of publicco so so
precede it could be one to two months
pre sorry below series B it could be one
to two months and and 90% of the time
it's something just super clean that
says if this person's let go for
anything that cause they get whatever X
part of their Severance agreement and so
that's more the simpler version from
series B plus it could be anywhere call
it like two to four months generally a
sort of range and then beyond that all
sorts of unique things around
accelerated vesting and you know six to
 
whistles the largest scale executive
yeah and so I I would say that the most
frequent terms that one might negotiate
are size of seance from A month's
perspective acceleration of vesting so
in the event that you know you're you're
six months into your second year you
finish the final year and or finish a
percentage of your package if it's not
for cause so that happens
occasionally and and I think th those
are probably like the two most
negotiated terms sometimes there are
things like wave of non-compete wave of
non-solicit in the event that something
like that happens but it's way less
frequent than the other
two hey everyone we'll be right back in
a moment after a word from our sponsors

Heretics here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is is possible and it
can even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recoiled at the thought of a static
internet that looks like something you
built in 1995 using Ms paint have no
fear work Vivo is a dynamic intuitive
accessible and mobile First Tool people
actually like using it which is why
companies like Ryan a General virgin and
more have rolled it out to hundreds of
thousands of
employees work vivo's activity feeds

we sit at a desk or drive a truck make
work Vivo the digital part of your
organization and Achieve Limitless human
connection head to work vivo.com to book
a demo and make sure you tell them that
Nolan and Kelly from HR heretic
 
say the other question I have on kind of
bespoke executive offer letters is
single and double trigger acceleration
yeah so how often how often does that
come
up so inventure back company I think
it's pretty boiler plate for an
executive to get double trigger for
private Equity we see single trigger for
certain types of roles pretty frequently
but I think the truth is like as you
work with some more more and more season
executive that's been through like
multiple transactions they kind of
realize that it's nice to have that term
for protection but whatever happens as a
deal or an m&amp;a deal is actually getting
negotiation those terms have a pretty
high probability of being
restructured usually in like some
egregiously favorable way for the
executive or in in some form fashion
right but like if they're buying a t a
business more times than not they want
to maintain or retain some of the
leadership team and so the terms get
generally retr based on the point of
acquisition and so I'd say like double
trigger is pretty par for the course
single trigger less common unless a
company's moderately distressed Andor
it's more of a private Equity shaped
deal and those are the things for joh
yeah that's something that I didn't
realize early on in my career noan and
is like that's great for your offer
letter here but as you're negotiating a
deal like all that ink gets wet like
very fast you know what to think the
least undern goti term that I find is
incredibly late exercise so I was gonna
ask that next yeah it's I I actually
think as an executive like the 90
frankly just as a teammate like I get
both sides of the equation why a 90day
shot clock is whether not a teammate
should exercise their options is a good
thing for the business to make sure
they're having the right option pool to
deploy to grow in the company like 90
days isn't a whole lot of time and like
coming up with the cash in the event
that business is moderately successful
that could be a really stressful thing
but from the executive side like I
actually think like most should try and
at least go in for at least you know six
to 12 months late exercise or even push
it to to a p liquidity event if they can
right because then you're not cash out
of pocket you can sort of take a
percentage of your earnings and deploy
towards we've had many passionate
conversations about this yeah and we're
very much aligned with you that 0 days
is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and it's just it's just the
default because it's been the default
yeah especially and maybe like you tear
it so if someone's been there for over
two years or three years they get like a
year Cliff someone sub two years maybe
it's 90 days or 180 days I think there's
some ways that you can mechanize it but
to honor people that have helped you
build your business but yeah I'm with
you like I think it's I was talking to
somebody today that had to go take out a
line of credit from their personal bank
to go pay for their options right and
like they're paying 7% interest now on
that line of credit it might be a year
and a half to three years before
liquidity happens given the markets and
it's just it's a really hard thing to
ask someone who's helped build a
business to do 100% I knew someone that
went down to the bank and took a $3
million loan yeah yeah and oh my God and
there's a thousand ways goes sideways
right like totally so we we love equity
on this show Nick and we continue to be
surprised ourselves included at like the
level that we need to improve our
knowledge around Equity everyone does
and we've gotten a lot of comments thank
you because it's surprising that even
Executives they miss stuff with Equity
all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time so I'd love to hear
like what are you seeing like what what
what like what's your range that you're
seeing with Executives and their their
like knowledge their sophistication
around equity and what are some
surprises that they're just like let me
help you with this how do you not know
this I think the only ones that really
the only function it's not going to be
surprising that really understands it
incredibly well is a two to three time
post outcome CFO like like that that is
kind of the only person I've ever seen
like okay strike price okay I get it
whatever I have to pay for my options I
get it late EX excise coupled with like
early exercise to shave off AMT taxes
like there's like it's it's so complex I
don't understand why it can't be simpler
um but very few actually truly get it
and you know I think it's and it's not
meant to be simple right like I don't
know why we haven't thought about a less
complex construct for this but but you
know things like okay what was the
preferred what preferred preference
stack on the cap table how much Capital
has been raised what's my 409a
what are what are the theoretical
Quantum of multiples the business can be
valued at and then making like a
relatively educated decision okay the
business is raised $20 million it's
doing one million in Revenue it's
growing 20% year-over year 10% year-over
year it's going to run out of cash in
two years like I should probably not
exercise because there's $20 million on
the preference stack ahead of me and
then inversely right like people that
walk away
from there's just one person that that
we know that we we worked with to find
an opportunity and I worked really hard
to coach him to exercise his options
because he had such a biased lens of
what was happening in the company based
on his own experience and I think that's
also like a thing people always fall
into the Trap of it's like you were
there for two years you had a bad
experience on the way out you don't want
to be a shareholder and then like a year
later the business exited for $500
million and you would have made $4
million and you didn't exercise his
options because of his own impact on the
way out yeah emotional decision yeah so
I think there's a lot of work we can do
as a community to really educate and I
think the challenge though is like it
does actually take like investment of
time and talking to accountants and
talking to a wide range of people and I
I would actually like at certain point
like to see the community shift the
instrument that we use versus uh having
to really sort of educate because I do
you know I think we I've raised a bit of
venture for our business I've been
investing for 12 years there's a lot I
don't understand and like
yeah I think we just make it easier for
everybody totally if I had if I had to
highlight one that I wish I would have
gotten smart on 14 years ago when I
started Adventure it was this preferred
common Dynamic and what that means
because you don't really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] think
about it like you see your shares on the
offer letter and that's all you think
about right you forget about liquidation
preferences and that's that's the that's
the thing attached to that is
liquidation preferences in addition to
that is the main thing
yeah and no one and I think it I think
look I think like Founders and companies
and some of our clients are in a little
bit of a rock and a hard place right how
do you if you're trying to preserve
shareholder value and have a chance to
build a business that creates some
liquidity for everyone involved
including your teammates if you were to
communicate to them that we're all
underwater on our rsus or options and
for us to actually actually achieve a
hurdle or we create value for ourselves
you have to get to X Revenue growth
and the probability of that is 10% Like
what do you think would happen to your
your employee base right so it's it's
really hard I think the best companies I
know of are being super honest and
direct and deliberate and then doing a
lot of really creative things like
management carve outs we get the entire
management team or the employee team
gets you know x amount of million
dollars for every threshold that we exit
the business irrespective of our Equity
right in our position or or other sort
of bonus incentives that at least help
to offset it and I think that's a going
to be a really helpful construct for for
the state of tech and what it is today
given how lopsided things are that's a
really interesting solve to having
companies that are overvalued today yeah
yeah it's like PE does it all the time
right it's it's they don't actually give
you a percentage of the business they
just give you a cash lug based on
outcome Horizons I think we should we as
like Tech should think about that right
because maybe maybe you're like okay the
business is valuated at a billion
dollars and I think there's a 10% chance
of us achieving growth over that but if
we have any liquidity event above 500
million or 3 million everyone in the
team gets X based on whatever their
ownership right is and like just
incentivizing a different way that's a
great idea I guess like so you you had
made the point earlier around like
single and double trigger getting
renegotiated during m&amp;a events I'm
assuming that these could also get
renegotiated during an m&amp;a event so it's
a good it's a good idea but like you
know let's see what the buyer says hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after a word from our sponsors Real Talk
most Talent leaders haven't yet cracked
how to leverage AI for Meaningful impact
on their hiring processes and business
goals but the leaders who are
effectively using AI to transform their
recruiting teams efficiency and quality
use metaview metaview is the AI
assistant for the interview process
their AI records and transcribes hiring
conversations like intakes interviews
and debriefs then provides perfectly
summarized notes of everything that was
discussed that means your people can
focus on creating human connections with
candidates during calls and save time on
the busy work of cleaning up notes after
every interview but it's so much more
than just a timesaver because perfect
notes means perfect data for every
candidate in every pipeline hiring teams
can make confident informed decisions
and talent leaders can finally take
control of the interview process join

[Music]
peel yeah yeah well I also think like
it's in these instances it would come
out of the um investor basis pool not
necessarily the acquir right if the
acquir says your business raised 100
million and we're buying you for 20
million or 10 million there's probably
not a lot you can do if the business
raises 100 million and someone will
require for 100 million there's probably
a way that all shareholders can work
together to incentivize a
transaction that I have not heard Kelly
I haven't heard that at all and I think
that that's a tremendous idea for
companies that are in this weird
position of we've raised a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of
money and we are now overvalued but we
have a real business like we have a real
business and it's very hard for us to
recruit given this inflated valuation
Nick I haven't heard that before Kelly
have you heard that I I haven't and I I
might you know I'm going to go on a limb
here because we're all safe space and
Nick can tell me if I'm wrong but living
in Venture the past 14 years especially
the past two years I feel like the PE
side has a bit more flexibility and flex
around cash and and to do that right on
on on our side and I'm seeing it
everywhere it's like survival it's cash
it's trying to extend Runway not have to
raise it's trying to get cash flow
positive I mean the money bags are like
gripped very tight and I I feel like the
PE backed firms have some more cash to
play with that so that's my hypothesis I
think you're right in just sort of the
flexibility of the structure but I think
look at the end of the day if a
transaction is forced by Venture
investors to get acquired by a company
that company will still need likely the
participation of key employees executive
teams those building the product to go
along for a certain period of time and I
think that's a leverage point that a FEC
Venture investor could change the
construct and I I actually think too
Kelly like it actually happens more than
you might think where where Venture back
companies get some sort of management or
employee carve out to go incentivize a
transaction it's just not widely spoke
about by anybody because I don't think
the Venture Community wants to arm the
founding and or management Community
with more Tools in their toolkit but
it's also something that if if a company
is employing a pretty good attorney
they'll they'll think about a different
construct to make sure at least sort of
outcomes and thank you Nick for for
arming the community now yeah that
information I agree I'm I'm thinking
about it as a recruiting strategy like
you know because it's because many
companies are in this boat of we are
real but we're just overvalued and
there's not much you know you've taken
the valuation there's not really much
you can do about that today and so I
think it's a way that you could actually
still recruit you know high-powered
Executives and get you know assuage
their fears of like well what's my
liquidity actually going to be you know
I'm I'm joining an early stage company
because I want a multiple on these
options and I'm thinking about it as
like man maybe we get a 1x here yeah you
I think the way that we generally
position it for our customers is like
you sort of spell out like the almost
irr or return or annual comp in an
annual basis right so like if you did
like a$3 to four million management
carve out for key executive upon
liquidity not upon exit above certain
thresholds then you can kind of talk to
me like look like if you're here for
three or four years and then we hit like
this base case scenario which is the
board approved plan you still would make
your base plus whatever carve out over X
period of time and I actually think in a
lot of ways it makes it more real too
right so because just have to exit
company versus versus hit a threshold
I love that okay let's talk about good
interview processes and and maybe also
bad interview processes so what do you
see as like you know the best run exec
interview processes like what are these
companies doing that that other
companies are not the best are really
really sharpening their pencil up front
for days weeks sometimes even a month on
scorecard cross functional executive
alignment
archetypes to pursue and the pro pros
and cons of those archetypes and then
like really creating a thoughtful and
spoke search strategy based on the
sharpening of that and I think and then
there's obviously a wide variety of
other things you can do once you
actually engage in the process we can go
through but I actually find the number
one way that any company can create
Leverage is to actually invest in that
upfront process and rotate it over a
couple different times to make sure you
have clear alignment and a clear thesis
on what you want to go to market with or
go find in market and when someone does
that I think you just have a way higher
probability for Success right because
you're looking at two or three different
shapes of a candidate that could be a
good fit versus just I need this
specific unicorn you have a scorecard
that aligns the strengths and weaknesses
of each archetype and you've gotten your
entire executive team and or team
aligned with that this is going to be
the process and this is what we believe
in and here's the pros and cons so
that's I think the thing that I'd love
to see happen more often like anytime we
kick off a search for our client there's
usually three pieces of work product
archetypes a scorecard and Sample
candidates per each archetype and we
think it's important to kind of put all
of that on paper and then circulated
around their exact team to make sure
people are really kind of aligned on
what we're doing how do you feel about
the notion of a like a working session
Nick a presentation a working session
you know kind of a mock staff meeting
type discussion love it love it I love
it yeah I think because when you're in
the room asking questions sparring with
each other pointing things out I think
you can pretty quickly understand
someone's working style understand do
they take or give energy when you're
interacting with them and all these
things that are so complex to actually
figure out in an interview process a
traditional screen and assess move on
process so I'm I'm a huge proponent of
it and like going back to some of the
stuff that we talked about knowing like
also like this sort of fractional model
like work together before you start
working together and a wide variety
other sort of Project based work I think
is an awesome way to just deris the
thing for everybody now it's not just
the company it's you know someone
signing up to be here for two to four
years of their life is that common
though is that working session optional
is it required does it
depend we don't see it nearly as much as
we would like we see way more
routine you know sort of executive
meetings um traditional interview
process some Sometimes some social
outings like we're dinner with a team
things like that which we we of course
always encourage but I would love to see
more companies you know really kind of
have structured working sessions where
they as a team invite somebody in to
actually help be a participant on on a
problem or issue and understand how they
integrate it's it continues to surprise
me that it's not a more common practice
especially given what is on the line
when you're hiring an exec because
you're typically not just hiring them
they're bringing in their leadership
team they're hiring a bunch of people
they're changing your culture and so
what do the detracting companies have to
say about work trials and like you know
advising before full-time employment
like what is their what is their
argument why isn't it happening they we
don't have time or we yeah why isn't
this happening more it feels like so
obvious yeah I think it's just it's a
lot of work to structure that and you
both have said on leadership teams right
like how many of your leadership
meetings were actually like super high
quality interactions it's a lot of work
and hopefully for both of you like
they're all great right like but but I
think even like see it seems like less
work than a dinner I'm going to throw
that out
there yeah but a dinner is like social
it's easy you just book a reservation
and make people get there like to
actually create an hour meeting in that
structure where you're inviting a
candidate to partake and have them be a
part of the discussion and have them
engage in a topic that they have enough
information on but they want have so
much is is actually hard and so I think
it's just the work of doing it up front
and and really specking it and
understanding the knowledge base of the
candidate and then creating a framework
that actually is you know appropriate
for for them to be pulled in in a way
where they can they can show their best
selves but also recognize that they
don't have all the answers yet because
they don't work there yep talk to me
about executive feedback so I have a lot
of friends who especially in the last
two years have been really frustrated by
the interview process with companies
their take is hey you know I've been
interviewing with all these companies I
get no feedback when I interact with the
company so what's your take on giving
execs feedback as part of the interview
process during the process or after the
process I think both both is is is
definitely what I'm interested in I am
huge proponent of it I think
transparency honest transparency about
where there are concerns and then having
a direct dialogue about those concerns
on both sides every step of the way I
think makes for a wonderful partnership
and I think too often companies
mask those concerns or share it amongst
them the leadership team but they don't
actually share back to the candidate and
candidates have their concerns and they
don't share it with the company and then
like one breaks up without really truly
saying what they felt or meant and I
think I think look I think like when you
think about most the times when things
don't work out in a in a process maybe
 
right like somebody AB or seed and show
wellow I don't have explicit experience
or there's a concern around this but I
think there's 20% of the time where you
might have a really special candidate if
you were head first and addressing
whatever the concern was and then
hearing an honest authentic take as to
why or why not that is an issue and vice
versa on the on the uh candidate like
I've there's only been out of our
clients we've probably done a couple
thousand searches now there's only
probably been a handful where our
clients have like actually gone the
depth and the distance with each other
to really have a heavily informed
opinion about who the person is and what
the business is right and I know that's
crazy right but like especially in 2021
and 22 if Talent is incredibly hard to
find people are switching but every
single CID will have three to five
offers you kind of are forced to play at
a different speed and absorb some risks
and so I I love the world to shift to
just more transparent view like hey I
love this business I love the idea of
this business I hate your growth rate I
have questions about your vpm marketing
I have concerns about product Market fit
and I don't love the valuation let's
talk about those things right in a way
that's digestible for sure um you know
we I told this story in a webinar this
week but we had at door Dash we had a
bias against hiring EXC
consultants and there was this guy who
had seven years of experience at delit
and we got all the way through their
process and and everybody had this
concern because we had had a couple not
work out and I remember picking up the
phone and calling him and being like and
I'll use his name AJ like hey this is
the main concern man like we we really
like you but we just don't we haven't
seen this translate well and just by
putting that on the table he then went
on the offensive to sell me about why he
was different and why he was going to be
successful and he knew coming in that
this was going to be the bias against
him you we're all humans like we do have
bias as much as we try and remove it and
he went on to be a VP you know like he
went on to absolutely kill it in the
company and I think part of the reason
why is because we were very clear with
him at the outset I wish there was more
candidness and transparency in the
interview process because look at the
end of the day we're all trying to be
performative and then you get in and
you're working with somebody and it's
like you're spending more time with
these people than you are with your
family like let's try and get this right
please yeah on both sides right we
actually had a candidate get an offer
recently and we coach the candidate to
really go deep on one or two different
things with our client and they went
deep for a two or three hour session and
they told our client I really want this
job but I'm not the right fit for it
like and I think like people need to
reframe and look I was gonna say this
but I think the other side of this like
I was gonna say people need to reframe
their perspective on taking a job versus
just versus like really getting it right
in a way where like it's mutually
fulfilling you're driving impact and
value but I think the other challenge of
this right is like
people have mortgages and people have
you know 529 BS and child payments and
all these things and PR paying rent and
pressure and feeding their families like
so there's always going to be that level
of fishering in the marketplace right
because company needs and human needs
will not always balance perfectly and
and and candidates and talent won't
always have the luxury to find perfect
versus what supports their lifestyle
their family and whatever M right so I
totally agree with that and and
something we've talked about a lot Nick
is like when you hire and exec it's a
 
given the thousands of searches you've
seen do you agree with that I think I
think it's probably pretty close to that
ratio I think you're can do things to
move the needle by 10 to 20% up to 60 to
 
I think humans are people like we had
this amazing candidate that signed
crushed it out the gates the first 90
days had a really unfortunate family
death was a totally different human
being the rest of their tenure there and
didn't succeed in the role because they
weren't able to focus on it and look
that's like a really straightforward
example but I also think like people are
human and humans change their
perspective changes constantly and I
think you can get absolutely everything
right on paper on culture but a moment
in time can change somebody materially
in a huge way and and I think that's the
thing we all deal with as Talent leaders
is is that's the imperfection that
always be there y
totally talk to us about back channels
so we've had this conversation a few
times as
well I think back channels are generally
positive I think it's how you run them
where people really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up but what's
your take how often do you see it where
does it go right where does it go wrong
yeah so I think going back to the first
part of our conversation if you build a
really transparent process where you're
isolating the things that you actually
want to back Channel directly to the
candidate and then maybe even asking
them directly to share people that can
sort of refute that or give you an
honest perspective on it I think you can
remove actually back channels from the
process and and really work
authentically with a candidate the the
inverse of that is like it takes a
pretty
mature both sides of the marketplace to
do that well and it's really complex to
do that so I I do think there's a
there's a place for a informal reference
as long as there's a really deliberate
thing that you're looking for and a very
deliberate point of view that you're
trying to assess right and I think to
often it's it's is this person good or
not it's like were they good in your
company your culture the size business
the stage the business model what was
impacting them in their life that year
like it's so the depth and the rigor of
the questions and the framing that a
consultant should take should be so
pinpointed that you're really
specifically trying to understand the
landscape and understand a very specific
thing right I think that's where
everybody screws it up everybody like
we've we've had inal references as we've
hired people for Hunt Club that were
incredibly negative but we we still
hired some of these people because the
negative thing was actually a positive
for what they might do in our business
right and so so it's it's like within
the context of what and then time is the
other Factor right it's like my brother
is still 5 years old to me and he's not
he's 44 years old and you you like have
people and they they stick in your mind
as they were years before and to no
one's point this bias it's just never
ending yeah it's it's it's a really
interesting point Nick because like
basically today people think I think
most people think about it is this
checklist and they're going through like
okay like I'm going to ask the candidate
for references like check that box now
I'm going to go do back channels like
check that box and the the more
interesting thing is diving into that
and saying like what exactly are you
looking for like what is the thing that
you need to get signal on that is O an
open question in your mind that is going
to swing you from like I like this
person to I love this person and they're
perfect for us or like our culture or
how we work and I I had a I had one last
week for a former direct report and I'm
talking to the CEO and 15 minutes of the
conversation ends and he's like anything
else you think I should know and I was
like yeah actually a lot like don't know
anything about your company I don't know
anything about your culture and how you
guys work yeah I answered your questions
but I don't think you know anything
about this person based off of the
conversation we just had yeah and I
think I think like the right if you were
to frame the right informal referencer
back Channel it should probably be like
 
then five minutes of questions about the
individual right and I think like that
gives at least somebody the frame of
reference to make a qualified decision
on their experience that's maybe
relevant or not look unless it's like
you're trying to spot check something
that happened that is a really quick yes
or
no then I think there's sometimes can be
a different but I think 978 eight% of
back channels should run that way it's
it's also the framing on it too right
like it used to be hey should I hire
this person are they good or not and
they'd be like yes they're good because
they want to help them versus hey we've
already decided to hire this person like
we we we're going to give them an offer
they're going to come work with us so no
need to like you know blow smoke tell
me how I can help them right how how how
I can the best how I can help them and
now they're not protecting they're like
oh you've asked Nolan to go live with
you he doesn't BR he his bathrooms messy
right they're they're like it's less
heavy and that's been very effective
Kelly I I love that the other thing I
like to do with candidates is to be very
clear with them that we are going to
back Channel as part of the assessment
piece of the process and give and say
like look we're going to do this because
it gives a signal that we otherwise
wouldn't get is there anyone we
shouldn't reach out to and then give
them the opportunity to pull the rip
cord on it and be like hey don't touch
this person for XYZ reason and then then
you can start asking questions there of
like if there any red flags that show up
but that way you're putting things on
the table and you're establishing trust
in the relationship versus what back
channels are happening today is their
removing trust yes really quickly
because you're not talking to the person
about it and they're like wait the hell
you called my old CEO and like didn't
tell me about it that's weird right and
you can test their honesty right it's
like hey I'm going to reach out to like
all these people what am I going to hear
like good Bad and the Ugly what what
what is that and then are they
self-reflective are they honest about
what they might hear and they can
explain why with their own context
around why you might hear that and now
you get situation context on top of the
honesty should do that too no I feel
like Canon should back Channel people
that have left the company right what
was it what was it like like what was
the culture how was growth like I think
that it's funny I feel like if companies
run some sort of referencing process 90%
of the time candidates maybe only run it
five to 10 percent at a time and I think
we need to improve upon that as an
ecosystem too and if you do it as a
candidate you got to also play with the
same rules because the company could
have been different the like that that
context has to play both ways versus oh
was terrible five years ago I'm not
going so well said both of you okay Nick
I want to last question is I want to
talk about the the future of exec search
it feels like we're on the precipice of
really big change and you know what I've
been hearing from companies is like hey
I'm I'm not using exec search as much
I'm going through my own individual
networks I feel like this cost and the
ROI like they they just don't match up
anymore it also feels like search firms
have been resistant to using technology
and now we have ai in coming in a really
really big way so just what's your take
on the future of executive Search and
where's it going yeah I think I think
like the trends last couple years you
know obviously rooted in a lot of
different ways it's one of the more
complex environments for interest rates
and macro fears and obviously a pullback
in Venture and growth Equity so I do
think you'll see quite a bit of
resurgence as interest rates contract
and companies start to grow in sort of
more meaningful way and capital frees up
but I think as far as the the future of
executive Search look I think probably
two or three things one if companies
aren't using technology and like
actually figuring out what their AI
strategy is and not just like put it in
their quarterly earnings call we're a
tech company now and we've started this
digital component of our business but
like truly innovating and then building
the space and the freedom to
innovate I don't know if they're going
to be around in a few years or they're
going to have to Pivot their business
model to more leadership advisory and
when you think about like what's
happening in the largest part of the
market Market you're seeing this
diversification of almost every major
firm go from we used to do search 30 40
years ago to now we do quite a bit of
leadership advisory quite a bit of
search quite a bit of other things um
whether it's acquiring staffing firms or
acquiring fractional consulting firms or
fractional Talent firms right so people
are really diversifying out of it and
most of those business models actually
don't have a ton of digital as well
they're just they're building more
diverse portfolio and I think the
primary reason for that is they're they
recognize they don't have the cultures
to actually innovate every single search
firm for the most part at any sort of
scale mostly operates as its own sort of
thiefdom of a partner an associate an
engagement manager and maybe an AA
running in their own practice line
focusing on their own billing and caring
about the culture of the firm in some
way but really caring about their own
p&amp;l and so if you have let's just say
your four to 500 person firm with 200
Partners 200 300 partners those two
partners maybe care about the growth of
the firm but they certainly care about
their own Billings and so I think that's
going to present a huge challenge for
every single firm out there and so from
technology not being used and partners
who are quite good at they do not having
an incentive to use it to firms not
really working as a team sport because
passing relationships to each other
could be bad for their own bottom line
to the introduction of AI in a lot of
different ways I think the most
disruption we've ever seen in the
industry is coming over the next 20
years and and I also think like the
biggest thing that I think is
understated is if you were to pull you
know basically anybody working in a
techish company and ask them who any of
the Shrek firms
are the probability of them knowing
their names and what they do if they
haven't gotten past series C or D is
probably some 20% it's like oh I know
corn Ferry because I watch golf right
like or like I've heard of so and so and
no knock against corn faery but like
like the next generation of Executives
is not going to use a firm with two
names on a door and so like I think if
they don't start to innovate if they
don't refresh their talent pool if they
don't start solving problems that are
interesting to their Consulting base and
and figure out ways to do search better
as a team versus sort of pockets of
mercenary groups I just don't believe
they're going to be nearly around in the
same way in 20 years I think they're
going to be there leadership advisory
portfolio of different services and
offering I just have a hard time
believing they'll be able to compete in
search well said yep well said Nick
thank you so much for the time this was
excellent thanks
