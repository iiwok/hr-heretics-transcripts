hey everybody Welcome Back To HR
Heretics today we have Casey woo joining
us so Casey's been a longtime friend and
he's one of the most interesting people
I've ever met and part of the reason why
is his background so Casey went from a
public market invest
to a five time exec at VC backed
companies either as a CFO coo
combo then you started operators Guild
which is the best community for CFOs
Coos and chap people officers and then
you parlayed operators Guild into a VC
firm so Casey we're stoked to have you
on man thank you for having me it's a
pleasure to be here so you know we've
known each other since uh you know I
tried to hire you at door Dash and I've
tried to hire you at Carta uh
unfortunately we couldn't get it done
you're you're my white whale so one of
these days we will work together but
there's a ton of things that we can talk
about I actually want to talk about weor
and you worked at Wei workor during the
Heyday of crazy weor and I just want to
know what was it like working with Adam
Newman so I think a little known random
statistic I'm going to create out of
thin air is nine out of 10 Wei workers
would do it all over
again I think a lot of people confuse it
with
Theros or like
FTX to be clear weor was not a fraud
weor was a mismanaged financial thing
with a great product it lives today so
once again not being defensive but
that's the first thing I think when
people ask me about
is there's this like it's going to be
this like fraudulent stories and all
that and no it's
um it was one of the most special
moments of my what I call tours of Duty
as an operator we work as a very rare
situation where you got billions of
dollars literally not figuratively to
build as fast as a human could
build I take it as one of the most
incredible business
school things paid for by someone else
because when it comes to operating one
of the biggest variables of
sophistication or skill level is rate of
change in
speed I have a whole analogy where it's
it's like there's Navy Seals and there's
people who like are not
them they're at a high stakes no margin
of error type of situation it's a
different type of War fighting and we
work it's a different type of business
building so to be a part of that was
just pretty awesome like they just like
call what it is and you take away things
from there at that type of speed and
you'd appreciate it from the hiring
standpoint it's like like how Facebook
you know it got to a point where there's
like hiring like 300 a month in one
region right across every function so
the so there's that now your question
wasn't that your question was Adam every
founder their DNA bleeds through the
culture doesn't matter how big it is uh
travel so you can see the
aggressiveness right Steve Jobs you know
is the product quality in the market it
doesn't matter um Elon the technology
element of
things Adam was the
social
energy people joke that we were a
cult I think between there's a fine line
between you know the cult in the
negative sense and the energy that
rallies a group together to do something
he's probably one of the most magical
storytellers I've ever
met I could listen to one thing he can
get on stage and completely change my
mind about the thing I just
saw so he has an incredible ability to
Rally
 
storytellers people marketers leaders
it's an incredible trait you don't want
to be on the other side of the
fundraising table of that
guy all your money out of your pocket
will be gone right he really is an
incredible just get you going that's
what a lot of the energy was like
working
there there was also like what we
call in global headquarters New York and
then in the
regions in New York where he was it's
it's like getting close to the
sun it's hot it there's a lot of
executive stuff fundraising that I was
not a part of I was the CFO of Western
US and
Canada so I had a lot of the fun
Building without a lot of the I would
say corporate
stuff eventually I I was moved over to
the global team for to be head of
strategic Finance but the other first
part was being a regional leader where
we were just given the money to go
build um so that was really fun um I do
remember one time with Adam
 
he sat down and it was the first time we
ever
met and he
goes you know my my CEO or C weo we have
multiple CEOs of the regions C
weo uh said hey Adam this is Casey he's
the new CFO and and we've actually met
in the past long time ago he doesn't
remember this but anyways we shake hands
and he looks at me he goes you ready to
be in charge of a$2 billion p&amp;l we were
only like
whatever 50 million or something then
but he talks like a Visionary he's like
you ready to
be which is very addicting by the way
it's it's a very big Adrenaline Rush
what I've learned is he's
Israeli so there's a culture that I've
learned is that they're very direct with
you and I think closeness is
directness so I remember saying a line
where I
said uh no I've never run a two billion
p&amp;l but have you ever run a 20 billion
dollar
company and then he gave a nod because
we're both new at this and so there was
a kind of a fun respect of all right
you're okay you know let's go so I
really enjoyed that I really enjoyed
that he pushed us extremely hard and
that's the other thing I talk about is
he would say we're going to regionalize
the pnls one day just just literally
that takes like six months
he's like you got till
Monday and we're like wait are you is
this is he joking it's like I don't
think he's joking and at first we whine
about it it's very similar to West Point
so I went to the
military what they do is they just they
give you one minute miles and everyone's
like not
possible and what happens is you don't
make the one minute mile but you all of
a sudden break four minutes yeah and you
never knew it was possible so working
with him is in a Adrenaline Rush um cuz
the camaraderie gets so
tight we got to do it we didn't make
Monday but we made Friday didn't think
that was possible so anyways and there's
a lot and look it's a party
culture you can call it party you can
call it socialize whatever you want part
of our job was to socialize at community
events there was the summer Retreat
where Red Hot Chili Peppers was
 
mandatory HR had bracelets that said you
need to check in
it's it's part of your job and so yeah
it was a it's a time I'll never forget
yeah that experience must have been so
freaking hard and equally rewarding at
the same time I mean you mentioned
before I back off we work you mentioned
it was kind of like a business school
course what would you tell the audience
Casey that the the two lessons you know
that you do it again that you learn to
do and and then maybe a one that you
wouldn't do again based on that
course well I think the lesson that is
not secret
is the laws of
Economics are like
physics I think Warren Buffett said you
know in the long run a stock is sorry in
the short run a stock is a voting
machine and the long run it's a weighing
machine so for me it
was while we were getting a lot of money
at Big valuations I remind a lot of CFOs
or anyone in business the laws of
economics pertain to every single
business in the world which is so one of
the things I ask people is whatever you
raise
money you say how much was
raised okay whatever that
is and then you ask yourself how long
will it last
us okay say whatever call it 12 months
and then you take the valuation the
second question so how how how what was
and then you say at normalized levels of
multiples going public let's say
how many years would it take or how long
would it take doubling or tripling to
achieve that valuation and if the first
answer is 12 months of Runway and the
second answer is seven
years there's going to be a disconnect
somewhere and there's no free
valuation so that's where it's very
tricky at high growth is the staging and
the Art of
fundraising there's a whole debate over
just be can you just because you can
raise at a certain value do you there's
a lot of debate around that dilution
whatever I mean Adam's doing just fine
right
now so is there right is there wrong I
don't know but there's obviously costs
to be had in all sorts of ways um Equity
shares
retention the board there's a whole
bunch of things so I think that is a
huge reminder
of setting valuations strategically I'm
not saying they didn't but there's just
you know there's a tradeoff depending on
which way you want to go um and you just
own
that the second is a general thing which
is I do think in general I've seen
companies when you go into hyper growth
where you have a lot of
resources the
tendency is to not be as ruthlessly
prioritized so I wrote an article about
like a lot of people think the solution
is hiring more people
 
I've been in the opposite I've been in
compies that are about to they're tooth
and nail like every penny is going to
matter rather than let's go crazy and
scale the
world very very different so culturally
how you
fundraise impacts actions in a massive
way so growth at all costs is a very
different culture that all of us will
succumb to it doesn't matter who you are
versus the opposite of that right just
bootstrap and so take the extreme
and you can see the behaviors
change where all of a sudden some people
who thought they needed 10 people have
one and still get it
done same person just so there's a
little bit of that learning is when I'm
in good
times I tell myself and remind myself
just because we can doesn't mean we're
going to spend it just doesn't mean and
actually keep it tight because it also
taught me what's possible without so
what that's a different company but also
when you you can start to suspect very
quickly when you see that let's come up
with new projects let's go do all this
other
stuff addon priorities I need a chief of
staff and you need a chief of staff oh
you smell it yep and and so it's one of
those like this is a memory where we
need to resist even though we can and
everyone's saying okay yep a lot more
people doing stuff less stuff actually
getting done it's basically restricted
resources forces Innovation constraint
yeah so so so I experienced the opposite
don't get me wrong we innovated a lot
but there's also just a lot of
like a lot of areas where we are
duplicating stuff yep that makes sense
because we're moving at speed so the
other thing is speed actually costs
money going really fast actually there's
a uh break glass so they call it a
growth
tax so if you want to go really fast it
could be I need more assistance and you
need more sales people and because
you're just throwing bodies at it so to
speak so there is an interesting like
equation where sometimes going faster
costs
more it's a little bit counterintuitive
I think those are the lessons I've
learned there's more but that's I think
the big ones what a time to be there and
you know I don't know if we'll ever see
those times again probably never um but
you know Adam going and raising all that
money from Masa like I I just don't know
if we're ever going to see again and so
that actually brings me to my next
question which is around operator Guild
so you have a community of you know 800
 
the best people in Tech what are they
saying about the current
 
climate I'll probably blend a little bit
of AI into this as well
but number one is we went through a very
clear phase
of cutting
back so the mindset swings heavily as
we've seen in Cycles from go go go I
know that at we work
to less is more less is more do more
with less do more with less to the point
where it's become ingrained now like
before it was a reaction like we need to
like cut I think it's extended to the
point where it becomes badge of honor
becomes a thing becomes a mindset
I don't think I don't think for bad but
is a lot of Founders Etc operators
realizing what they can do with less
kind of what I talked about in terms of
when you get real bootstrapped you'll be
surprised what you can
do so I think in a good way that's kind
of here to stay a little bit is the
reminder of do we really need that oh my
God we don't have them and we're okay so
that's
happened someone was talking today about
how the Consulting Market is Ghost
Town that's kind of interesting because
I think the hiring Market is slowly
picking up so I know agencies that went
from what is it you know two positions a
month to now eight yep that's right so
right there you're like okay like
leading indicator happening but why is
the Consulting market and I think it's
because instead of 4r people we can get
by with two right so there's that then
the other thing is AI
AI also I think fuels the efficiency
mind right it g it gives everyone this
mindset of how awesome would it
be to not hire ever and like triple
productivity right which is what the
promise of
AI so I think the struggle is the people
that are looking for jobs right it's
like you're competing with people that
are very cautious with getting back into
overspend and
spending a lot of time going to their
board thinking about how they're going
to promote some AI thing that will save
them even more people
costs and it is true AI the number one
area I've seen is customer
support tell us what you're saying so
there's a company I will leave
unnamed but I think they had something
like 700 people in country
support now they have 35
wow
 
um and the 35 left are mostly all what I
call cross functional
operators they're not the more
verticalized
 
Specialists and that's my
belief is the next phase of operations
is highly skilled multidiscipline
strategic takes in decisions from a lot
of places makes a call translation
sensient and less so I have a skill set
in call center management or sales
or and that's the first indicator of
that who kept their jobs and who lost
their jobs so to
 
speak and then the other side is so
there's people outside looking for job
and then there's people inside that have
jobs working with AI their challenge
will be the risks of
AI so everyone's under the gun to bring
some AI efficiency y every board is
expecting some
initiative and so the talks are going to
be trade-offs we are going to try this
AI the risks are as
follows one company was in
travel and AI started
hallucinating and spitting off travel
that didn't
 
exist okay well that's a
risk and so there's Innovations within
operations for these operators of say
the market of a whole new set of
skills by the way do you guys know how
they solved it how the AI hallucinate
they got another AI to be its boss oh
incredible so what happens is if both
hallucinate it's probably real or it's
not it's very unlikely they hallucinate
identically
so we're as operators we're starting to
become
very Advanced or not Advanced we're
evolving on the AI Dynamics but it's
basically like um Iron
Man You're human inside a machine so
that's what I think it is I don't think
it's like we get replaced I think we
become we get Iron Man suits hey
everyone we'll be right back in a moment
after a word from our
sponsors here's a crazy stat between
hybrid and Frontline employees about 80%
don't typically work in an office so
it's no surprise that digitally engaging
employees is the number one concern for
CEOs as companies go hybrid but as
hybrid is quickly becoming the norm it's
easy for workplaces to start feeling a
little less human yet delighting a
digital Workforce is possible and it can
even be dare we say fun that's where
work Vivo zoom's employee experience
platform comes in if you've ever
recorded spiled at the thought of a
static internet that looks like
something you built in 1995 using Ms
paint have no fear work Vivo is a
dynamic intuitive accessible and mobile
First Tool people actually like using it
which is why companies like ryion Aire
Dollar General virgin and more have
rolled it out to hundreds of thousands
of
employees work vivo's activity feeds
spaces shoutouts and live streams among
other Fe teachers help Elevate the
employee experience like never before
the result dramatically better retention

HR heretic sent
 
you yes um I think we have to coexist as
well it's a matter of how and what pace
and what not and that's my question I
mean do you do you think we're going too
fast on the AR out the companies you
work with your community I mean are we
kind of overdoing it on the pace here
the answer is
yes and the answer is it will not
stop someone taught me something really
interesting he's a
technologist he goes mankind has a
pattern I'll never forget this it was
like oh what's it going to he goes it's
the same pattern always in mankind is we
innovate on something that's very
powerful and we unleash it into the
world but many times we don't we can't
control
it and there's massive good and massive
bad example the
car the combustion engine massive good
climate change problems once it's out
man runs with it good and bad the second
was the nuclear
bomb that technology stop the war has a
lot of bad has a lot of good can't stop
it once the cat is out of the bag
literally man just runs with it the
another one is social
media which is considered a digital
nuclear
bomb now there's people in their homes
making so much money empowered as
business owners because they can do that
there's others that like we got suicide
and mental illness in high schools
another mega bomb of power that no one
no one person or country can control
it's the same thing and now you have
 
ai same it's it's going to be used for
massive good and cure cancer and then
also God knows what frauds and scary
things are happening that is the exact
same thing that's going to happen except
a 10x greater magnitude and speed I
think it's very wise and I'm still
surprised the number of people that have
chosen either the good or the bad only
because the right answer is it's
freaking both yeah and yeah you know
pick whatever you want political issues
this that stances it it usually is
always a mix of both like like why can't
we logically and Reason by reasonable
brain says it's going to be good and
it's going to be bad so let's all work
together to mitigate the cons and reap
the the pros but I still see so many
people picking bad or good podcast
beliefs why is that my my my take on
this Kelly is because we're displacing
the existing
order and that displacing is
uncomfortable unsettled and we don't
know what the future holds so like Casey
mentioned I I think it was was clavio
who had come out in their most recent
earnings report and said that they had
cut their customer support team by 70%
and replaced it with AI and this is
after you know you're hearing like a
bunch of VCS like Mark andreon for
example being like oh we're like we're
over indexing on how this is going to be
bad for people and how we're going to
lose jobs he's they thought of yeah and
and I actually I actually think we are
going to lose a lot of jobs but I think
there's going to be this Delta between
where we are today in this like more
future Utopia thing that like is really
ugly for a lot of people Casey what's
your
take this goes in the line with what
this technology was telling me is uh
before Uber everyone's like
uhoh all these people are going to lose
their jobs as taxi drivers and I don't
know the stats I don't know but somehow
everyone found new
income and in fact I think the study was
more jobs were created due to that so
I'm a little bit of an optimist which is
they're going to
change but there could be more job
creation in a different way maybe this
time's different so but his historically
technology has actually been a job
Creator is what I've Been Told not a job
Destroyer but yes I think there's people
who are used to be customer support that
are like whoa I need to probably apply
my skills doing something
else um so that's my short answer to a
very complicated question is that humans
adapt and it's not going to be like we
have all these homeless people that
can't afford you know it's Something's
Gonna more yeah y yeah yep sorry that's
just kind of a very high level answer
but it seems that way every time yeah a
struggle do not get me wrong there are
people that are but there's a something
new gets created from the displaced I
think your Uber taxi example actually
hit home for me you know I think that's
I think that's right as far as the ad
adaptation yep but it is painful in the
short term because of the unknown mostly
yeah and again like you had taxi drivers
that are like okay I now have to compete
with this app and that is you know and
and especially in you New York to pull L
read a little bit further like these
taxi medallions were like $800,000 or a
million dollars like people had put
their entire life savings into doing
this and then all of a sudden Uber comes
in and rips that out and it does get to
a stasis eventually but it the I think
the short term is where we are right now
is it's it's a new technology Casey you
have a Take On The Rise of the operator
can you explain to our audience what
that
is yes Ser some time in the military so
you see some military analogies then I
became an economics major at
undergrad and was told there was two
steps to Nirvana Step One is go to an
island called Manhattan and get a
banking job at Goldman Sachs or Morgan
Stanley and okay so I went to Morgan
Stanley it was
amazing and the second and last step is
get a hedge fund or private Equity job
hold on to it for 10 15 years and retire
Have You Ever Seen The Big Short it
works The Big Short I like because for
those of you seen it and don't are not
familiar with public Equity investing is
and I'll say it it's a little
controversial it's
lonely if you look at Michael A lot of
it is the adrenaline of the money 99% as
I was in a beautiful corner office
overlooking Central Park lonely and not
happy what I'm saying is I learned that
I'm an
operator and what does that mean I say
this after 40,000 hours later of doing
operations interviewing 12200 operators
and accidentally building the operator
Guild which is is there's a there is a
bunch of us born a certain way I
strongly believe it it's like a dog
you're a hunting dog you see the puppy
hunting dog running around chasing
something it's in our nature and what I
mean by that there is a Persona in the
world that loves to
build I was one of them and you find out
what that is when you put us into a
place where it's transactional and
advisory
audit banking investing
Law
Firm nothing wrong with those
professions they're generally
transactional advisory the McKenzie
partner so what happened is I left
joined a 10p person startup and loved it
so much in Silicon
alley that I moved to Silicon
Valley in Silicon Valley I was walked
into a little
company uh I probably can't name it but
it's a probably the most successful
startup of Our Generation not second
they had about 60 people they are very
Tech
first the recruiter said to me I said I
started off with saying I will work here
for
free I told I've heard everything about
it there were about 60 people at the
time now they're worth about 50
billion and they ask me two questions
they go do you
sell I go no do you
code no then get
out I was like um but I do this thing
called finance and
operations they go oh Finance okay do
you have a
CPA uh no okay then definitely get out
because everyone in the finance
department is a CPA he because you don't
qualify for finance here I was like I
don't qualify for finance here all I've
done for the last 10 years is a word
called Finance Finance in New York is
the Finance in Silicon Valley is
 
you're probably going to censor that one
but my point
is that was 12 years
 
ago and I'm getting to the rise of the
operator which is I am literally one of
those stories except now I just found
out that there's many of us so if you're
following the story
basically I try to join on these
communities go so lonely here I joined a
CFO community no offense
 
it was it it wasn't my FIT let me just
leave it at that I just it just for some
reason I didn't feel like they were I
was get you know that we were the same
type of breed and then I joined Co coo
communities Charming storytellers
Visionaries but not a lot of numbers I'm
I'm obviously being fous right here but
basically there was this extreme and I
was like those are not either of
me and so then nine people almost I
think 10 years to this day got together
for a lunch
meeting that I was invited to and I said
oh my God I feel you people you I like
there's like Finance Ops I said hey do
you guys want to start a little Mom and
Dad's group for operators where we just
help each other I had five rules from
the lessons I've learned elsewhere and
that nine became almost 900 after 10
years I think OG is one of the only
communities in the world world that has
ever grown 100x
organically we don't have a single sales
dollar
ever so the rise of the operator was
this I fell upon it which
is now I'm working full-time is
operators Guild until then I was a
five-time six-time CO CFO so I've been
in the trenches all along the way I've
interviewed 1,200 people for this
group I know operators really really
well that's all I've done and then all
of a sudden all my history with them
something clicked the CFO of brand name
I won't say it here join the COO of
brand name just joined we don't have a
salesperson it literally has been Word
of Mouth we've gone from one city to 20
London just opened up I'm telling you it
literally just keeps going by
itself to the point where I'm full-time
now trying to run it it the universe has
pulled me into this and pulled it into
existence so that's called what we call
reverse product Market fit
so then I have to ask a question I'll
see if you guys get
it it's it's the inspiration for this
air quote book I'm trying to write with
another
operator I asked what demographics are
in the operator's Guild there's four
title personas in the group remind you
it's a paid Community where people come
and go based on their dollars there is
no sales or customer retention program
this is literally come and go word of
mouth so it is literally his most
organic heirloom tomato growing in the
backyard you could possibly believe
so I'm asking the universe what and why
has this group created I'll give you
some facts about the
group we have four title personas
director and above number one is finance
CFO Finance Finance number two coo
Ops head of Ops customer Ops Ops number
three special ops rev Ops Chief of Staff
bizops strategy basically almost no
teams internal ninjas or Consulting and
number four heads of business unit
general manager early CEO founder we
also have 235 unique
titles across 800 that is the highest
unique title ratio to members of
probably any community in the
world why in the world I want to ask you
guys it took me nine and a half years to
get this so if it's 20 seconds don't
worry why would a chief of staff be with
a
Founder be with a big time CFO the CEO
AE of customer Ops a general manager
a
strategist and they keep choosing to
renew in this group and not a chief of
staff group a CFO
group a CEO
group I keep asking why and then it hit
me and that was the inspiration of the
book what do you guys think it
isoss functional business
problems yeah so Taylor to that my
answer would be because that that makeup
of those people in that Community that's
how they live those are the people you
have to work with to build these
businesses is correctly and I'm going to
ask you a tough one is how come HR
operators aren't in there or what's the
deal but that you you don't build an
organization by working with just fellow
CEOs or just Chiefs of Staff you have to
replicate that leadership team HR can be
in there they're absolutely cross
functional it's because HR was such a
supported Community already right right
and so defined legal too so I think
legal and HR also very highly but
they're actually very they can be very
specialized too so there's this world
that it just but a lot of us have people
Ops in us or have led people so the
answer is it's a blurry line um yeah the
answer is we're business
Builders we're generalist so the biggest
message I have is titles have completely
screwed
 
us hey what do you want to do next uh
I've done I'm a two times coo so I'm G
to do coo again
why what's a COO well it's a no that's
your definition there is 1,700 def okay
chief of staff what are you gonna
do then the the question that we have
that's most difficult to answer we as a
Persona I speak on behalf of literally
all the people I've interviewed and like
we
relate what do you do and you guys are
in people you know what recruiting looks
like I need a specialty answer coming
out of you right now because I'm not
going to hire a
generalist oh okay I'm going to play the
part I do Finance I can do public stuff
I do analytics can I get a CFO
job yes you are a CFO so we walk in
there and guess what we do when we get
in we do way more than CFO oh
yeah so the person who joined the
BigTime CFO I said hey why did you join
us and not a CFO group and those are the
best answer and we both answered it
because we're not
CFOs that Nolan is not a people officer
in my mind he's a badass business
Builder who happens to have a discipline
called
people I can build
businesses my discipline is called
Finance so to finish off this cheesy
analogy here in the in the United States
armed forces there's Army Navy and Air
Force pretty clear what they do
they're
Specialists just like
sales engineering and
marketing if you say your sales that is
your title your function your department
and your skill set you're good to go in
this world even HR has that I mean and
people but people's obviously much more
complicated but lawyer got it
engineering got it me or
Nolan I'm not sure where to begin
founder right yep
so why in the world would the US
government spend billions on a program
called Navy
Seals just send in the army or the Navy
and get it done it's no different there
are certain missions in life certain
situations that require
generalists they are funny enough called
Special Operations
Warfare what I've realized about OG is
We Are Special Operations business
building is extremely high paced for us
high stakes not real life and death for
them it is for us it's bankruptcy right
the death of a business but at that type
of speed and lethality I was at a
company burning $100 million a
month that is a different
business than most right so the stakes
and everything are so different that is
the
rise of this Elite operator class you
drop us in we can't help ourselves
we start to just blend into the whole
thing and just fix problems solve
problems Henry ATA said this you know
it's interesting you mention it Casey of
I've never thought about it from the
lens of why titles have created this
problem Henry's take on it was why do we
have job descriptions we should have
problem descriptions Bingo we should
just tell people what problems to solve
versus like throwing them into this box
to where the title ends up
defining them and if you look at the
besto like the best operators whether
it's legal to your point legal HR
Finance revops like the conversations
they're having in an interview process
let's say they're the same
conversations and they maybe touch on a
hit of Flavor of the discipline but the
conversation you're having is about the
business and how to solve it people ask
me how do I know I'm hiring the right
CFO or CPO or I said if their questions
are about business you got a good one
yeah if their questions are about very
tactical specific specialty things well
they're going to be less of a leader
executive in my opinion and more of a
specialist but you nailed it no totally
we are skill-based not title based so
I'll finish off my little cheesy analogy
which is I don't people know but Navy
Seals have disciplines it's called
sniper medic radio and comms they're
specialized in special
things but you don't call them a medic
you called them a seal it's no different
in our world no one's just a business
Builder to me some people call them you
know Chief business off people officer
or something like that no no he just
happens to be a specialist in that area
and if you need that he's a great person
to have on the
team so that's the world IC operators
now is stop calling yourself by your
title that's just one of your majors and
minors that you bring to the table so
the future of operators you start
collecting Majors like I want to take a
class on
revops right so so the majors are
strategic Finance data analytics organ
culture dealing with narcissists
fundraising business intelligence
pricing and packaging that are the
problem sets
yep and then there is sales engineering
that that's fair like those are very
clear problem sets who happen to be
vertical no issue
there but there's a whole set of
orthogonal that's been hiding in in
plain sight that people broke into
things called Chief of Staff yeah Bops
the answer is they do all the same thing
we just jump to the next hole or Gap yep
we are specialists at being generalists
yeah casy you said you accidentally got
a PhD in communities and love the the
journey with with the operators's guild
what what would you tell the audience
about communities these days because
it's it has kind of blown up in a in a
good way um paid unpaid Etc I know you
have views on that or
advice I think people may have forgotten
that a
community is based on relationships I
think some people confuse it with just
what I like to say is do not confuse
friendships with
 
memberships if you actually double click
into friendship and look into the
equation one of the biggest variables is
called time
I bet you there's no friend of yours
that's close that you haven't had time
with timey
lapse best friends generally or
childhood best friends you've gone
through everything together they cannot
become a best friend generally unless
time has
happened you marry that with people
trying to build a business with
Community they're like let's go
now so one of the issues is people focus
too much on the business of
community and they force friendships
 
I think Community is a compounding Time
game
YPO 40 years 50 years one of the most
successful communities in the world
could not be done in four years you can
take their whole Playbook you're not
going to build it that way I think
communities I mean of course there have
been communities built but it's just
that's a very big one is the balance
between 3 exing your friends by
Monday yep and going super super slow
right I think the answer is somewhere in
the middle because you got to have to
like feed the
organization uh so do not forget about
the short you know the people shortcut
basically is a big one about Community
um and the other one's relevance it
sounds so obvious you need to be hyper
relevant OG was accidentally hyper
relevant because there was no Community
for generalists zero no one in their
right mind says I'm going to create a
generalist community that makes no sense
but the answer is we exist we are
actually a community that we didn't know
Alcoholics Anonymous New mom's group
military and seals what do they share in
common hardship being
understood and
relevance and those are some of the most
successful communities in the world the
military the mom's groups and um
Alcoholics Anonymous so it's no
different so if you're going to create a
community it better be very
hyper relevant and understandable and it
has a hardship element I think don't get
me wrong not everything has be hardship
but let me tell you building companies
at our scale and getting tossed out
every 18 months is a very special
hardship that we only understand
especially if you're early State you
don't really have a lot of other people
that you can lean on inside of your
company yet other people have solved the
problem before and I think that's really
for me that the value of the community
is when we have a problem I can't go to
somebody in my company because they
haven't seen this problem before either
we're we're experiencing it for the
first time and that's where you can you
know lean on communities like OG and
just lob your question in and the next
thing you know you have like 20 people
who have done this multiple times to
give different angles so you can form
your own Bingo Casey do you ever Miss
operating that's my one of my last
questions for you I haven't had a chance
to miss it because OG is building on
steroids see what I didn't realize was
this goes back to like titles and
stuff I'm building
OG just like I'd be building another
company under W there you go I'm still
hunting like a hunting
dog it just looks under like a different
tax structure or a different like
whatever I'm called founder or CEO this
is my point whether I was a CFO or a CEO
or a founder or whatever I was chief of
saff I was bizops I carried all of them
it's just problem
solving but I will say for operators I
do think there's a world where we move
to founding like I think founding a
business it is the ultimate autonomy
building high stakes adrenaline rush and
it's your
baby so I think all operators after a
while when they go to am I going to be a
seven time CFO a 19 time
coo I see this all day long
eventually I say why do you need to
always name your title into it it's a
it's a really so what I hear from you I
love your energy and like it's palpable
the the story I used to tell myself and
it sounds like you told yourself a
similar story was like I'll grind for
like 10 to 15 20 years and then I'll be
able to retire and I don't hear any
sense of you like wanting to slow down
have you gone through that change in
your career Arc of like you had the you
told yourself the story of like yeah
like retirement is like you know 4550
and I'm good to go I don't sense that
that's where you are today
no because like you I'm just going to
throw you into the equation it really is
the oh my God my flight just do do what
you love um it really is the whole like
if you do what you love you don't work a
day in your life thing yeah yeah I think
the difference and this is part of the
air quote book is I want to tell all my
operator friends all my generalist
buddies out
there to have confidence it's scary
leaving the home of a big company or
Corporation and just doing your own
thing is scary but what you need to
remember is what we've been trained at
whether we like it or not is business
building like we are some of the best at
it with because of what we had to go
through there's nothing stopping you
from doing your own thing not saying
doing your own thing is better or worse
but you don't have this singular track
of whatever title you were
called so to everyone listening out
there open up the
Horizon because I think there's one
difference between like classic Founders
and us we there's a little bit of ego
I'm going to say it there's a little bit
of conf there's a little bit of
visionary that you kind of need to just
do it it's it's it's a really hard thing
I think a lot of operators are a little
too
self-regulated they're too analytical
and like I don't know and they're like
doing the tradeoffs because that's what
we're good at we do we analyze it stops
us and there's a lot to lose though
there's a lot there's a lot to lose like
their Tech salaries are very real
there's a lot yeah and so we're a little
too
calculated and so we sometimes need a
little push on the other
side which is that variable called what
am I giving you know what am I gaining
to give up it could be gaining huge
things but you have to have a little
confidence of like I can build and
figure it out and I've got some chops to
do it and if I don't know I know who to
hire that's the other power of an
operator we find the right teams and
that becomes Invincible if you thing
about it if you can build any
team you can solve anything look at Elon
build a freaking space company for God's
sakes you know that's and then a car
company he knows how to assemble the
teams or get their so he's like an
ultimate business Builder right so yeah
I I I think that's my biggest message to
everyone is I haven't left operating but
there is the whole like hang your own
shingle or do something a little more oh
my gosh it's all me and there's nothing
wrong at all I mean I think about it
going back I do think investing could be
something interesting to help operators
for me is if I go into the VC world I
can bring Capital to the
game I think the next level for
operators is capital and founding stuff
yep yep I love it Casey woo this was a
master class thanks so much for the time
