the same time I mean you mentioned
before I back off we work you mentioned
 
before I back off we work you mentioned
it was kind of like a business school
 
it was kind of like a business school
course what would you tell the audience
 
course what would you tell the audience
Casey that the the two lessons you know
 
Casey that the the two lessons you know
that you do it again that you learn to
 
that you do it again that you learn to
do and and then maybe a one that you
 
do and and then maybe a one that you
wouldn't do again based on that
 
wouldn't do again based on that
course well I think the lesson that is
 
course well I think the lesson that is
not secret
 
not secret
is the laws of
 
is the laws of
Economics are like
 
Economics are like
physics I think Warren Buffett said you
 
physics I think Warren Buffett said you
know in the long run a stock is sorry in
 
know in the long run a stock is sorry in
the short run a stock is a voting
 
the short run a stock is a voting
machine and the long run it's a weighing
 
machine and the long run it's a weighing
machine so for me it
 
machine so for me it
was while we were getting a lot of money
 
was while we were getting a lot of money
at Big valuations I remind a lot of CFOs
 
at Big valuations I remind a lot of CFOs
or anyone in business the laws of
 
or anyone in business the laws of
economics pertain to every single
 
economics pertain to every single
business in the world which is so one of
 
business in the world which is so one of
the things I ask people is whatever you
 
the things I ask people is whatever you
raise
 
raise
money you say how much was
 
money you say how much was
raised okay whatever that
 
raised okay whatever that
is and then you ask yourself how long
 
is and then you ask yourself how long
will it last
 
will it last
us okay say whatever call it 12 months
 
us okay say whatever call it 12 months
and then you take the valuation the
 
and then you take the valuation the
second question so how how how what was
 
second question so how how how what was
and then you say at normalized levels of
 
and then you say at normalized levels of
multiples going public let's say
 
multiples going public let's say
how many years would it take or how long
 
how many years would it take or how long
would it take doubling or tripling to
 
would it take doubling or tripling to
achieve that valuation and if the first
 
achieve that valuation and if the first
answer is 12 months of Runway and the
 
answer is 12 months of Runway and the
second answer is seven
 
second answer is seven
years there's going to be a disconnect
 
years there's going to be a disconnect
somewhere and there's no free
 
somewhere and there's no free
valuation so that's where it's very
 
valuation so that's where it's very
tricky at high growth is the staging and
 
tricky at high growth is the staging and
the Art of
 
the Art of
fundraising there's a whole debate over
 
fundraising there's a whole debate over
just be can you just because you can
 
just be can you just because you can
raise at a certain value do you there's
 
raise at a certain value do you there's
a lot of debate around that dilution
 
a lot of debate around that dilution
whatever I mean Adam's doing just fine
 
whatever I mean Adam's doing just fine
right
 
right
now so is there right is there wrong I
 
now so is there right is there wrong I
don't know but there's obviously costs
 
don't know but there's obviously costs
to be had in all sorts of ways um Equity
 
to be had in all sorts of ways um Equity
shares
 
shares
retention the board there's a whole
 
retention the board there's a whole
bunch of things so I think that is a
 
bunch of things so I think that is a
huge reminder
 
huge reminder
of setting valuations strategically I'm
 
of setting valuations strategically I'm
not saying they didn't but there's just
 
not saying they didn't but there's just
you know there's a tradeoff depending on
 
you know there's a tradeoff depending on
which way you want to go um and you just
 
which way you want to go um and you just
own
 
own
that the second is a general thing which
 
that the second is a general thing which
is I do think in general I've seen
 
is I do think in general I've seen
companies when you go into hyper growth
 
companies when you go into hyper growth
where you have a lot of
 
where you have a lot of
resources the
 
resources the
tendency is to not be as ruthlessly
 
tendency is to not be as ruthlessly
prioritized so I wrote an article about
 
prioritized so I wrote an article about
like a lot of people think the solution
 
like a lot of people think the solution
is hiring more people
 
I've been in the opposite I've been in
 
I've been in the opposite I've been in
compies that are about to they're tooth
 
compies that are about to they're tooth
and nail like every penny is going to
 
and nail like every penny is going to
matter rather than let's go crazy and
 
matter rather than let's go crazy and
scale the
 
scale the
world very very different so culturally
 
world very very different so culturally
how you
 
how you
fundraise impacts actions in a massive
 
fundraise impacts actions in a massive
way so growth at all costs is a very
 
way so growth at all costs is a very
different culture that all of us will
 
different culture that all of us will
succumb to it doesn't matter who you are
 
succumb to it doesn't matter who you are
versus the opposite of that right just
 
versus the opposite of that right just
bootstrap and so take the extreme
 
bootstrap and so take the extreme
and you can see the behaviors
 
and you can see the behaviors
change where all of a sudden some people
 
change where all of a sudden some people
who thought they needed 10 people have
 
who thought they needed 10 people have
one and still get it
 
one and still get it
done same person just so there's a
 
done same person just so there's a
little bit of that learning is when I'm
 
little bit of that learning is when I'm
in good
 
in good
times I tell myself and remind myself
 
times I tell myself and remind myself
just because we can doesn't mean we're
 
just because we can doesn't mean we're
going to spend it just doesn't mean and
 
going to spend it just doesn't mean and
actually keep it tight because it also
 
actually keep it tight because it also
taught me what's possible without so
 
taught me what's possible without so
what that's a different company but also
 
what that's a different company but also
when you you can start to suspect very
 
when you you can start to suspect very
quickly when you see that let's come up
 
quickly when you see that let's come up
with new projects let's go do all this
 
with new projects let's go do all this
other
 
other
stuff addon priorities I need a chief of
 
stuff addon priorities I need a chief of
staff and you need a chief of staff oh
 
staff and you need a chief of staff oh
you smell it yep and and so it's one of
 
you smell it yep and and so it's one of
those like this is a memory where we
 
those like this is a memory where we
need to resist even though we can and
 
need to resist even though we can and
everyone's saying okay yep a lot more
 
everyone's saying okay yep a lot more
people doing stuff less stuff actually
 
people doing stuff less stuff actually
getting done it's basically restricted
 
getting done it's basically restricted
resources forces Innovation constraint
 
resources forces Innovation constraint
yeah so so so I experienced the opposite
 
yeah so so so I experienced the opposite
don't get me wrong we innovated a lot
 
don't get me wrong we innovated a lot
but there's also just a lot of
 
but there's also just a lot of
like a lot of areas where we are
 
like a lot of areas where we are
duplicating stuff yep that makes sense
 
duplicating stuff yep that makes sense
because we're moving at speed so the
 
because we're moving at speed so the
other thing is speed actually costs
 
other thing is speed actually costs
money going really fast actually there's
 
money going really fast actually there's
a uh break glass so they call it a
 
a uh break glass so they call it a
growth
 
growth
tax so if you want to go really fast it
 
tax so if you want to go really fast it
could be I need more assistance and you
 
could be I need more assistance and you
need more sales people and because
 
need more sales people and because
you're just throwing bodies at it so to
 
you're just throwing bodies at it so to
speak so there is an interesting like
 
speak so there is an interesting like
equation where sometimes going faster
 
equation where sometimes going faster
costs
 
costs
more it's a little bit counterintuitive
 
more it's a little bit counterintuitive
I think those are the lessons I've
 
I think those are the lessons I've
learned there's more but that's I think
 
learned there's more but that's I think
the big ones what a time to be there and
 
the big ones what a time to be there and
you know I don't know if we'll ever see
 
you know I don't know if we'll ever see
those times again probably never um but
 
those times again probably never um but
you know Adam going and raising all that
 
you know Adam going and raising all that
money from Masa like I I just don't know
 
money from Masa like I I just don't know
if we're ever going to see again and so
 
if we're ever going to see again and so
that actually brings me to my next
 
that actually brings me to my next
question which is around operator Guild
 
question which is around operator Guild
so you have a community of you know 800
 
so you have a community of you know 800
 
the best people in Tech what are they
 
the best people in Tech what are they
saying about the current
 
climate I'll probably blend a little bit
 
climate I'll probably blend a little bit
of AI into this as well
 
of AI into this as well
but number one is we went through a very
 
but number one is we went through a very
clear phase
 
clear phase
of cutting
 
of cutting
back so the mindset swings heavily as
 
back so the mindset swings heavily as
we've seen in Cycles from go go go I
 
we've seen in Cycles from go go go I
know that at we work
 
know that at we work
to less is more less is more do more
 
to less is more less is more do more
with less do more with less to the point
 
with less do more with less to the point
where it's become ingrained now like
 
where it's become ingrained now like
before it was a reaction like we need to
 
before it was a reaction like we need to
like cut I think it's extended to the
 
like cut I think it's extended to the
point where it becomes badge of honor
 
point where it becomes badge of honor
becomes a thing becomes a mindset
 
becomes a thing becomes a mindset
I don't think I don't think for bad but
 
I don't think I don't think for bad but
is a lot of Founders Etc operators
 
is a lot of Founders Etc operators
realizing what they can do with less
 
realizing what they can do with less
kind of what I talked about in terms of
 
kind of what I talked about in terms of
when you get real bootstrapped you'll be
 
when you get real bootstrapped you'll be
surprised what you can
 
surprised what you can
do so I think in a good way that's kind
 
do so I think in a good way that's kind
of here to stay a little bit is the
 
of here to stay a little bit is the
reminder of do we really need that oh my
 
reminder of do we really need that oh my
God we don't have them and we're okay so
 
God we don't have them and we're okay so
that's
 
that's
happened someone was talking today about
 
happened someone was talking today about
how the Consulting Market is Ghost
 
how the Consulting Market is Ghost
Town that's kind of interesting because
 
Town that's kind of interesting because
I think the hiring Market is slowly

picking up so I know agencies that went
from what is it you know two positions a
 
from what is it you know two positions a
month to now eight yep that's right so
 
month to now eight yep that's right so
right there you're like okay like
 
right there you're like okay like
leading indicator happening but why is
 
leading indicator happening but why is
the Consulting market and I think it's
 
the Consulting market and I think it's
because instead of 4r people we can get
 
because instead of 4r people we can get
by with two right so there's that then
 
by with two right so there's that then
the other thing is AI
 
the other thing is AI
