Thank you very much. So, here's one
 
Thank you very much. So, here's one
Nolan for today. Hey, I'm writing a Dear
 
Nolan for today. Hey, I'm writing a Dear
Heretex email message that has been long
 
Heretex email message that has been long
overdue. I've had issues with some of
 
overdue. I've had issues with some of
the decisions our founders make,
 
the decisions our founders make,
primarily the CEO, and have been put in
 
primarily the CEO, and have been put in
positions where the company is no longer
 
positions where the company is no longer
operating the gray, but has crossed a
 
operating the gray, but has crossed a
line. And I'm assuming that line, Nolan,
 
line. And I'm assuming that line, Nolan,
is an ethical one or a moral one or a
 
is an ethical one or a moral one or a
valuesbased line. Yeah. Today, our COO
 
valuesbased line. Yeah. Today, our COO
asked me to think about my alignment
 
asked me to think about my alignment
with the company and said,"I need people
 
with the company and said,"I need people
around us to shape the future and not
 
around us to shape the future and not
scold us for the past." This listener
 
scold us for the past." This listener
says, "I know startups can be hard and
 
says, "I know startups can be hard and
that founders like to play fast and
 
that founders like to play fast and
loose, but when issues come up monthly
 
loose, but when issues come up monthly
that go against my morals, I'm now
 
that go against my morals, I'm now
wondering if this is my the right
 
wondering if this is my the right
decision for me. In your experience, is
 
decision for me. In your experience, is
this just startup life or have I found
 
this just startup life or have I found
myself in the wrong leadership team?
 
myself in the wrong leadership team?
Thanks for everything you do. This has
 
Thanks for everything you do. This has
been incredible. I look forward to your
 
been incredible. I look forward to your
show every week. All right, this one's
 
show every week. All right, this one's
tough, Kelly. Um because I have been
 
tough, Kelly. Um because I have been
this person and so I let me just reflect
 
this person and so I let me just reflect
back on my own self first and then you
 
back on my own self first and then you
know we could talk about advice next.
 
know we could talk about advice next.
Okay. So for me when I look back and I
 
Okay. So for me when I look back and I
was in this mode
 
was in this mode
uh the thing that I regret is that I I
 
uh the thing that I regret is that I I
lacked perspective.
 
lacked perspective.
And I felt like that everything was
 
And I felt like that everything was
happening at that moment of my life was
 
happening at that moment of my life was
like the biggest thing going on. And it
 
like the biggest thing going on. And it
it turned out that uh it wasn't that big
 
it turned out that uh it wasn't that big
of a deal. Like with years now of of
 
of a deal. Like with years now of of
perspective, I can look back and say
 
perspective, I can look back and say
like, oh, like that was more startup
 
like, oh, like that was more startup
stuff. Like that was just like kind of
 
stuff. Like that was just like kind of
like bending the rules on some things
 
like bending the rules on some things
and like oh that was like natural course
 
and like oh that was like natural course
of business for like how disagreements
 
of business for like how disagreements
happen. Um, and now as I reflect back
 
happen. Um, and now as I reflect back
and I think about if I were to do it
 
and I think about if I were to do it
again, my general rule of thumb first is
 
again, my general rule of thumb first is
the Bezos quote, which you and I use on
 
the Bezos quote, which you and I use on
the show all the time, which is will you
 
the show all the time, which is will you
gamble with me? And so I think that's
 
gamble with me? And so I think that's
the first thing is like when you're
 
the first thing is like when you're
thinking about these people, are these
 
thinking about these people, are these
people you want to gamble with? And if
 
people you want to gamble with? And if
the answer's no, then you should leave
 
the answer's no, then you should leave
because what's happening with this
 
because what's happening with this
conversation with your COO is it's clear
 
conversation with your COO is it's clear
that they've identified you as somebody
 
that they've identified you as somebody
who's not rowing in the same
 
who's not rowing in the same
direction. And so you have two choices
 
direction. And so you have two choices
now. You start rowing in the same
 
now. You start rowing in the same
direction and you start gambling with
 
direction and you start gambling with
this team or you leave.
 
this team or you leave.
And this third choice of like kind of
 
And this third choice of like kind of
like being in the middle like oh I don't
 
like being in the middle like oh I don't
know on some things and other things
 
know on some things and other things
like it it's just especially if you're
 
like it it's just especially if you're
in leadership roles in startup Kelly
 
in leadership roles in startup Kelly
like you and I both know this like
 
like you and I both know this like
you're all in or you're all out because
 
you're all in or you're all out because
like it's okay to disagree during debate
 
like it's okay to disagree during debate
meetings right before we've made a
 
meetings right before we've made a
decision but once a decision is made
 
decision but once a decision is made
you're in. And it doesn't matter if you
 
you're in. And it doesn't matter if you
agree with it or not. You must be allin
 
agree with it or not. You must be allin
because especially in the people role,
 
because especially in the people role,
right, Kelly? Like we we just we have to
 
right, Kelly? Like we we just we have to
live these things. We have to give the
 
live these things. We have to give the
bet it's due to ensure that we're giving
 
bet it's due to ensure that we're giving
it the opportunity to succeed. And it
 
it the opportunity to succeed. And it
turns out last thing is like it turns
 
turns out last thing is like it turns
out I was wrong all the time on my
 
out I was wrong all the time on my
ideas. Like my founder was actually
 
ideas. Like my founder was actually
right the majority of the time. And so
 
right the majority of the time. And so
you can you suspend disbelief? Like, can
 
you can you suspend disbelief? Like, can
you believe that like your idea might
 
you believe that like your idea might
not work and can you take the other
 
not work and can you take the other
side? And I think that's the ultimate
 
side? And I think that's the ultimate
sign of maturity. Yeah. And I I don't
 
sign of maturity. Yeah. And I I don't
think you're condoning like doing
 
think you're condoning like doing
immoral and illegal things. Like that's
 
immoral and illegal things. Like that's
not the message here. Um No. And it's
 
not the message here. Um No. And it's
not mine either. So, let's just put that
 
not mine either. So, let's just put that
aside. Let's let's let's kind of take
 
aside. Let's let's let's kind of take
this question and take out the fact that
 
this question and take out the fact that
they're doing apparently doing shady
 
they're doing apparently doing shady
things that cross moral lines. Okay.
 
things that cross moral lines. Okay.
Independent of that, you are completely
 
Independent of that, you are completely
correct. And for those of you who are in
 
correct. And for those of you who are in
leadership roles, especially in the
 
leadership roles, especially in the
people role, but any role in the startup
 
people role, but any role in the startup
world, you have to decide what you can
 
world, you have to decide what you can
control, what you can't, what you can
 
control, what you can't, what you can
live with, and what you can't.
 
live with, and what you can't.
Um, the worst thing you can do is stay
 
Um, the worst thing you can do is stay
in a job when you don't agree and when
 
in a job when you don't agree and when
you can't live with it. Like I've seen
 
you can't live with it. Like I've seen
this happen and for those of you who
 
this happen and for those of you who
have been on my leadership teams, you
 
have been on my leadership teams, you
know that I've like hit people over the
 
know that I've like hit people over the
head with a brick multiple times because
 
head with a brick multiple times because
what starts to happen is you start to
 
what starts to happen is you start to
you start to exude that in other ways.
 
you start to exude that in other ways.
You don't think you are, but you're
 
You don't think you are, but you're
talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with people. You're going
 
talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with people. You're going
home talking to your family. You're
 
home talking to your family. You're
spending more energy talking about how
 
spending more energy talking about how
you disagree fundamentally with whatever
 
you disagree fundamentally with whatever
it is than you are doing good work. That
 
it is than you are doing good work. That
comes out in tone, that comes out in
 
comes out in tone, that comes out in
body language, that comes out in how you
 
body language, that comes out in how you
interact with these people. And we said
 
interact with these people. And we said
relationship is the most important
 
relationship is the most important
thing. So once you start like thinking a
 
thing. So once you start like thinking a
certain way and acting a different way
 
certain way and acting a different way
or trying to hide it, you're just kind
 
or trying to hide it, you're just kind
of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Um, so I always tell them
 
of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Um, so I always tell them
like, look, you have to
 
like, look, you have to
decide what what you can tolerate and
 
decide what what you can tolerate and
what what you can change and influence
 
what what you can change and influence
and what you can't. You're going to have
 
and what you can't. You're going to have
to decide to live with it or leave
 
to decide to live with it or leave
because at the end of the day, it's the
 
because at the end of the day, it's the
f it's the founders's company. Um, you
 
f it's the founders's company. Um, you
can go create your own company.
 
can go create your own company.
But I think that's I think that's the
 
But I think that's I think that's the
thing that I've really learned, Nolan,
 
thing that I've really learned, Nolan,
is at the end of the day, whether it's
 
is at the end of the day, whether it's
right or wrong, crazy or not, like I
 
right or wrong, crazy or not, like I
think not that some of these founders
 
think not that some of these founders
are morons I've worked with, but it
 
are morons I've worked with, but it
doesn't matter. You have to make a
 
doesn't matter. You have to make a
decision and live with it or not because
 
decision and live with it or not because
it will it will just come out in
 
it will it will just come out in
different ways. What you're describing
 
different ways. What you're describing
is is somebody who has turned toxic
 
is is somebody who has turned toxic
without knowing they're
 
without knowing they're
toxic. And it happens all the time. Like
 
toxic. And it happens all the time. Like
we we all know this person in our lives
 
we we all know this person in our lives
who is like constantly bitching about
 
who is like constantly bitching about
something but not realizing they're
 
something but not realizing they're
bitching about it all the time. And it
 
bitching about it all the time. And it
to your point, it's not just verbal. And
 
to your point, it's not just verbal. And
there's so many nonverbal cues that
 
there's so many nonverbal cues that
humans pick up on that we're literally
 
humans pick up on that we're literally
like in our DNA coded to pick up on.
 
like in our DNA coded to pick up on.
That's how we made sure we stayed safe
 
That's how we made sure we stayed safe
and people didn't murder us back in the
 
and people didn't murder us back in the
day. Oh jeez. Yes. So yes, now we're
 
day. Oh jeez. Yes. So yes, now we're
going to just take that murderous
 
going to just take that murderous
environment into the startup world. But
 
environment into the startup world. But
I mean that's what it is. Like this is
 
I mean that's what it is. Like this is
like just calling humanity what it is.
 
like just calling humanity what it is.
Yeah. Yeah. But especially for founders
 
Yeah. Yeah. But especially for founders
and what like it's different if you're
 
and what like it's different if you're
right at I refuse to say meta but
 
right at I refuse to say meta but
Facebook and you're you know one of a
 
Facebook and you're you know one of a
million and like but in this intimate
 
million and like but in this intimate
environment and you're a founder Nolan
 
environment and you're a founder Nolan
you were a founder. You you just know
 
you were a founder. You you just know
you know what I mean and and
 
you know what I mean and and
to obviously
 
to obviously
And honestly, like as a fel when it
 
And honestly, like as a fel when it
happens, you know, now that I've been
 
happens, you know, now that I've been
one and I have the empathy, I'm just
 
one and I have the empathy, I'm just
like, we got to get this person the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
 
like, we got to get this person the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
out of here. Yeah. And
 
out of here. Yeah. And
and it's obvious in terms of usually
 
and it's obvious in terms of usually
non-overt things like you just kind of
 
non-overt things like you just kind of
start being more aloof, right? You're
 
start being more aloof, right? You're
not engaging with that leader as much
 
not engaging with that leader as much
anymore. Those things have impacts. Um
 
anymore. Those things have impacts. Um
and you want to get in front of that
 
and you want to get in front of that
before it's too late. Um because the the
 
before it's too late. Um because the the
taboo nature of like stay as long as you
 
taboo nature of like stay as long as you
can and go through the toxicity, it
 
can and go through the toxicity, it
doesn't have to be like that anymore. Um
 
doesn't have to be like that anymore. Um
we we've said many times on this show
 
we we've said many times on this show
that most of the reasons why leadership
 
that most of the reasons why leadership
roles don't work out at early stage
 
roles don't work out at early stage
companies is not because of someone's
 
companies is not because of someone's
technical or functional skills. Yep.
 
technical or functional skills. Yep.
Hopefully, but usually it's because of a
 
Hopefully, but usually it's because of a
difference in style, philosophy, values,
 
difference in style, philosophy, values,
vision, whatever that is. And that's
 
vision, whatever that is. And that's
okay to say. I mean, it's it's becoming

Yeah. So, so this person asked kind of
 
Yeah. So, so this person asked kind of
two questions in my mind, Nolan. One is,
 
two questions in my mind, Nolan. One is,
is this kind of startup life? And I
 
is this kind of startup life? And I
think it is. This is early stage. This
 
think it is. This is early stage. This
is early stage company life. Um, and
 
is early stage company life. Um, and
that that's kind of the nuance of that.
 
that that's kind of the nuance of that.
Now, the moral stuff is a different
 
Now, the moral stuff is a different
level of this. I want to talk about it.
 
level of this. I want to talk about it.
Yeah. I want to talk about So, okay. So
 
Yeah. I want to talk about So, okay. So
I like you know I grew up at Door Dash
 
I like you know I grew up at Door Dash
and you know our biggest competitor was
 
and you know our biggest competitor was
Uber and what people need to understand
 
Uber and what people need to understand
about that era is every ride sharing and
 
about that era is every ride sharing and
uh food delivery
 
uh food delivery
company was not just operating in the
 
company was not just operating in the
gray like we were breaking
 
gray like we were breaking
rules but we were doing it from a
 
rules but we were doing it from a
perspective of these rules don't make
 
perspective of these rules don't make
sense.
 
sense.
like these rules are rules because they
 
like these rules are rules because they
were created in some archaic time before
 
were created in some archaic time before
like the iPhone came out, right? Or uh
 
like the iPhone came out, right? Or uh
it wasn't from like a we're trying to
 
it wasn't from like a we're trying to
harm people perspective. It was in fact
 
harm people perspective. It was in fact
the opposite. And here Uber is the the
 
the opposite. And here Uber is the the
best example of this because like the
 
best example of this because like the
the ride sharing laws like at at that
 
the ride sharing laws like at at that
time was like you had to have a taxi
 
time was like you had to have a taxi
medallion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the
 
medallion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the
taxi companies now would tell you like
 
taxi companies now would tell you like
they effed us. Like they screwed us real
 
they effed us. Like they screwed us real
bad. And there's I think there's a case
 
bad. And there's I think there's a case
to be had there. But on the other side,
 
to be had there. But on the other side,
it's like, well, when I get to the
 
it's like, well, when I get to the
airport now and I'm not in a taxi zone
 
airport now and I'm not in a taxi zone
and I wasn't in one before, like now I
 
and I wasn't in one before, like now I
can get to one because I just use my
 
can get to one because I just use my
phone to get somebody to pick me up and
 
phone to get somebody to pick me up and
I'm on time and I make my my flight and
 
I'm on time and I make my my flight and
I don't have to spend 150 bucks on a
 
I don't have to spend 150 bucks on a
black car service. So I think like a lot
 
black car service. So I think like a lot
of this stuff ends up falling into that
 
of this stuff ends up falling into that
zone. I don't think it's like oh like we
 
zone. I don't think it's like oh like we
are we are like you know undercover
 
are we are like you know undercover
operating like breaking a law that is a
 
operating like breaking a law that is a
law for a good reason. I think it's more
 
law for a good reason. I think it's more
of this like let's bend this because we
 
of this like let's bend this because we
need to bend the world to this new
 
need to bend the world to this new
reality because it hasn't caughten up to
 
reality because it hasn't caughten up to
where modern society is. Yeah. Uh I
 
where modern society is. Yeah. Uh I

my wife and I were talking because we're
 
my wife and I were talking because we're

tright and I'm not meaning it to be that
 
tright and I'm not meaning it to be that
way but like in these startups you're
 
way but like in these startups you're
typically always bending something like
 
typically always bending something like
something's being bent. It's and it's
 
something's being bent. It's and it's
normal and and so I would just encourage
 
normal and and so I would just encourage
you to not be like me like I was 10
 
you to not be like me like I was 10
years ago feeling like we were breaking
 
years ago feeling like we were breaking
all these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rules and instead to
 
all these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rules and instead to
take a step back and say like well how
 
take a step back and say like well how
were these great companies built? Like
 
were these great companies built? Like
what about Airbnb? like you think it was
 
what about Airbnb? like you think it was
legal, like it wasn't. But now we now we
 
legal, like it wasn't. But now we now we
have like now we're looking at it as
 
have like now we're looking at it as
like oh like this is normal now. And so
 
like oh like this is normal now. And so
if you could just imagine yourself 10
 
if you could just imagine yourself 10
years in the future and more
 
years in the future and more
specifically imagine what can go
 
specifically imagine what can go
right and having this like optimistic
 
right and having this like optimistic
outlook, your founder is going to be a
 
outlook, your founder is going to be a
lot happier hanging out with you. Yeah.
 
lot happier hanging out with you. Yeah.
And then right if that all works out and
 
And then right if that all works out and
it was all on the up and up and you're
 
it was all on the up and up and you're
kind of bending in the right way and
 
kind of bending in the right way and
you're successful right your brand
 
you're successful right your brand
becomes every great founder is like you
 
becomes every great founder is like you
got to work with Nolan because he's
 
got to work with Nolan because he's
going to help accelerate you. He's a
 
going to help accelerate you. He's a
great partner. He'll push back. However,
 
great partner. He'll push back. However,
he'll also gamble with you and he'll
 
he'll also gamble with you and he'll
bend with you. And that's how the brand
 
bend with you. And that's how the brand
works.
 
works.
Um it's happened to me. That's how it
 
Um it's happened to me. That's how it
happened. It's such a good point. It's
 
happened. It's such a good point. It's
such a good point, Kelly. Like I think
 
such a good point, Kelly. Like I think
about this with lawyers all the time.
 
about this with lawyers all the time.
Yeah. If you if you're a GNA leader that
 
Yeah. If you if you're a GNA leader that
a founder wants to work with you and not
 
a founder wants to work with you and not
around you, it's gold. It's the the
 
around you, it's gold. It's the the
there's a lawyer um his name's Michael
 
there's a lawyer um his name's Michael
Brown at Fenwick and I I'll give him his
 
Brown at Fenwick and I I'll give him his
flowers because he's so good at this.
 
flowers because he's so good at this.
I'll say something [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane,
 
I'll say something [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane,
right? And Michael will say, "Nolan, I
 
right? And Michael will say, "Nolan, I
think what you meant to say is this."
 
think what you meant to say is this."
And it's like a way better and less
 
And it's like a way better and less
crude way of getting to the exact same
 
crude way of getting to the exact same
outcome that I wanted. Because that's
 
outcome that I wanted. Because that's
the other thing, right, Kelly, is like,
 
the other thing, right, Kelly, is like,
you know, a lot of times founders are
 
you know, a lot of times founders are
talking about outcomes and they're
 
talking about outcomes and they're
hiring you to help them get to the
 
hiring you to help them get to the
outcome. And so like the the the bridge
 
outcome. And so like the the the bridge
from where we are to the outcome is very
 
from where we are to the outcome is very
much under construction every day. Yeah.
 
much under construction every day. Yeah.
You can't assume that just because they
 
You can't assume that just because they
talk insane sometimes, like crude,
 
talk insane sometimes, like crude,
great, great example. So, you're still
 
great, great example. So, you're still
working on it, but I I always say like
 
working on it, but I I always say like
don't assume they mean what they say.
 
don't assume they mean what they say.
