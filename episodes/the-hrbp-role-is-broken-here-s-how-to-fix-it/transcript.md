# The HRBP Role Is Broken: Here's How to Fix It

## Transcript

 
Hey everyone, welcome back to another HR
Heretics show. Today I am so excited to
welcome Lucy Adams. Lucy joins us right
outside of London. What's your town's
name again?
&gt;&gt; It's a place called Stockbridge. So
imagine those Jane Austin films, you
know, it's like that.
&gt;&gt; I love that. So Lucy, you've been doing
this for gez almost 30 years. I'd say
plus or minus looking at your
background.
&gt;&gt; That makes me feel a lot
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great. roles all over the
place, HR leader roles at different
industries and sectors. And for the last
 
HR, which is a term that we're going to
pull apart today to kind of think about
how you think about that word, what it
means, what you're seeing out in the
market, what you've learned for our
audience and HR roles you've had before
this, I have to call it out, is BBC,
which I love. You were HR leader at BBC
out in London. It's just an amazing
place, you know. I mean, I grew up,
anyone who grew up in Britain in the
kind of, you know, 70s and 80s, it was
the backdrop to your life, right? So, to
get the opportunity to go and work at
this place that I had loved all my life
was incredible. And it was incredible,
but it's one of those jobs you
absolutely love and never want to do
again. You're in the public spotlight,
you're in the media, and in HR, we're
not kind of used to that, you know? I
mean, I remember my kind of onboarding.
I had to meet with the head of PR and
communications and he's like, right, you
know, tell me straight away, have you
got a cocaine habit? I'm like, what? I
was like, no. And have you got an
industrial size shredder? Because the
press are going to go through your bins.
I'd love to start with disruptive HR.
Um, tell us about how maybe the years
leading up to you thinking you want to
do this and why and why you chose that
word. I'm kind of long in the tooth HR
director, done that role for most of my
professional career and um, and I kind
of always had slight reservations that
the stuff we were doing wasn't really
working or wasn't really having the
impact. I remember at the BBC going
along and talking to them about the fact
that it was the news division and I was
like, "Great guys, you know, we've
simplified the performance management
process. We're only going to rate people
out of three rather than five and you
can do it all on one page." And I was
thinking, "They're going to love this."
And they're like, "Why do you keep
coming along and depressing us?"
And it was really during my time at the
BBC where we were going through
significant change, you know, whether it
be digital or, you know, changing
workplace expectations, etc. And there
was I still doing HR like I'd done in
the 1990s.
So by the time my kind of stint at the
BBC was coming to an end, myself and my
co-founder Karen Moran, we went for a
very long lunch in Covent Garden and
we're like, look, can we take our shared
frustrations and do something with this?
You know, get off our backsides and
actually come up with ways in which HR
could be fit for a disrupted world. So
that's where disruptive HR comes from.
And and that's what we've been doing for
the last 10 11 years. I think so much of
what HR does is because we don't trust
managers to manage. We speak to
thousands of HR people every year. And
if you ask them kind of what's their
number one issue, it's we have poor
managers with poor capability. But their
response to that is very much around
well let's design a process that makes
them do certain things. Unfortunately, a
lot of the processes that we make them
do don't actually generate the things we
want. They don't improve performance and
motivation. They don't actually help
with talent mobility. And I think
increasingly HR people are struggling
with how to respond to the calls that
come from leadership. So client of ours,
they they had this great thing where
they could bring their dog to work,
right? One day a dog was brought in that
had fleas and the first thing that they
do is write HR design me a policy about
dogs with fleas. And the whole, you
know, the joy sucked out of it.
designing around one individual. Trust
is so important. You know, if you feel
trusted, you are more likely to be able
to embrace change, to challenge the
status quo, to be curious, to be open,
all the things we need in a disrupted
world. Um, if we don't trust, then what
we aim for is passivity, compliance.
People wait to be told, they wait to be
given permission. And I don't think that
sets our businesses up for success. If
you don't trust somebody, deal with the
individual.
&gt;&gt; We had this similar policy at a company
I worked at. And it was great for for
many years until somebody brought a dog
that took a dump in the office. It
smelled all day long. And then it's
like, well, now we don't want this
again. And so what we did was we
actually removed that policy. It is
utopic, right, Kelly? To like try and
design policies around people like who
you do trust. Then once it gets
fractured and it it impacts the
business, you don't want to deal with it
again.
&gt;&gt; Um I think you have to look at the
opportunity costs that you are missing
out on if you design around the
minority. So if you're creating an
environment where you're screaming at
your people, we don't actually trust
you. Even though there's no proof that
they have going to do anything wrong,
the vast majority of us want to come to
work to behave decently, you know, do a
decent job. I'm not saying we're all
stars, but I think the vast majority of
people actually want to come to work and
do a decent job. And if you as an
employer are saying you don't trust the
majority of your people, what are you
doing? I remember working with a um a
company, they did they advised
government on nuclear strategy. You
know, these are serious, seriousminded,
amazing individuals advising governments
on nuclear strategy, but they weren't
trusted to have the keys to the
stationary cupboard. You know, it's like
come on, we've got to kind of get real
here. If you look at those organizations
that have a high trust environment, then
on every measure, productivity,
innovation, even stress levels, they go
in the right direction.
Hey everyone, we'll be right back in a
moment after a word from our sponsors.
AI change is how work gets done.
Recruiting is no exception. Meta View is
the AI platform purpose-built for
recruiting. If you're looking to level
up your AI adoption and see real impact
from intake to offer, it's a no-brainer.
MeteView's suite of AI agents works for
you at every stage of the hiring
process. Their platform powers instant
job post creation, AI powered candidate
Q&amp;A, insights on pipeline performance,
compensation, and so much more. I've
seen firsthand how tough it can be to
extract consistently highquality data
from candidate conversations. I've been
in candidate debriefs where interviewers
told us about their feelings instead of
what actually happened in the interview.
And I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metiv changes all
of that for every candidate in every
pipeline. Bring radical efficiency and
precision to your hiring process with
perfect data from every conversation.
Metiv covers all of your compliance
needs, works with all of your existing
tools, and takes less than 3 minutes to
set up. Join talent leaders at more than
 
Metaview. Just head over to
metaview.ai/heretics
to talk to one of Metav's product
experts or get started for free. You'll
be uprun an AI enabled in minutes.
&gt;&gt; You wrote an article around the HRBP
role recently. Um, and you posed the
question which is like, is this the
toughest role in HR? So, can you just
kind of like lay out the premise for the
article and tell the audience what it
was about?
&gt;&gt; I just really feel for HR business
partners. You know, I've done that role
and we meet lots of HR business partners
who are trying to meet so many needs on
so many fronts. But as an HR business
partner, you are torn between the needs
of the group and your uh CPO who and
your centers of expertise who are trying
to push the latest kind of initiative.
You're trying to meet the needs of your
business unit. Um and you know quite
often they're the ones paying your
salary and I don't think we have
equipped business partners with the
necessary skills. I think we focused a
lot on employee relations
whereas actually I think the role is is
much more of a judgment role. It's about
a coaching and facilitation role rather
than being the expert who everybody
comes to for the answer. Tell me what I
should do. I think the best HR business
partners are the ones that are saying
tell me what it is you're trying to
achieve. You know what decision would
you have got to if I wasn't here? um let
me kind of think through how we can
achieve that and that's that takes
judgment and experience and there's no
kind of clear manual for that.
&gt;&gt; You know the best one that I've ever
been around the thing that she did is is
exactly what you're saying which is kind
of like working backwards from like what
is our goal here like what are we trying
to accomplish and then deconstructing
those things. If I think in the context
of it's 2025 right now, how should we
organize uh and how should we think
about this role and where should this
role sit in the business? I feel like
calling somebody an HRB, it's just like
immediately putting that title on
somebody makes it impossible because of
exactly what you said, Lucy, right? They
serve many masters. Like they have to
look out for themselves, right? Are they
actually are they helping, you know,
lubricate the machine or are they
actually adding friction and slowing
things down?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, we talk about it quite
often almost like an account director
role, you know, an account manager,
somebody that actually is not
necessarily doing all the work, but is
there pulling in expertise where where
it's needed. Um, they know the bit that
part of the business inside out, so
they're able to ask the great questions
and then they pull together the solution
that works. Again, another client of
ours, big retail organization,
um the chief exec was sat down with the
HR director and going, "What is this, a
business partner?" And it's like, well,
it's like somebody that helps with HR.
And it's like, why are you calling it a
business partner? Um, I don't think it's
necessarily an impossible role, but I
think the caliber of people going into
it needs to be a lot higher than perhaps
we see. Um, I think that unfortunately
people who have only done policy or
process work and they're suddenly told,
"Right, you're now a strategic business
partner." A lot of the people who worked
in my team in that role, they got their
kicks from ensuring compliance, helping
managers, but ultimately they're not
there to help. They're there to create
the conditions where people can do their
best work. So, it's stakeholder
management. It's about providing
insights to leaders and managers about
their people and then coaching them and
the best way of getting the right
answers and the right solutions for
those people. I think great HR is really
messy and I don't think we should be
apologetic for that. I think we've tried
so much to emulate finance, you know,
with our language like human capital on
return on investment and and actually I
think it is in the gray. Great HR is
messy and it's not perfect and I think
you know our our superpower is that we
get people and people are messy and we
have you ever watched Billions? You
remember the HBO series Billions? Oh so
you know the kind of psychologist
character to me she's the best HR
person. You know she is super bright.
She is all about performance and the
individuals, but she's she embraces the
fact she knows people. I'm not saying we
all should become psychologists, but I
think we could lose some of the process,
lose some of the policy and say actually
what does help someone improve their
performance. It's certainly not giving
them a rating at the end of the year.
It's about small course corrections. How
do we improve engagement? It's not about
doing an annual annual survey or you
know kind of initiatives. It's actually
about people feeling that they're
trusted and given flexibility. It's
about, you know, so what what are we um
doing around reward? You know, we're
still churning out bonuses, which we
know do not surprise and delight, do not
make people feel good. You ask them
what's the best reward they ever had at
work. No one mentions the end ofear
bonus net of tax six months after year
end. They'll talk about the handwritten
note, you know, they'll talk about the
the customized gift that was just for
them. They'll talk about the shout out
in the team meeting or we know this
stuff and yet we don't deploy it when we
come to design our approach. Yeah. It
reminds me of like remember that segment
we did a while ago, Nolan Wimoff on the
All-In podcast that HR not exists. I
don't feel strongly that that HR should
or shouldn't exist, but I do feel
strongly that if it doesn't, the work
exists. And I think that's what we're
talking about are these these labels.
And um it doesn't really matter where it
sits or what the org is called that that
work does need to exist. And I totally
agree with you, Lucy. Like I I grew up
as an HRBP. It's my DNA. It's like what
I've been doing for 25 years. And you
can't just like go to a weekend seminar
and learn how to be a good HR. Like
there there's no there there's nothing
in there that you can like read and do.
It's why when I I coach HR leaders, I'm
like this is whether you're good or not
at this is a six sense. It's not the
five senses. It's a very nuanced,
artful, right time, right place, right
tone, right? Like and it doesn't really
matter where it sits or what it's
called. You know what I mean? So, and I
think we can get so obsessed with titles
in HR, can't we? You know, I'll often
get go like, why are you called
disruptive HR? You know, HR is such an
oldfashioned term. And it's like, don't
worry about the label. Think about the
contents. You know, get the contents
right. And the label, it doesn't matter.
Should we call it head of people
experience? Should we call it people and
culture? You know, I think only only
teams that are um anxious and and lack
confidence are worrying about what
they're called. Similarly, they you know
teams that individuals who lack
confidence are worried about a seat at
the you know the top table and they get
very anxious about that positional
power. I've been on boards and not on
boards and it hasn't made one iota of
difference to how well I could
influence. It's all about the
relationships. It's all about that
judgment call that you describe.
&gt;&gt; So you have 140,000 people that follow
disruptive HR on LinkedIn. What are you
hearing from that community right now?
Like what are they saying about what's
top of mind for them?
&gt;&gt; The DEI thing is big. So, um, concerns
about kind of where it goes. Is there a
kind of push back post the Trump
administration? By the way, where I
stand on that is that I I think some of
the chief execs have been perhaps uh
blatantly opportunistic about using this
to roll back on things they didn't agree
with in the first place. But equally, I
think DNI can be done so differently.
Um, and again, it's all about
relationships and the conversations.
It's not about policies and process and
compliance and targets. Um, so I think
actually we can use it to to reset. So
that's a biggie. Um, AI huge obviously.
Um but I think it varies between those
organizations and HR teams who have
embraced it and the vast majority of HR
people who are going wa I don't even
know where to get started with this.
Fortunately, I think the kind of human
centric design of HR is coming through
using agile techniques, using marketing
techniques to use, you know, things like
employee persona and customize the
experience. That's interesting. And I
think that's a that's a biggie that's
coming through. Um, and then it's the
old stuff that's still there. Like what
do we do about managers who shouldn't be
anywhere near human beings? you know,
it's like they didn't want to be people
managers and we still got them and we're
still having to deal with them. So,
there's this real dichotomy. On the one
hand, it's like super sexy hi, AI
futuristic stuff and on the other, it's
like how do I get them to have a
conversation with their team
&gt;&gt; on the DEI thing? So I was at uh
transform last week and one of the
panels uh mentioned a a new acronym that
I hadn't heard which was Jedi which is
uh justice equity diversity and
inclusion. So when you think good de
andi is not about policy um but is
instead about conversations what do you
mean?
&gt;&gt; Well I mean just by the way I think you
know having another acronym is the last
thing we need. So let me give you the uh
Atlassian example. So they were looking
at how they could improve the
conversation around diversity, equity,
inclusion. Um because they found that
there were people who were very vocal,
who were interested and there were those
who were probably in the ones in power,
in the majority that were feeling a
little bit either anxious about it,
don't want to say the wrong thing, don't
want to upset someone, um or were
thinking this has got nothing to do with
me. So the conversations were
struggling. They were a lot of feelings
weren't being addressed. A lot of
thoughts weren't being aired. Um people
were getting shouted down. And so they
changed the conversation. They said,
"Look, let's stop talking about minority
groups and how do we get more ethnic
minorities or women or whatever it is.
Let's instead talk about how do we build
more balanced teams." So it was a way of
taking the language into something that
actually we can all agree with. Have you
seen that Accenture inclusion starts
with I. It's a great video on YouTube
that's very simple, very powerful, but
it's just about you've got, you know,
white middle-aged men talking about what
inclusion or exclusion means to them as
well. Um, we've got to find a way of
opening up the conversation, giving it
more acronyms, um, focusing more on
unconscious bias training and so on. I
don't think it's going to work. It's
small little tweaks. It is enabling a
conversation that doesn't alienate and
frighten people. It is about small
little nudges that we can do at the
point where people are making decisions.
It's it's not putting people on
mandatory diversity training. This is
not a quick fix. This is this is small.
So Nestle they said instead of talent
reviews being about um asking the
question who are your brightest and best
who are your stars? So unconscious bias
has already kicked in. They said look
we're going to start a different
conversation which is that you come to
the talent review with the assumption
that everyone in your team is ready to
do something different. Not get promoted
but do something different. come to be
be prepared to talk about everybody. So,
it's just small things, none of which in
and of itself is going to ch change
things dramatically. But I do think the
answer lies in keeping a conversation
going that is open and doesn't alienate
people. And I think the risk is is that
we're seeing a polarization.
And for those organizations who are
still very pro DEI, there is the risk
that a lot of the conversations just go
underground and that's not going to
change anything.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. In 2016, we had a DEI leader at
the company I was at and she left. I
didn't backfill the job for that exact
reason and kind of got tomatoes thrown
at me. In some ways, it's more
important.
it's more important, but it's equally
important that, you know, middle-aged
white guys feel that they have a voice.
And and I know that, you know, there's a
view, well, they've had a voice for so
long and they've had the majority and
they've had the power, but ultimately,
if we're going to change things, we have
to engage with them and and I think
there's a risk that we have ceased to
engage, many of them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I also think we just need to start
talking more about merit. Like what the
we had Joelle on Kelly and I think the
most salient point I've heard somebody
make on this topic is like the ultimate
goal is merit and I feel like that word
has been tarnished a bit but I think the
the ultimate goal is merit and so if
merit is the thing like let's just talk
about that and remove all of the other
acronyms and I think you you can very
quickly get people on board once you
start talking about merit.
&gt;&gt; I think so. I think so.
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome. Well, Lucy, this was a
blast. Thank you so much for the time.
Where can people find you?
&gt;&gt; So, best place is probably the website
disruptivehr.com or they can connect
with me on LinkedIn.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Lucy.
&gt;&gt; Been a pleasure. Thank you.
