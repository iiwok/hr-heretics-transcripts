All right. What's up everybody? Welcome
 
All right. What's up everybody? Welcome
back to another segment of HR Heretics.
 
back to another segment of HR Heretics.
We are going to bring back Dear
 
We are going to bring back Dear
Heretics. And here we go, Kelly. So,
 
Heretics. And here we go, Kelly. So,
Dear Heretics, I'm embarrassed to admit
 
Dear Heretics, I'm embarrassed to admit
this as an HR leader, but I just don't
 
this as an HR leader, but I just don't
feel confident or smart when it comes to
 
feel confident or smart when it comes to
equity. I recently went through a new
 
equity. I recently went through a new
job negotiation and didn't feel prepared
 
job negotiation and didn't feel prepared
regarding equity related questions to
 
regarding equity related questions to
ensure I was getting a great offer with
 
ensure I was getting a great offer with
meaningful upside. Can you talk through
 
meaningful upside. Can you talk through
or roleplay how you have done this and
 
or roleplay how you have done this and
how it should work? Questions to ask,
 
how it should work? Questions to ask,
tips to make sure I can get the best
 
tips to make sure I can get the best
offer. So, Kelly, this is a pretty meaty
 
offer. So, Kelly, this is a pretty meaty
topic here. What's your take? Oh my god,
 
topic here. What's your take? Oh my god,
this is a great one. I I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love
 
this is a great one. I I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love
this topic because it is one that so
 
this topic because it is one that so
many of us and honestly especially HR
 
many of us and honestly especially HR
leaders Nolan they just really don't
 
leaders Nolan they just really don't
understand the nuances and I know you
 
understand the nuances and I know you
have stories around this even you
 
have stories around this even you
personally and folks are like oh my god
 
personally and folks are like oh my god
like I wish I would have known this or
 
like I wish I would have known this or
been smart about this 10 or eight years
 
been smart about this 10 or eight years
ago when I negotiated this offer and I I
 
ago when I negotiated this offer and I I
I think it's always been this kind of
 
I think it's always been this kind of
blackbox box thing in the background,
 
blackbox box thing in the background,
Nolan,
 
Nolan,
that not a lot of people know how to
 
that not a lot of people know how to
work and it literally could cost you
 
work and it literally could cost you
millions of dollars in upside. And it's
 
millions of dollars in upside. And it's
really good to be smart about this. So,
 
really good to be smart about this. So,
this is one of the thing and I'm I don't
 
this is one of the thing and I'm I don't
know everything, but this is one of the
 
know everything, but this is one of the
things that I get the most joy out of
 
things that I get the most joy out of
unveiling the truth for people so they
 
unveiling the truth for people so they
can be smart about it. Totally. So,
 
can be smart about it. Totally. So,
like, you know, before we get into this
 
like, you know, before we get into this
thing, I was one of those people, right?
 
thing, I was one of those people, right?
And so, Kelly, you know this story. I've
 
And so, Kelly, you know this story. I've
told I may have told it once before, but
 
told I may have told it once before, but
for those of you who haven't heard it,
 
for those of you who haven't heard it,
you know, when you see my profile, like,
 
you know, when you see my profile, like,
oh, Nolan was the 50th employee at Tor
 
oh, Nolan was the 50th employee at Tor
Dash. Like, he must be mega rich. Well,
 
Dash. Like, he must be mega rich. Well,
turns out I didn't ask the right
 
turns out I didn't ask the right
questions when I started. And then my
 
questions when I started. And then my
exercise price was higher than I
 
exercise price was higher than I
expected. And so, when I went to
 
expected. And so, when I went to
exercise my shares when I left the
 
exercise my shares when I left the
company, it was going to be a
 
company, it was going to be a
$75,000 check. And like, you know, guys,
 
$75,000 check. And like, you know, guys,
I I came from nothing. So, 75 grand for
 
I I came from nothing. So, 75 grand for
me. Like, even when I had a job at Door
 
me. Like, even when I had a job at Door
Dash was like more money than we had.
 
Dash was like more money than we had.
And oh, by the way, that was every
 
And oh, by the way, that was every
dollar we had in our bank account. We
 
dollar we had in our bank account. We
ended up using that for a down payment
 
ended up using that for a down payment
on a home. And like I I'm fine, but I
 
on a home. And like I I'm fine, but I
walked away from $8 million at IPO
 
walked away from $8 million at IPO
because I couldn't afford the exercise.
 
because I couldn't afford the exercise.
So, I think this is actually a great
 
So, I think this is actually a great
topic to get into, Kelly. So, Kelly,
 
topic to get into, Kelly. So, Kelly,
let's start with your kind of like
 
let's start with your kind of like
checklist. So, say I make an offer to
 
checklist. So, say I make an offer to
you and I want you to be my chief people
 
you and I want you to be my chief people
officer, right? And we're just talking
 
officer, right? And we're just talking
about the equity piece here. So, like
 
about the equity piece here. So, like
we're not going to talk about how cash
 
we're not going to talk about how cash
plays in and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. It's
 
plays in and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. It's
already complicated enough. How are you
 
already complicated enough. How are you
processing the offer? Yes. So, let's
 
processing the offer? Yes. So, let's
talk through it. My first question is,
 
talk through it. My first question is,
so let's just pretend that you offered
 
so let's just pretend that you offered
me a million options. Okay. My first
 
me a million options. Okay. My first
question is, that's great, Nolan. Thank
 
question is, that's great, Nolan. Thank
you. What what is the total shares
 
you. What what is the total shares
outstanding? Right? Meaning the fully
 
outstanding? Right? Meaning the fully
diluted share count. The fully diluted
 
diluted share count. The fully diluted
share count because a million options
 
share count because a million options
could be really great, but it could also
 
could be really great, but it could also
not be really great depending on how
 
not be really great depending on how
many options they've already given away
 
many options they've already given away
that are out in the ether, right? And
 
that are out in the ether, right? And
the math there, the other way to ask
 
the math there, the other way to ask
that is what what percent ownership does
 
that is what what percent ownership does
that million shares represent in the
 
that million shares represent in the
company? So those two things are the
 
company? So those two things are the
same just because that that confused me
 
same just because that that confused me
for a long time. It's simply what is the
 
for a long time. It's simply what is the
grant they're offering you? Divide that
 
grant they're offering you? Divide that
number by the number of fully diluted
 
number by the number of fully diluted
shares, meaning all the options they've
 
shares, meaning all the options they've
already given away. that gives you your
 
already given away. that gives you your
ownership in the company. Correct. And
 
ownership in the company. Correct. And
there was a very large Utah company,
 
there was a very large Utah company,
Qualrix, that used to only give people
 
Qualrix, that used to only give people
the share, like the number of shares,
 
the share, like the number of shares,
and would not tell you any other
 
and would not tell you any other
information. And so you had no idea. And
 
information. And so you had no idea. And
by the way, I know this because
 
by the way, I know this because
candidates told me and also my wife got
 
candidates told me and also my wife got
an offer from Qualrix way way back in
 
an offer from Qualrix way way back in
the day. And so if a company doesn't
 
the day. And so if a company doesn't
disclose that information, major red
 
disclose that information, major red
flag, Kelly, from there, from there,
 
flag, Kelly, from there, from there,
what are you doing? That's a big deal.
 
what are you doing? That's a big deal.
From there, I am asking about the 409A
 
From there, I am asking about the 409A
valuation, which is synonymous with
 
valuation, which is synonymous with
strike
 
strike
price. Okay? Because this this is
 
price. Okay? Because this this is
actually a big deal. And the simple way
 
actually a big deal. And the simple way
to say it is if the 409A valuation is
 
to say it is if the 409A valuation is
$5, for example, the strike price is $5
 
$5, for example, the strike price is $5
per share. What that means is you have
 
per share. What that means is you have
to pay out of pocket
 
to pay out of pocket
$5 for every option you get. So in your
 
$5 for every option you get. So in your
example, five $5 times 1 million options
 
example, five $5 times 1 million options
in order for you to own the option.
 
in order for you to own the option.
That's correct. So, people are like, "Oh
 
That's correct. So, people are like, "Oh
my gosh, I've had people, I'm getting a
 
my gosh, I've had people, I'm getting a
million options at a $5 strike price.
 
million options at a $5 strike price.
I'm getting $5 million in equity." And
 
I'm getting $5 million in equity." And
it's like, okay, no, no, you are you are
 
it's like, okay, no, no, you are you are
only getting value of equity for
 
only getting value of equity for
anything above that $5 strike price. So,
 
anything above that $5 strike price. So,
the only way you're going to make money
 
the only way you're going to make money
in this company is if the company
 
in this company is if the company
valuation grows and the stock is worth
 
valuation grows and the stock is worth
more than $5. So the the other thing to
 
more than $5. So the the other thing to
consider so you should definitely ask
 
consider so you should definitely ask
about the forna FMV right but you should
 
about the forna FMV right but you should
also ask about the last f fair market
 
also ask about the last f fair market
value that's for a FMV strike price all
 
value that's for a FMV strike price all
the same thing now you should also ask
 
the same thing now you should also ask
about the last preferred price and that
 
about the last preferred price and that
price is what the investors paid so if
 
price is what the investors paid so if
you think about it like this investors
 
you think about it like this investors
just paid a you know $150 million
 
just paid a you know $150 million
valuation on the
 
valuation on the
Right? But the strike price is typically
 
Right? But the strike price is typically
about onethird of that, right? And
 
about onethird of that, right? And
that's what you should be looking for is
 
that's what you should be looking for is
like anything like off there, anything
 
like anything like off there, anything
outside of call it the 20 to 40% band.
 
outside of call it the 20 to 40% band.
And it changes as you get later stage.
 
And it changes as you get later stage.
So if it's later stage, it will be
 
So if it's later stage, it will be
actually closer to the preferred price,
 
actually closer to the preferred price,
which is what you're talking about. But
 
which is what you're talking about. But
that's that's the other thing to note,
 
that's that's the other thing to note,
which is like how much do the investors
 
which is like how much do the investors
pay at the last round. And then the
 
pay at the last round. And then the
click in there is like, well, who are
 
click in there is like, well, who are
our investors? Because if really smart
 
our investors? Because if really smart
people are paying high prices, that's
 
people are paying high prices, that's
typically a good signal. Yeah. So, this
 
typically a good signal. Yeah. So, this
is this is a pro tip and this is
 
is this is a pro tip and this is
something that I've seen that that
 
something that I've seen that that
differ by company. Some will do it, some
 
differ by company. Some will do it, some
will not. It's really important to know
 
will not. It's really important to know
about it either way. Let's just say that
 
about it either way. Let's just say that
the company you're, you know, you're
 
the company you're, you know, you're
offering me a million shares, Nolan, at
 
offering me a million shares, Nolan, at
a $5 strike price. um the preferred the
 
a $5 strike price. um the preferred the
preferred value per share, let's say, is
 
preferred value per share, let's say, is
$10 at the last valuation. So, what that
 
$10 at the last valuation. So, what that
means, everyone, is they're saying,
 
means, everyone, is they're saying,
"We're giving you a million shares. It
 
"We're giving you a million shares. It
was $10 per share value at the last
 
was $10 per share value at the last
valuation." And you're like, "Oh my god,
 
valuation." And you're like, "Oh my god,
that's great. That's $10 million." It is
 
that's great. That's $10 million." It is
not $10 million because your strike
 
not $10 million because your strike
price is $5, right? So, your value just
 
price is $5, right? So, your value just
got cut in half. a lot of at today's
 
got cut in half. a lot of at today's
value at today's value, right? Because
 
value at today's value, right? Because
you have to pay that $5 to then get the
 
you have to pay that $5 to then get the
$10, which means $5 net value. So, a lot
 
$10, which means $5 net value. So, a lot
of people confuse and their eyes widen
 
of people confuse and their eyes widen
when they hear the last preferred share
 
when they hear the last preferred share
price was $10 because they forget that
 
price was $10 because they forget that
there is a delta where they have to pay
 
there is a delta where they have to pay
out of pocket to get that
 
out of pocket to get that
$10. Negotiation tactic. A lot of people
 
$10. Negotiation tactic. A lot of people
will say that's wonderful, but I want my
 
will say that's wonderful, but I want my
offer to be based on the net value. Like
 
offer to be based on the net value. Like
I don't want that to be cut in half. So
 
I don't want that to be cut in half. So
if you want me to join your company, you
 
if you want me to join your company, you
need to offer me the share count today
 
need to offer me the share count today
that is using a $5 value, which is the
 
that is using a $5 value, which is the
net value. Does that make sense? Like a
 
net value. Does that make sense? Like a
lot of people don't want to fall for the
 
lot of people don't want to fall for the
trap of forgetting about the out of
 
trap of forgetting about the out of
pocket. They want to solve for that out
 
pocket. They want to solve for that out
of pocket with the offer which is called
 
of pocket with the offer which is called
the net value. And the next thing to
 
the net value. And the next thing to
consider here is can you actually come
 
consider here is can you actually come
up with this
 
up with this
money. So, you know, everyone talks
 
money. So, you know, everyone talks
about golden handcuffs, and this is
 
about golden handcuffs, and this is
actually exhibit A of when it comes into
 
actually exhibit A of when it comes into
play, and golden handcuffs aren't
 
play, and golden handcuffs aren't
actually a thing if you can exercise
 
actually a thing if you can exercise
your options, cuz you could leave
 
your options, cuz you could leave
whatever you want. Now, now maybe
 
whatever you want. Now, now maybe
there's like significant investing on
 
there's like significant investing on
the back end and like that. That's
 
the back end and like that. That's
another version of it. But the one Kelly
 
another version of it. But the one Kelly
and I are talking about right now is
 
and I are talking about right now is
like in this example over four years
 
like in this example over four years
it's going to cost you $5 million if you
 
it's going to cost you $5 million if you
vested everything to exercise these
 
vested everything to exercise these
shares. And so if you so say after 12
 
shares. And so if you so say after 12
months, right, you've hit your first
 
months, right, you've hit your first
cliff and now you've vested the first
 
cliff and now you've vested the first
trunch. So it's still going to cost you
 
trunch. So it's still going to cost you
$1.25 million to leave with your
 
$1.25 million to leave with your
options. you can decide to leave without
 
options. you can decide to leave without
them, but then you are forfeiting them,
 
them, but then you are forfeiting them,
which is kind of like what I did at Door
 
which is kind of like what I did at Door
Dash. And so depending on how you feel
 
Dash. And so depending on how you feel
about the company, this becomes a very
 
about the company, this becomes a very
big financial decision for you and your
 
big financial decision for you and your
family. And that's the other thing to
 
family. And that's the other thing to
really consider here is like given that
 
really consider here is like given that
if we're talking about
 
if we're talking about
options, because you have to have this
 
options, because you have to have this
cash outlay, you have to put skin in the
 
cash outlay, you have to put skin in the
game in addition to your time. And so I
 
game in addition to your time. And so I
think a lot of people miss this, right?
 
think a lot of people miss this, right?
People don't actually like think about
 
People don't actually like think about
it tangibly and don't have conversations
 
it tangibly and don't have conversations
with their their partners or their
 
with their their partners or their
families or whatnot about what this
 
families or whatnot about what this
actually means. And you should scenario
 
actually means. And you should scenario
play. Okay, if I leave in a year, this
 
play. Okay, if I leave in a year, this
is what it's going to cost us to walk
 
is what it's going to cost us to walk
away with these options of which I am
 
away with these options of which I am
trading my time for. I mean, that's part
 
trading my time for. I mean, that's part
of the startup game and that's how
 
of the startup game and that's how
people get wealthy in tech. Yeah. And I
 
people get wealthy in tech. Yeah. And I
wrote down very important to ask if when
 
wrote down very important to ask if when
you all are going through this to help
 
you all are going through this to help
you plan for that financial burden to
 
you plan for that financial burden to
get value out of this. You should ask
 
get value out of this. You should ask
the company what is your exercise window
 
the company what is your exercise window
because some companies when you leave
 
because some companies when you leave
right you'll have only 90 days to come
 
right you'll have only 90 days to come
up with that money. Exactly. Most
 
up with that money. Exactly. Most
companies by the way Kelly the large
 
companies by the way Kelly the large
majority are 90 days. Okay. Yes. The
 
majority are 90 days. Okay. Yes. The
large majority are 90 days. And meaning
 
large majority are 90 days. And meaning
when you leave that company, you only
 
when you leave that company, you only
have three months to come up with a ton
 
have three months to come up with a ton
of cash to keep any options that you
 
of cash to keep any options that you
worked so hard for, or else they're gone
 
worked so hard for, or else they're gone
forever and they're worth nothing. Some
 
forever and they're worth nothing. Some
companies have a longer exercise window.
 
companies have a longer exercise window.
 
companies that do that. Checker did it
 
companies that do that. Checker did it
back in the day. That's wonderful
 
back in the day. That's wonderful
because that means that you don't have
 
because that means that you don't have
to plan to be highly pressured to to to
 
to plan to be highly pressured to to to
shell out money to get them
 
shell out money to get them
quickly. It also can be negotiable. So,
 
quickly. It also can be negotiable. So,
that's something to think about like,
 
that's something to think about like,
hey, I will join your company. I want a
 
hey, I will join your company. I want a
two-year exercise window kind of thing.
 
two-year exercise window kind of thing.
Yeah, the the negotiation point is
 
Yeah, the the negotiation point is
really really a good one. So, a couple
 
really really a good one. So, a couple
things here is Kelly's exactly right on
 
things here is Kelly's exactly right on
the negotiation point. This is really
 
the negotiation point. This is really
where I went wrong at Door Dash. I
 
where I went wrong at Door Dash. I
didn't know it was negotiable. I was
 
didn't know it was negotiable. I was
like, I just want to like get out of
 
like, I just want to like get out of
here and like I want to go to this next
 
here and like I want to go to this next
job and like, okay, you guys can like
 
job and like, okay, you guys can like
and they ended up like buying back my
 
and they ended up like buying back my
shares at a significant discount. I
 
shares at a significant discount. I
wouldn't have done that if I knew I
 
wouldn't have done that if I knew I
could negotiate a longer window. That's
 
could negotiate a longer window. That's
a really really good point, Kelly. A
 
a really really good point, Kelly. A
couple of other just nuanced topics on
 
couple of other just nuanced topics on
this which is any any unex exercised
 
this which is any any unex exercised
options that have a longer
 
options that have a longer
post-termination exercise window than 90
 
post-termination exercise window than 90
days will convert to NSOs. And so I'm
 
days will convert to NSOs. And so I'm
not going to get into the difference of
 
not going to get into the difference of
ISOs and NSOs. It's really not that big
 
ISOs and NSOs. It's really not that big
of a deal depending on where you are.
 
of a deal depending on where you are.
Sometimes it can be, but you should look
 
Sometimes it can be, but you should look
into that and know that that is the
 
into that and know that that is the
truth. The other piece here is so say
 
truth. The other piece here is so say
you join this company, right, Kelly? And
 
you join this company, right, Kelly? And
we were talking about the FMV being a
 
we were talking about the FMV being a
fair FMV strike price for NA all being
 
fair FMV strike price for NA all being
five bucks. Okay. So say after 6 months
 
five bucks. Okay. So say after 6 months
you've been there. Now a new investor
 
you've been there. Now a new investor
comes in or a new new fora is issued and
 
comes in or a new new fora is issued and
now that price goes up to
 
now that price goes up to
$7. So this is really where people get
 
$7. So this is really where people get
screwed. And so if you didn't exercise
 
screwed. And so if you didn't exercise
those shares, which we'll talk about
 
those shares, which we'll talk about
here in a second, then the way the IRS
 
here in a second, then the way the IRS
looks at this when you ultimately do
 
looks at this when you ultimately do
exercise is yes. So say like end of year
 
exercise is yes. So say like end of year
one, we said 1.25 million options have
 
one, we said 1.25 million options have
vested times five. That's like, you
 
vested times five. That's like, you
know, it's going to be 6 million bucks.
 
know, it's going to be 6 million bucks.
Wait, do I have that math right, Kelly?
 
Wait, do I have that math right, Kelly?
I think so. Right. Something like
 
I think so. Right. Something like
something like that. Just use a million,
 
something like that. Just use a million,
dude. Not one point. Okay. Now run this
 
dude. Not one point. Okay. Now run this
back. So, all right, say a million
 
back. So, all right, say a million
shares vest after year one and the the
 
shares vest after year one and the the
strike price was five bucks. So, it
 
strike price was five bucks. So, it
takes you $5 million to exercise those.
 
takes you $5 million to exercise those.
But the IRS is going to is going to come
 
But the IRS is going to is going to come
knock on your door and say, Nolan, but
 
knock on your door and say, Nolan, but
now the FMV strike price is $7. And so,
 
now the FMV strike price is $7. And so,
there's a $2 difference there, right?
 
there's a $2 difference there, right?
And so, it's actually because $2 time a
 
And so, it's actually because $2 time a
million is$2 million. you gained $2
 
million is$2 million. you gained $2
million and now you owe me
 
million and now you owe me
taxes on that $2 million gain. Now, the
 
taxes on that $2 million gain. Now, the
way to avoid this is by early exercising
 
way to avoid this is by early exercising
your options. And so if you're getting
 
your options. And so if you're getting
in at the earliest stage of startups, I
 
in at the earliest stage of startups, I
call it say series B and below, I always

person to understand all this. I think I
 
person to understand all this. I think I
just want everyone to take away that
 
just want everyone to take away that
everything's negotiable. And that's
 
everything's negotiable. And that's
something that I think Nolan and I are
 
something that I think Nolan and I are
saying that we learned a ton is that you
 
saying that we learned a ton is that you
see an offer letter and you don't even
 
see an offer letter and you don't even
see these things, let alone know that
 
see these things, let alone know that
you can ask for them. And that's the
 
you can ask for them. And that's the
biggest thing that I learned is all of
 
biggest thing that I learned is all of
these negotiable things. So, here's
 
these negotiable things. So, here's
another one that might blow your mind,
 
another one that might blow your mind,
which I just got when in my last role.
 
which I just got when in my last role.
You can ask to put in your offer letter
 
You can ask to put in your offer letter
that you want the option to be able to
 
that you want the option to be able to
liqufy and sell your options certain
 
liqufy and sell your options certain
point really
 
point really
this I mean it has to be approved
 
this I mean it has to be approved
obviously and it might not whatever
 
obviously and it might not whatever
asking is the first step and the reason
 
asking is the first step and the reason
is if you're like look for whatever
 
is if you're like look for whatever
reason in your life you need or you want
 
reason in your life you need or you want
or like I'm going to need more cash in a
 
or like I'm going to need more cash in a
year or two like I have goals or I have
 
year or two like I have goals or I have
a family like I I just and know we're
 
a family like I I just and know we're
going to need more
 
going to need more
cash after a year or two years of
 
cash after a year or two years of
tenure. I want commitment that I will be
 
tenure. I want commitment that I will be
able to liqufy some of my shares. So,
 
able to liqufy some of my shares. So,
it's kind of like a mini, you know,
 
it's kind of like a mini, you know,
secondary for yourself. Really? Yes. And
 
secondary for yourself. Really? Yes. And
I'm not saying it's super common. I'm
 
I'm not saying it's super common. I'm
just saying that you can ask for that
 
just saying that you can ask for that
and it might not be possible if the
 
and it might not be possible if the
company goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and everything's
 
company goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and everything's
underwater, of course, but you have it
 
underwater, of course, but you have it
in there to be able to do that. Wow.
 
in there to be able to do that. Wow.
Okay. So, so walk me through that
 
Okay. So, so walk me through that
scenario just a because I've never heard
 
scenario just a because I've never heard
of that before. Like the way I would
 
of that before. Like the way I would
imagine it playing out is the company
 
imagine it playing out is the company
and this is definitely only for
 
and this is definitely only for
executives by the way. So when when
 
executives by the way. So when when
Kelly is talking about negotiation
 
Kelly is talking about negotiation
really what she's saying like this is at
 
really what she's saying like this is at
the exact level like anything director
 
the exact level like anything director
and below if you're trying to negotiate
 
and below if you're trying to negotiate
this stuff they're going to laugh you
 
this stuff they're going to laugh you
out of the room but like so in this case
 
out of the room but like so in this case
Kelly I'm assuming what happened was you
 
Kelly I'm assuming what happened was you
said okay the preferred price is 10
 
said okay the preferred price is 10
bucks if it
 
bucks if it
hits 17 or whatever you know 17 above
 
hits 17 or whatever you know 17 above
whatever we've seen significant
 
whatever we've seen significant
appreciation and I hit two years of
 
appreciation and I hit two years of
service time, then I can sell up to like
 
service time, then I can sell up to like
 
buy those shares back. Do I have that
 
buy those shares back. Do I have that
right? That correct? Yeah. Yep, that
 
right? That correct? Yeah. Yep, that
makes sense. And and it it does get a
 
makes sense. And and it it does get a
little bit complicated just for the
 
little bit complicated just for the
listener of like who buys the shares
 
listener of like who buys the shares
back because if the company's buying
 
back because if the company's buying
them back, they have to buy them back
 
them back, they have to buy them back
off the balance sheet versus if we have,
 
off the balance sheet versus if we have,
you know, other investors lined up,
 
you know, other investors lined up,
right? So, if you're timing this with a
 
right? So, if you're timing this with a
new funding round, it's less of a big
 
new funding round, it's less of a big
deal. But like in this case, depending
 
deal. But like in this case, depending
on how the company's doing and all those
 
on how the company's doing and all those
sorts of things, like you can this this
 
sorts of things, like you can this this
clause can trigger and I can imagine it
 
clause can trigger and I can imagine it
really pissing off a CFO if the timing
 
really pissing off a CFO if the timing
isn't great. Yeah. And look, I'll be
 
isn't great. Yeah. And look, I'll be
honest, it didn't happen. We didn't do
 
honest, it didn't happen. We didn't do
it, but that's not the point. The point
 
it, but that's not the point. The point
is that something you might be able to
 
is that something you might be able to
chat about. That's interesting. I like
 
chat about. That's interesting. I like
that. The other negotiable piece
 
that. The other negotiable piece
obviously is a double trigger. We've
 
obviously is a double trigger. We've
talked about this a lot. Yeah. So, just
 
talked about this a lot. Yeah. So, just
to explain it to the audience, right,
 
to explain it to the audience, right,
which basically means if the company has
 
which basically means if the company has
a liquidation event like an IPO or a
 
a liquidation event like an IPO or a
merger and they fire me, all of my
 
merger and they fire me, all of my
equity vests. Yeah. Yes. Or some of it.
 
equity vests. Yeah. Yes. Or some of it.
Half of it. Yeah. There's there's
 
Half of it. Yeah. There's there's
different Exactly. There's different
 
different Exactly. There's different
mechanisms within the click. People like
 
mechanisms within the click. People like
So, people definitely negotiate this as
 
So, people definitely negotiate this as
time goes on. I actually took a lot of
 
time goes on. I actually took a lot of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the episode that you and I
 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the episode that you and I
talked about this topic. What I learned
 
talked about this topic. What I learned
from that feedback is that for later
 
from that feedback is that for later
stage companies, double trigger becomes
 
stage companies, double trigger becomes
very common. For earlier stage
 
very common. For earlier stage
companies, it's less common. But
 
companies, it's less common. But
regardless, if there is an M&amp;A event,
 
regardless, if there is an M&amp;A event,
your double trigger will be negotiated
 
your double trigger will be negotiated
as part of that merger. So it m it's
 
as part of that merger. So it m it's
kind of like a false security like it
 
kind of like a false security like it
makes you feel good that you have it but
 
makes you feel good that you have it but
when the actual event happens like the
 
when the actual event happens like the
the company who's going to acquire you
 
the company who's going to acquire you
is going to sit down with you and say
 
is going to sit down with you and say
Kelly like hey we saw this you're good
 
Kelly like hey we saw this you're good
or more than likely not actually like
 
or more than likely not actually like
we're not signing this deal with the
 
we're not signing this deal with the
company unless you take these terms and
 
company unless you take these terms and
so people should know that it's it's a
 
so people should know that it's it's a
little bit of false security. Yeah,
 
little bit of false security. Yeah,
sometimes, very rare, sometimes the
 
sometimes, very rare, sometimes the
vesting
 
vesting
schedule can be negotiated. Yep. I would
 
schedule can be negotiated. Yep. I would
definitely not count on it. I don't like
 
definitely not count on it. I don't like
doing it for exacts when they come in.
 
doing it for exacts when they come in.
I'm like, everyone else has this
 
I'm like, everyone else has this
schedule. It's it's really touchy. But
 
schedule. It's it's really touchy. But
sometimes the vesting schedule can be
 
sometimes the vesting schedule can be
negotiated. And I I find that the best
 
negotiated. And I I find that the best
way to negotiate the vesting schedule is
 
way to negotiate the vesting schedule is
also if you're negotiating sever like
 
also if you're negotiating sever like
pre-negotiating
 
pre-negotiating
severance. And I think the fairest thing
 
severance. And I think the fairest thing
that I've seen for pre-negotiated
 
that I've seen for pre-negotiated
severance is like some cash portion in
 
severance is like some cash portion in
addition to we'll just remove the cliff
 
addition to we'll just remove the cliff
of your equity because that that tends
 
of your equity because that that tends
to be like if I fire you after eight
 
to be like if I fire you after eight
months, you walk away with no equity.
 
months, you walk away with no equity.
like as an exec that can be a very very
 
like as an exec that can be a very very
big deal and execs get fired a lot.
 
big deal and execs get fired a lot.
That's kind of the way we leave the
 
That's kind of the way we leave the
building. So that that's something to
 
building. So that that's something to
think
 
think
about. Oh, what a time. So yeah, look,
 
about. Oh, what a time. So yeah, look,
there's a lot of negotiable aspects
 
there's a lot of negotiable aspects
here. I just to to maybe close this, you
 
here. I just to to maybe close this, you
know, I just think irrespective of all
 
know, I just think irrespective of all
the bells and whistles and negotiated
 
the bells and whistles and negotiated
things and please reach out to us if you
 
things and please reach out to us if you
want to learn more or you you know want
 
want to learn more or you you know want
to get smart about this. I think it's
 
to get smart about this. I think it's
really important, but the most important
 
really important, but the most important
thing is do not take an equity grant on
 
thing is do not take an equity grant on
face value and get excited and get all
 
face value and get excited and get all
wound up over
 
wound up over
a sevenf
 
a sevenf
figureure equity grant because it could
 
figureure equity grant because it could
not be what you think. And just make
 
not be what you think. And just make
sure you understand the strike price
 
sure you understand the strike price
versus the preferred share price versus
 
versus the preferred share price versus
the diluted count in your ownership.
 
the diluted count in your ownership.
It's really important. Look, I I'll
 
It's really important. Look, I I'll
actually take it I actually had this
 
actually take it I actually had this
debate about two months ago with the
 
debate about two months ago with the
first employee at Door Dash and where we
 
first employee at Door Dash and where we
both net it out is it's just not the
 
both net it out is it's just not the
company's responsibility. Like I can
 
company's responsibility. Like I can
virtue signal and say companies should
 
virtue signal and say companies should
do a better job and you know educate
 
do a better job and you know educate
their employees, but it's such a
 
their employees, but it's such a
complicated topic. Like you saw in this
 
complicated topic. Like you saw in this
call, I learned something from Kelly in
 
call, I learned something from Kelly in
this call. Like and I worked at Carta
 
this call. Like and I worked at Carta
and so you just can't expect the company
 
and so you just can't expect the company
to educate you. This is your
 
to educate you. This is your
responsibility. It is no one else's
 
responsibility. It is no one else's
responsibility. It's yours. And so you
 
responsibility. It's yours. And so you
you know there's available online
 
you know there's available online
resources. I think it's like Carter 101.
 
resources. I think it's like Carter 101.
Um they put out like a 101 through 103
 
Um they put out like a 101 through 103
series. There's a ton of information
 
series. There's a ton of information
there. It's awesome. Def. the
 
there. It's awesome. Def. the
foundational level you must know. But
 
foundational level you must know. But
the higher you get in your career, the
 
the higher you get in your career, the
more important it is that you get to the
 
more important it is that you get to the
lowest level of detail on these things.
 
lowest level of detail on these things.
And so I would strongly recommend that
 
And so I would strongly recommend that
when you get to this level that you
 
when you get to this level that you
bring in a lawyer to walk you through
 
bring in a lawyer to walk you through
all of these different under different
 
all of these different under different
things, different trade-offs, how to
 
things, different trade-offs, how to
think about stuff. be careful how that
 
think about stuff. be careful how that
lawyer interacts with the company
 
lawyer interacts with the company
because I had this happen one time when
 
because I had this happen one time when
I was negotiating on behalf of a company
 
I was negotiating on behalf of a company
with a candidate who brought in a lawyer
 
with a candidate who brought in a lawyer
and the lawyer was a complete dag and I
 
and the lawyer was a complete dag and I
like didn't want to hire the candidate
 
like didn't want to hire the candidate
anymore. So don't don't be that guy. But
 
anymore. So don't don't be that guy. But
like it is on you. It is on you to to
 
like it is on you. It is on you to to
educate yourself. Yeah. Look, I mean I
 
educate yourself. Yeah. Look, I mean I
don't want everyone to walk away being
 
don't want everyone to walk away being
like I got to get an attorney. I've
 
like I got to get an attorney. I've
never used a lawyer. So like let's not
 
never used a lawyer. So like let's not
overdo the but also talk to people that
 
overdo the but also talk to people that
have done it. Like the online resources
 
have done it. Like the online resources
are great. It is great for surface area
 
are great. It is great for surface area

I should put some, you know, stuff on my
 
I should put some, you know, stuff on my
website around it. I just I love this
 
website around it. I just I love this
topic and I think it's so not talked
 
topic and I think it's so not talked
about enough. Yeah. But every one of
 
about enough. Yeah. But every one of
these deals is bespoke. Like that's the
 
these deals is bespoke. Like that's the
other thing is like what is common place
 
other thing is like what is common place
at one company might be this company's
 
at one company might be this company's
never I literally had a situation today
 
never I literally had a situation today
