All right. What's up everybody? Welcome
back to another segment of HR Heretics.
We are going to bring back Dear
Heretics. And here we go, Kelly. So,
Dear Heretics, I'm embarrassed to admit
this as an HR leader, but I just don't
feel confident or smart when it comes to
equity. I recently went through a new
job negotiation and didn't feel prepared
regarding equity related questions to
ensure I was getting a great offer with
meaningful upside. Can you talk through
or roleplay how you have done this and
how it should work? Questions to ask,
tips to make sure I can get the best
offer. So, Kelly, this is a pretty meaty
topic here. What's your take? Oh my god,
this is a great one. I I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love
this topic because it is one that so
many of us and honestly especially HR
leaders Nolan they just really don't
understand the nuances and I know you
have stories around this even you
personally and folks are like oh my god
like I wish I would have known this or
been smart about this 10 or eight years
ago when I negotiated this offer and I I
I think it's always been this kind of
blackbox box thing in the background,
Nolan,
that not a lot of people know how to
work and it literally could cost you
millions of dollars in upside. And it's
really good to be smart about this. So,
this is one of the thing and I'm I don't
know everything, but this is one of the
things that I get the most joy out of
unveiling the truth for people so they
can be smart about it. Totally. So,
like, you know, before we get into this
thing, I was one of those people, right?
And so, Kelly, you know this story. I've
told I may have told it once before, but
for those of you who haven't heard it,
you know, when you see my profile, like,
oh, Nolan was the 50th employee at Tor
Dash. Like, he must be mega rich. Well,
turns out I didn't ask the right
questions when I started. And then my
exercise price was higher than I
expected. And so, when I went to
exercise my shares when I left the
company, it was going to be a
$75,000 check. And like, you know, guys,
I I came from nothing. So, 75 grand for
me. Like, even when I had a job at Door
Dash was like more money than we had.
And oh, by the way, that was every
dollar we had in our bank account. We
ended up using that for a down payment
on a home. And like I I'm fine, but I
walked away from $8 million at IPO
because I couldn't afford the exercise.
So, I think this is actually a great
topic to get into, Kelly. So, Kelly,
let's start with your kind of like
checklist. So, say I make an offer to
you and I want you to be my chief people
officer, right? And we're just talking
about the equity piece here. So, like
we're not going to talk about how cash
plays in and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. It's
already complicated enough. How are you
processing the offer? Yes. So, let's
talk through it. My first question is,
so let's just pretend that you offered
me a million options. Okay. My first
question is, that's great, Nolan. Thank
you. What what is the total shares
outstanding? Right? Meaning the fully
diluted share count. The fully diluted
share count because a million options
could be really great, but it could also
not be really great depending on how
many options they've already given away
that are out in the ether, right? And
the math there, the other way to ask
that is what what percent ownership does
that million shares represent in the
company? So those two things are the
same just because that that confused me
for a long time. It's simply what is the
grant they're offering you? Divide that
number by the number of fully diluted
shares, meaning all the options they've
already given away. that gives you your
ownership in the company. Correct. And
there was a very large Utah company,
Qualrix, that used to only give people
the share, like the number of shares,
and would not tell you any other
information. And so you had no idea. And
by the way, I know this because
candidates told me and also my wife got
an offer from Qualrix way way back in
the day. And so if a company doesn't
disclose that information, major red
flag, Kelly, from there, from there,
what are you doing? That's a big deal.
From there, I am asking about the 409A
valuation, which is synonymous with
strike
price. Okay? Because this this is
actually a big deal. And the simple way
to say it is if the 409A valuation is
$5, for example, the strike price is $5
per share. What that means is you have
to pay out of pocket
$5 for every option you get. So in your
example, five $5 times 1 million options
in order for you to own the option.
That's correct. So, people are like, "Oh
my gosh, I've had people, I'm getting a
million options at a $5 strike price.
I'm getting $5 million in equity." And
it's like, okay, no, no, you are you are
only getting value of equity for
anything above that $5 strike price. So,
the only way you're going to make money
in this company is if the company
valuation grows and the stock is worth
more than $5. So the the other thing to
consider so you should definitely ask
about the forna FMV right but you should
also ask about the last f fair market
value that's for a FMV strike price all
the same thing now you should also ask
about the last preferred price and that
price is what the investors paid so if
you think about it like this investors
just paid a you know $150 million
valuation on the
Right? But the strike price is typically
about onethird of that, right? And
that's what you should be looking for is
like anything like off there, anything
outside of call it the 20 to 40% band.
And it changes as you get later stage.
So if it's later stage, it will be
actually closer to the preferred price,
which is what you're talking about. But
that's that's the other thing to note,
which is like how much do the investors
pay at the last round. And then the
click in there is like, well, who are
our investors? Because if really smart
people are paying high prices, that's
typically a good signal. Yeah. So, this
is this is a pro tip and this is
something that I've seen that that
differ by company. Some will do it, some
will not. It's really important to know
about it either way. Let's just say that
the company you're, you know, you're
offering me a million shares, Nolan, at
a $5 strike price. um the preferred the
preferred value per share, let's say, is
$10 at the last valuation. So, what that
means, everyone, is they're saying,
"We're giving you a million shares. It
was $10 per share value at the last
valuation." And you're like, "Oh my god,
that's great. That's $10 million." It is
not $10 million because your strike
price is $5, right? So, your value just
got cut in half. a lot of at today's
value at today's value, right? Because
you have to pay that $5 to then get the
$10, which means $5 net value. So, a lot
of people confuse and their eyes widen
when they hear the last preferred share
price was $10 because they forget that
there is a delta where they have to pay
out of pocket to get that
$10. Negotiation tactic. A lot of people
will say that's wonderful, but I want my
offer to be based on the net value. Like
I don't want that to be cut in half. So
if you want me to join your company, you
need to offer me the share count today
that is using a $5 value, which is the
net value. Does that make sense? Like a
lot of people don't want to fall for the
trap of forgetting about the out of
pocket. They want to solve for that out
of pocket with the offer which is called
the net value. And the next thing to
consider here is can you actually come
up with this
money. So, you know, everyone talks
about golden handcuffs, and this is
actually exhibit A of when it comes into
play, and golden handcuffs aren't
actually a thing if you can exercise
your options, cuz you could leave
whatever you want. Now, now maybe
there's like significant investing on
the back end and like that. That's
another version of it. But the one Kelly
and I are talking about right now is
like in this example over four years
it's going to cost you $5 million if you
vested everything to exercise these
shares. And so if you so say after 12
months, right, you've hit your first
cliff and now you've vested the first
trunch. So it's still going to cost you
$1.25 million to leave with your
options. you can decide to leave without
them, but then you are forfeiting them,
which is kind of like what I did at Door
Dash. And so depending on how you feel
about the company, this becomes a very
big financial decision for you and your
family. And that's the other thing to
really consider here is like given that
if we're talking about
options, because you have to have this
cash outlay, you have to put skin in the
game in addition to your time. And so I
think a lot of people miss this, right?
People don't actually like think about
it tangibly and don't have conversations
with their their partners or their
families or whatnot about what this
actually means. And you should scenario
play. Okay, if I leave in a year, this
is what it's going to cost us to walk
away with these options of which I am
trading my time for. I mean, that's part
of the startup game and that's how
people get wealthy in tech. Yeah. And I
wrote down very important to ask if when
you all are going through this to help
you plan for that financial burden to
get value out of this. You should ask
the company what is your exercise window
because some companies when you leave
right you'll have only 90 days to come
up with that money. Exactly. Most
companies by the way Kelly the large
majority are 90 days. Okay. Yes. The
large majority are 90 days. And meaning
when you leave that company, you only
have three months to come up with a ton
of cash to keep any options that you
worked so hard for, or else they're gone
forever and they're worth nothing. Some
companies have a longer exercise window.
 
companies that do that. Checker did it
back in the day. That's wonderful
because that means that you don't have
to plan to be highly pressured to to to
shell out money to get them
quickly. It also can be negotiable. So,
that's something to think about like,
hey, I will join your company. I want a
two-year exercise window kind of thing.
Yeah, the the negotiation point is
really really a good one. So, a couple
things here is Kelly's exactly right on
the negotiation point. This is really
where I went wrong at Door Dash. I
didn't know it was negotiable. I was
like, I just want to like get out of
here and like I want to go to this next
job and like, okay, you guys can like
and they ended up like buying back my
shares at a significant discount. I
wouldn't have done that if I knew I
could negotiate a longer window. That's
a really really good point, Kelly. A
couple of other just nuanced topics on
this which is any any unex exercised
options that have a longer
post-termination exercise window than 90
days will convert to NSOs. And so I'm
not going to get into the difference of
ISOs and NSOs. It's really not that big
of a deal depending on where you are.
Sometimes it can be, but you should look
into that and know that that is the
truth. The other piece here is so say
you join this company, right, Kelly? And
we were talking about the FMV being a
fair FMV strike price for NA all being
five bucks. Okay. So say after 6 months
you've been there. Now a new investor
comes in or a new new fora is issued and
now that price goes up to
$7. So this is really where people get
screwed. And so if you didn't exercise
those shares, which we'll talk about
here in a second, then the way the IRS
looks at this when you ultimately do
exercise is yes. So say like end of year
one, we said 1.25 million options have
vested times five. That's like, you
know, it's going to be 6 million bucks.
Wait, do I have that math right, Kelly?
I think so. Right. Something like
something like that. Just use a million,
dude. Not one point. Okay. Now run this
back. So, all right, say a million
shares vest after year one and the the
strike price was five bucks. So, it
takes you $5 million to exercise those.
But the IRS is going to is going to come
knock on your door and say, Nolan, but
now the FMV strike price is $7. And so,
there's a $2 difference there, right?
And so, it's actually because $2 time a
million is$2 million. you gained $2
million and now you owe me
taxes on that $2 million gain. Now, the
way to avoid this is by early exercising
your options. And so if you're getting
in at the earliest stage of startups, I
call it say series B and below, I always
recommend if you want to own the equity
that you ask the founder about early
exercising because if you early
exercise, which by the way, if a company
tells you no, that's another red flag.
It's an obvious thing to do. This is a a
very easy lever for founders to pull.
It's literally just a column in the
board deck of saying early exercising on
or off.
But if you early exercise, so say you do
that cash outlay early, right? And then
the FMV appreciates, you don't pay the
taxes until the equity becomes
liquid. And that is a very big
difference because if you're walking
away from a company that's seen strike
price appreciation, you're going to pay
to exercise the options and you're going
to pay on that gain between the FMV now
and where you started. Yes. Hey

that AI didn't actually exist in
recruiting or HR. That is until my
friend Heather Dose, who leads talent at
Signal Fire, told me to check out
Metave. I got into the product and was
like, "Wow, AI actually does exist in
recruiting." And this product is sick.
Metiv is the world's number one AI
scribe built specifically for
recruiting. Their AI records and
transcribes hiring conversations like
intakes, interviews, and debriefs, then
provides perfectly summarized notes of
everything that was discussed. I've seen
firsthand how tough it can be to extract
consistently highquality data from
candidate conversations. I've been in
debriefs where interviewers told us
about their feelings instead of what
actually happened in the interview. And
I've seen VPs and CEOs block hires
because they didn't learn anything from
skeleton scorecards. Metaview changes
everything. With perfect notes from
every conversation, your people can
focus on creating a human connection
with candidates and they can save time
on the busy work of cleaning up notes
after every interview. But it's so much
more than just a timesaver because
perfect notes means perfect data for
every candidate in every pipeline.
Hiring teams can make confident,
informed decisions and talent leaders
can finally take control of the
interview process. Metivview covers all
your compliance needs, works with all
your existing tools, and takes less than
 
at organizations like Brex, Deal,
HelloFresh, and Quora, and check out
MeteView. Head over to
metave.ai/heretics to talk to one of
Metabuse's product experts. Tell them
that me and Kelly sent you. Or you could
just go to their website and get started
for free. You'll be up, running, and AI
enabled in minutes.
My recap on that is ask for an early
exercise clause in your offer and get
real smart and cozy up to a tax
person to understand all this. I think I
just want everyone to take away that
everything's negotiable. And that's
something that I think Nolan and I are
saying that we learned a ton is that you
see an offer letter and you don't even
see these things, let alone know that
you can ask for them. And that's the
biggest thing that I learned is all of
these negotiable things. So, here's
another one that might blow your mind,
which I just got when in my last role.
You can ask to put in your offer letter
that you want the option to be able to
liqufy and sell your options certain
point really
this I mean it has to be approved
obviously and it might not whatever
asking is the first step and the reason
is if you're like look for whatever
reason in your life you need or you want
or like I'm going to need more cash in a
year or two like I have goals or I have
a family like I I just and know we're
going to need more
cash after a year or two years of
tenure. I want commitment that I will be
able to liqufy some of my shares. So,
it's kind of like a mini, you know,
secondary for yourself. Really? Yes. And
I'm not saying it's super common. I'm
just saying that you can ask for that
and it might not be possible if the
company goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and everything's
underwater, of course, but you have it
in there to be able to do that. Wow.
Okay. So, so walk me through that
scenario just a because I've never heard
of that before. Like the way I would
imagine it playing out is the company
and this is definitely only for
executives by the way. So when when
Kelly is talking about negotiation
really what she's saying like this is at
the exact level like anything director
and below if you're trying to negotiate
this stuff they're going to laugh you
out of the room but like so in this case
Kelly I'm assuming what happened was you
said okay the preferred price is 10
bucks if it
hits 17 or whatever you know 17 above
whatever we've seen significant
appreciation and I hit two years of
service time, then I can sell up to like
 
buy those shares back. Do I have that
right? That correct? Yeah. Yep, that
makes sense. And and it it does get a
little bit complicated just for the
listener of like who buys the shares
back because if the company's buying
them back, they have to buy them back
off the balance sheet versus if we have,
you know, other investors lined up,
right? So, if you're timing this with a
new funding round, it's less of a big
deal. But like in this case, depending
on how the company's doing and all those
sorts of things, like you can this this
clause can trigger and I can imagine it
really pissing off a CFO if the timing
isn't great. Yeah. And look, I'll be
honest, it didn't happen. We didn't do
it, but that's not the point. The point
is that something you might be able to
chat about. That's interesting. I like
that. The other negotiable piece
obviously is a double trigger. We've
talked about this a lot. Yeah. So, just
to explain it to the audience, right,
which basically means if the company has
a liquidation event like an IPO or a
merger and they fire me, all of my
equity vests. Yeah. Yes. Or some of it.
Half of it. Yeah. There's there's
different Exactly. There's different
mechanisms within the click. People like
So, people definitely negotiate this as
time goes on. I actually took a lot of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the episode that you and I
talked about this topic. What I learned
from that feedback is that for later
stage companies, double trigger becomes
very common. For earlier stage
companies, it's less common. But
regardless, if there is an M&amp;A event,
your double trigger will be negotiated
as part of that merger. So it m it's
kind of like a false security like it
makes you feel good that you have it but
when the actual event happens like the
the company who's going to acquire you
is going to sit down with you and say
Kelly like hey we saw this you're good
or more than likely not actually like
we're not signing this deal with the
company unless you take these terms and
so people should know that it's it's a
little bit of false security. Yeah,
sometimes, very rare, sometimes the
vesting
schedule can be negotiated. Yep. I would
definitely not count on it. I don't like
doing it for exacts when they come in.
I'm like, everyone else has this
schedule. It's it's really touchy. But
sometimes the vesting schedule can be
negotiated. And I I find that the best
way to negotiate the vesting schedule is
also if you're negotiating sever like
pre-negotiating
severance. And I think the fairest thing
that I've seen for pre-negotiated
severance is like some cash portion in
addition to we'll just remove the cliff
of your equity because that that tends
to be like if I fire you after eight
months, you walk away with no equity.
like as an exec that can be a very very
big deal and execs get fired a lot.
That's kind of the way we leave the
building. So that that's something to
think
about. Oh, what a time. So yeah, look,
there's a lot of negotiable aspects
here. I just to to maybe close this, you
know, I just think irrespective of all
the bells and whistles and negotiated
things and please reach out to us if you
want to learn more or you you know want
to get smart about this. I think it's
really important, but the most important
thing is do not take an equity grant on
face value and get excited and get all
wound up over
a sevenf
figureure equity grant because it could
not be what you think. And just make
sure you understand the strike price
versus the preferred share price versus
the diluted count in your ownership.
It's really important. Look, I I'll
actually take it I actually had this
debate about two months ago with the
first employee at Door Dash and where we
both net it out is it's just not the
company's responsibility. Like I can
virtue signal and say companies should
do a better job and you know educate
their employees, but it's such a
complicated topic. Like you saw in this
call, I learned something from Kelly in
this call. Like and I worked at Carta
and so you just can't expect the company
to educate you. This is your
responsibility. It is no one else's
responsibility. It's yours. And so you
you know there's available online
resources. I think it's like Carter 101.
Um they put out like a 101 through 103
series. There's a ton of information
there. It's awesome. Def. the
foundational level you must know. But
the higher you get in your career, the
more important it is that you get to the
lowest level of detail on these things.
And so I would strongly recommend that
when you get to this level that you
bring in a lawyer to walk you through
all of these different under different
things, different trade-offs, how to
think about stuff. be careful how that
lawyer interacts with the company
because I had this happen one time when
I was negotiating on behalf of a company
with a candidate who brought in a lawyer
and the lawyer was a complete dag and I
like didn't want to hire the candidate
anymore. So don't don't be that guy. But
like it is on you. It is on you to to
educate yourself. Yeah. Look, I mean I
don't want everyone to walk away being
like I got to get an attorney. I've
never used a lawyer. So like let's not
overdo the but also talk to people that
have done it. Like the online resources
are great. It is great for surface area
kind of necessary but not sufficient
knowledge. But talk to us, talk to other
people. Like I told you, I coach HR
leaders and two of them are like, I got
to walk through this offer. I'm like, oh
this, this, this, this, this. And it's
like incredible what you can get. Maybe
I should put some, you know, stuff on my
website around it. I just I love this
topic and I think it's so not talked
about enough. Yeah. But every one of
these deals is bespoke. Like that's the
other thing is like what is common place
at one company might be this company's
never I literally had a situation today
where I was talking about early
exercising for me and they were like why
would you want that? And I'm like well
let me tell you why and let me tell you
why everybody wants this. So anyways all
these deals are bespoke. This is like
really like leaning on your tribe.
Kelly's feedback is exactly right. So,
ping us, but only ping us if you've
actually done the foundational research.
Do not ping us if you're like showing up
like what does this mean? Like, ping
somebody else.
Thanks all. All right. See you. HR
