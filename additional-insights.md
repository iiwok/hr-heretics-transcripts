## Zapier's Bar Raiser Structure for Senior Leadership Involvement

**Insight:** Zapier has 10 VPs (for 730 employees—exceptional job level discipline) who act as "Bar Raisers" in hiring. Every candidate meets a VP-level Bar Raiser before receiving an offer. This serves three purposes: (1) apply rigor to ensure every hire is "bar-raising," (2) candidate experience—every new hire meets senior leader before Day 1 and has pre-existing exec relationship, (3) two-way evaluation—exec answers candidate's strategic questions about company.

**Tactics:**
- Involve VP+ level in final interviews for all roles (not just exec hires)
- Bar Raiser asks: "Is this person better than 50% of people currently in this role at our company?"
- Bar Raiser explains company strategy, answers big-picture questions candidates have
- Creates executive relationship before Day 1 (retention benefit)
- Signal of org health: can afford to have 10 VPs spend time on all hires

**Why:** Bar Raisers prevent "hire to fill seat" mentality. They bring fresh perspective unburdened by hiring manager's urgency. Early exec relationship improves retention and onboarding.
